Now I don’t understand.\nAre you saying that you will not use it you are getting new stuff for study?\n- And -\nAre you saying set up an extra move to get it from the beach to Kirkland?\nSent:01/07/2024 at 04:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 04:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: LUGGs\nMessage 271 of 4024\nIf you take the study pieces I will likely look on CL to replace.\nWe have to get the blue couch from beach out so if it fits in the truck let’s just put it in the garage until we solve for it.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 04:19 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 04:21 PM)\nSubject:Re: LUGGs\nMessage 272 of 4024\nBut the truck is going to Bellevue.
