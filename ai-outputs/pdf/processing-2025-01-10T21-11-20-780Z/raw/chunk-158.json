  "text": "Sleep well, queen. I wish you the best\nMessage 584 of 4024\nI spoke to Xfinity’s and they were in the phone with you, connected back with me and confirmed we were separate now and I have no access to your\naccount. If they told me something incorrect that’s on them. I have no access to alki or Bellevue. I am in a separate account.\nThe sleep number I have no idea how to work that. I gave you the remote.\nI could not locate the tv remote in the house you indicated you saw. In fact I don’t know where any remotes to the tvs you dropped off are so they are\nnon functioning too.\nI will also head to alki at some point likely in afternoon after Adrian’s game.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 06:32 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 08:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 585 of 4024\nWhat a nice, non-confrontational note to wake to!\nAgree on Xfinity. And as mentioned, if you are happy with the changes I requested I consider your work to be done. I’ll work with them on my\npassword issue..\nNo worries on bed. I was able to Bluetooth in with my phone. Good news is that I got your side blown up. Bad news is my side is busted. Not your\nissue!\nThe TV remote is there somewhere. Just let me know if you find it. I ordered spares for you yesterday from Amazon. I’ll bring them to the game for\nyou!\nHave an awesome day! Wont push my luck again!\nSent:01/20/2024 at 08:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 09:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 586 of 4024\nIf we need to connect before game you need to swap thoughts. I’ll be bringing you three Samsung universal remotes- living room, sitting room, our\nbedroom. They will need batteries. In a pinch, AD usually has one or two hoarded away and then they have one in the man cave...\nI will also bring you a decaf as usual. Let me know if you would like a 2/3 decaf instead. I’ve been enjoying that lately.\nAdrian should be there 15 minutes early. So 12:45 if you don’t mind. It’s important for us both to set an example. Success is a habit\nSent:01/20/2024 at 11:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 12:10 PM)\nSubject:I’ll check OFW so no misunderstandings",
