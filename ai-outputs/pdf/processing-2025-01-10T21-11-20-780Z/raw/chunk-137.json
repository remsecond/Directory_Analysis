It’s important you learn what has been legally shared with each other.\nDrawing conclusions based on the wrong data or incomplete information in our situation can lead to devastating consequences.\nMessage 504 of 4024\nOdd you are logging on but not reading the message I sent. I think that is the only feature we use here. Should I be using something else?

I can walk you through it. That is what I asked you to do from the start and you began discussing your laptop\nconnection which I had no idea why that was even relevant.\nYou can change it in 30 seconds if you meet me at our mailbox. I will give you my phone, sit in my car with windows rolled up, let you change it on\nthe spot, and then you hand my phone back.\nLosing the diamond status will be expensive as hell. Just let me help you!\nAnd btw- reviewing this thread does not show any instructions. Can I fix it with you?\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity",
