  "text": "Message 402 of 4024\nWhen you sent this, I read it and left immediately. Adrian and I have been texting all weekend and you are correct in that I did not understand the\nsituation as well as I would like to. That goes for both tonight and since this all began. Admittedly I did not grasp the gravity of the situation initially\nand should have treated it with the import and urgency it deserved. In my mind, I had my interpretation of what happened and did not give enough\ncredit to the merit of your interpretation. That was a mistake that I apologize for. I should have been more thoughtful of your perspective. I am sorry.\nWe had a pretty explosive discussion on this topic today. We talked about the back-and-forth between the lawyers and your dissatisfaction with the\ncurrent situation. You told me what your plan of action was and then said that I needed to make it right immediately if I wanted to avoid that\noutcome. I want to be clear that I heard you and have taken action to that end immediately. But there is more to it than that. You feel like your trust\nhas been violated. You feel like that still might be the case. You are not confident in your safety and want to feel comfortable in your own space.\nThat, I agree, is an inalienable right. One that you should not have to ask for. You are entitled to that and I would like to do any and everything in my\npower to assure you have that, not only for yourself but for the children we share. You are all still my family and I would give my dying breath in your\nprotection and I would like the opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Put you at ease. Give you 100% confidence that things you know have happened\nhave an explanation and are not dismissed as crazy musings. No crazymaking, just an honest discussion of the facts comparing our notes.\nWe are clearly in a tenuous legal situation. One that limits our opportunities to speak freely. But... since this all went down, and the gravity of the\nsituation has become clear, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the situation and possible outcomes, peaceful and otherwise.\nAnd because we can't realistically do this in email, I'd like to propose a \"take II\" of our conversation earlier today. I'd like to hear your asks, and present\nthe thoughts I have to see if they might perhaps alleviate your concerns and lay the foundation for an honest path forward peacefully and respectfully.\nIf I may, please note I took time and sat on your email. I am trying to demonstrate the seriousness and respect for the situation I have. And I am scared\nto death to even send this, but I have to try and answer your questions and give you what you need and deserve. If you need time also, please take it.\nBut please consider what I am proposing as well. It may make all the difference in our future.\nSent:01/14/2024 at 10:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 07:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian game  tonight\nMessage 403 of 4024\nI have one xl van Lugg booked for Friday AM\nThe plan is for me to look into getting a big truck as the week progresses and if I can, I will book that and cancel this.\nThe only other question is, if that is not possible, I can book another xl van for noon. Then we use two xl Vans instead of a truck. Still not great but\nthrowing it out there.\nAfter yesterday, I am honestly not expecting a response on this or my other more important offer today.\nThe back and forth was traumatic. But I’m just letting you know what I plan in case you have an objection. That’s all.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 12:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 12:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",
