I will arrange to have Adrian dropped off with you at 9am on Saturday Jan 26th and will be home\nby Sunday Jan 27th for his 7pm drop off with me.\nIn discussions with Max, he is tentative if he will join and is dependent on his Robotics schedule and if he wants to join school ski on Sunday. If he\nchooses not to go and not stay with you, I will arrange for him to stay with Lisa or a friend.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 08:13 AM)\nSubject:Whistler Jan 26 - Jan 29",
