And were a wonderful wife.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/29/2023 at 06:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 123 of 4024\nLots of staring at the ceiling last night.\nI am admittedly scared of our conversation this AM and assume you have some concerns as well. I am\nadmitting I am powerless and am praying to my higher power to show me the way to have a peaceful and constructive conversation this morning,\nbeing thoughtful with my actions and words, and treating you with the respect and dignity you deserve.\nThis, while I ask for grace, cooperation, and maybe even some measure of forgiveness that should not be afforded to me. I pray that we find a way for\nthat being clear eyed that forgiveness does not mean forgetting. And in our case, it specifically means that destructive words and deeds are never\nappropriate, normalized, or permitted again.\nI promise I will try and do my best by you and the family as we have a difficult conversation in an effort to start a long healing process and\nreunification together. I pray my thoughts and words are guided with best intentions rather than self service, in the best interest of all. I wish you the\nbest and that your higher power guides you in the way that is right and appropriate for you as well.\nSent:12/29/2023 at 04:58 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/29/2023 at 06:52 AM)\nSubject:Good Morning and Grace to You (no response necessary)\nMessage 124 of 4024\nPhase 1\n- Max: Saturday Night dinners (every other weekend)\n- Adrian: Saturday 9am - Sunday 7pm (every other weekend).
