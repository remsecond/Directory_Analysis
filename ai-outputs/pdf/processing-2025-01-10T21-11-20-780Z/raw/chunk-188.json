Let’s talk as planned please.\nI don’t want to fight. I just asked if you could show me that you have full custody. I am not going to fight you. I am happy with our parenting plan\nand planning for Dr Brown. Let’s please talk\nSent:01/23/2024 at 11:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 11:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 680 of 4024\nI finally got in\nChrist... I’m reading what you wrote. Christine. Please don’t blow up. What on earth did I do? I agreed with everything you asked below. We also\nagreed (and chatted once already) that Dr Brown for AD is important enough to address today. It’s the way we started this thread.\nAnd the only question I had, I specifically said I would “pause” not fight. Not escalate. Pause. What else can I do to not be confrontational with you\nother than to ask to stop that discussion if it made you mad or we just disagreed. That’s what pause means. Literally.\nWhy are you escalating, making threats, and refusing what you have already agreed is an urgent enough issue to talk immediately. I said I would pause\nChristine. I did not escalate or do anything that should cause you to feel unsafe.\nPlease re-read what I said. I don’t want to fight. Why are you escalating when I asked to stop the discussion and work on the most immediate plan? I\nreally don’t get how asking you to stop a discussion we have a different pov on is worth an escalation.\nWhy are you doing this?\nSent:01/23/2024 at 11:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 11:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 681 of 4024\nMay you please reply? I know you have seen this.\nYou know I did everything in my power to stop the sensitive topic and you know we have to discuss AD.\nCan you please let me know how to proceed without escalation and getting the courts involved now?\nSent:01/23/2024 at 12:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 01:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today",
