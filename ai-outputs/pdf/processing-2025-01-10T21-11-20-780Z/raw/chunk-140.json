  "text": "I tried to work with you and you started yelling and bitching at me from the get-go. You said I was abusing you as you laid into me and would not talk\nabout the move. I repeatedly offered to discuss the move. All you would do is insult me and still refuse to discuss the move.\nIt got to the point that I had to hang up because all you do is complain about self-determining situations that you create and I don't want to be a part\nof that. I told you multiple times we could discuss the move only. That was not acceptable.\nInstead, you want to put your head in the sand and make us do this bullshit exercise where you refuse to cooperate week after week, just like the\nparenting plan you drug on for six months.",
