Please confirm you are telling me the truth, and that is what we are doing. No word play, no cute misdirection, no\nnuance, I asked if it’s what we sent. You said yes below after I was super clear that I did not agree to anything that did not exist. So are we in agreement\nwith what I agreed to because I cannot make it more clear what I am asking in a very unambiguous way.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 03:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 03:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Restraining Orde",
