No matter what.\nDo you ever have plans to show any conflict resolution and civility? I am really hoping we work back to the Alyssa model someday.\nBut I’m honestly concerned you have cast me as such an irredeemable villain to everyone that you can’t show anything else and save face.\nI guess we should be honest if we even share goals of healing and civility or if we are always going to be hateful and demeaning to each other.\nAnd I’m not at all looking to debate it on Xmas eve. I’m just looking for a truthful answer because if it takes time, fine. But “never” is not healthy.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 03:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 03:21 PM)\nSubject:Re: Elsa and Casey\nMessage 31 of 4024\nThis back and forth today is causing ma a lot of anxiety as I feel pressure to respond which was not intention to moving to this platform.
