We made a great plan. Let’s stick with it even if it hit a speed bump. Let’s not talk about the past (that includes\ntoday). Let’s put this behind us and do the best we can by the kids and each other. The golden rule- do unto others, even if it means starting this\nmoment instead of when we talked earlier today. Let’s just move on.\nSincerely wishing the best and hoping to create an honest space where we can trust each other.\nBest\nrobert\nSent:12/26/2023 at 09:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2023 at 09:32 PM)\nSubject:Moving Forward\nMessage 68 of 4024\nThe bigger issue is the tone and accusations you hurl at me off this app in texts, phone calls and emails. You are tracking my movements which is a\nviolation of my privacy, threatening and scary to me. It must stop.\nSent:12/26/2023 at 09:40 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2023 at 09:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moving Forward",
