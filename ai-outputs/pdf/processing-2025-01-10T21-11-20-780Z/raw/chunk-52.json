I’m on duty so will do it.,I did not align with Sirius’s mom for you to bring him home so I will bring him home.

And the whole fight was because you wanted to be sure the world knows we are getting a divorce before Adrian does.\nSo he can find out that way. At least we know he is doing great mentally, so screwing with his head for your own selfish PR belittlement campaign\nmake sense. For last minute change of plans we are supposed to coordinate on text or calls. You have played games all evening now. You are really\nfrustrating to work with.\nSent:01/02/2024 at 06:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 07:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball practice\nMessage 189 of 4024\nWe both got triggered. Let’s stop it all. I am good not to revisit any of this tbh.\nSent:01/02/2024 at 07:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 07:36 PM)\nSubject:Totally Done",
