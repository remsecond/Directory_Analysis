  "text": "myself and the boys. The fact that you feel entitled with no sense of embarrassment, or remorse.  That aspect will move forward in path my lawyer\noutlined. I have undeniable proof that will come out as you push your narrative and deny but your choice.\nIf you thought I was monitoring you in the Tesla, check log ins. Only times you will see is the evening you burst into the Kirkland house demanding I\nuse it to unlock the car and when you called me at work asking for the same as you locked yourself out at a local Sbux. I was unaware of the tracking\nfeature. Furthermore, you control all access and permission settings so I assume you could have deleted me at anytime. Please do so. I have deleted the\napp.\nPlease let your lawyer tell mine any other way you believe I am tracking you.\nYou monitoring me can be proven despite what you may think.\nMessage 393 of 4024\nCan we chat? I would like to pick up where we left off please and be civil about it. I did apologize for saying shut up\nSent:01/14/2024 at 11:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 11:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Language and tone\nMessage 394 of 4024\nI’d like to discuss size, time, logistics.

It is too traumatizing\nand triggering. You have treated me with disrespect in these emails as I outlined below, in your texts and calls .\nYou continue to believe I can be treated differently than other humans. Can be abused, disrespected and my rights violated with consequences.\nNothing left to discuss on move other than scheduling the lugg.\nGiven where we are, it is going to get very uncomfortable and expensive between us. That is your choice given how you chose to behave and\nsubsequent response.\nSent:01/14/2024 at 11:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 11:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Language and tone",
