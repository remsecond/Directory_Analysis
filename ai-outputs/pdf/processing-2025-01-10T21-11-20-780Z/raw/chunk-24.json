I don’t want to fight. It would behoove us both to quit saying the other is the reason we are stuck. I will stop that. If\nyou do it, I won’t address. It’s fine. I just want to wrap this up and move on. Please advise how we can do that?\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 09:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 102 of 4024\nIf you would like to do that, I’m game.\nWe ideally could agree on mutual expectations, but even if we don’t we can at least give it a try. If we make it too hard to work with each other, we can\ncross that bridge when we come to it. But happy to give it another shot in the interest of more productive communications.\nJust let me know.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 10:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 11:53 AM)\nSubject:Moving back to OFW (not urgent)\nMessage 103 of 4024\nJust acknowledging receipt of the AD plans.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 10:56 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 11:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup",
