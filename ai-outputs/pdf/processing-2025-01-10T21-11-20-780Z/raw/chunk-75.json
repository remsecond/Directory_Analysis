So was offering it to you to use in the Kirkland study to replace what I’\nm taking.\nIf neither of us want it, and you are going to get something nicer, I’ll leave it here till we decide what to do with it. I was just giving you the option,\nthat’s all.\nThanks for letting me know so we can work through these things together! Please continue!!’\nSent:01/07/2024 at 03:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 04:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: LUGGs",
