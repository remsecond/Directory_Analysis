Everything was awesome yesterday. Now it’s not. I have not been around him at all. He has only been\nin your company and he won’t seem to talk to me.\nWe have made our problem the kids problem. No matter how awful you think I am, it’s not right. I have begged to speak with one voice since this\nstarted. They don’t even know about the divorce.\nI’d like to sync tonight.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 08:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 09:05 PM)\nSubject:AD\nMessage 611 of 4024\nHe’s fine now. It was the game.\nI have a different perspective on below given He was the one who alerted me to the surveillance.\nI will get the request I sent in email to the lawyer to request to your lawyer. It was clear in OFW but I will do it directly.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 09:08 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 09:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD\nMessage 612 of 4024\nMay we chat about this?\nSent:01/21/2024 at 09:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 09:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD",
