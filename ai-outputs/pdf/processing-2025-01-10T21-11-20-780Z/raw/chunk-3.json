And I have done more than that already but wanted to get today’s in anyway. I have it, it’s ready\nto go.\nBut FedEx seems closed on Sunday. I’ll still send it in if they are open tomorrow, but wanted to let you know in case you had an issue so we can\nresolve.\nI’m not sure what else I can do. Just let me know.\nThanks!\nSent:12/24/2023 at 09:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/05/2024 at 08:49 PM)\nSubject:Random UA\nAttachments:IMG_0607.jpg (5 MB)\nMessage 12 of 4024\nI guess at a minimum I could also just bring it to you so you at least have it secured so you know it’s not late and under your supervision on time???\nSent:12/24/2023 at 09:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 10:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Random UA\nMessage 13 of 4024\nDon’t worry about it.
