Why is that?\nSent:01/11/2024 at 10:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 11:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: My Computer\nMessage 345 of 4024\nI recognize your ask. I will wait to get more stuff.\nYesterday after our argument I backed off all communications. I made a simple request to get my computer today so I could to some resources I need\nfor an interview. I have no idea why you are mad now.\nI am trying to work with you and thought we had a plan, but I can’t get my things and have no reliable way to get in touch with you. That makes it\nhard.\nSent:01/11/2024 at 11:14 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 11:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: My Computer\nMessage 346 of 4024\nCan you please tell me what I did wrong?\nI’m racking my brain\n- I had AD home a couple minutes late\n- I didn’t communicate at all yesterday\n- The TV swap problem is not solved\n- There may be move stuff still in the way\n- You still be mad from our discussion Tues\n- The microwave has not been replaced\n- We have not settled on a mediation date\nI really don’t know, Christine. I am happy to send an update or chat since we skipped running list this week, but nothing is so out of whack that we\ncan’t just set a date/time to resolve. Can we please work together on this? I am so tired of fighting with you!!!\nSent:01/11/2024 at 03:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 03:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: My Computer\nMessage 347 of 4024\nI know you guys don’t use it and it’s really coming down hard here. May I please come get it? My driveway has a steep hill and there is no street\nparking. So if we get snow, I can’t clear it, and then I’m going to be stuck with no way to leave. Thanks!\nSent:01/11/2024 at 03:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 03:49 PM)\nSubject:Snow Blower",
