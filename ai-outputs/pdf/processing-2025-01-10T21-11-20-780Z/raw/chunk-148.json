Please let me know if work email is better, I’m happy to do that, but would prefer not to.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 544 of 4024\nThreats to work email are unacceptable.\nI will reach out to Dr Brown and ask for guidance\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 545 of 4024\nWait. I did not say I was threatening you. That is what you said. No big deal though.All I’m asking for is a way that we can communicate more\nquickly and effectively on our son’s mental health. I’m not trying to fight at all. But when we chat you interrupt and then hang up. We need to do\nbetter and I should have access to my son’s mental health concerns. That is all I am saying.\nAnd I’m not fighting about Dr Brown. Let’s do it. But I think the way you are mandating a unilateral mental health decision is not right. I would like\nsome way to collaborate on his mental health. It’s like if we need to make other health decisions. Or to a much lesser extent something as simple as his\nschool choice or religious freedom. But these are the types of decisions we should make together.\nThat’s all I’m saying. And I don’t want to make a fuss. So please let me know how we work collaboratively like we did so well all day in a timely\nmanner, especially for the health and welfare of our children. I’m their Dad. Until I’m not, it’s a reasonable ask.\nCan we work together please?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 546 of 4024\nThe Kirkland xfinity account was under both our names.\nI have requested updating the Kirkland Xfinity account for change of ownership to just be me under my name, my email, my cell phone.
