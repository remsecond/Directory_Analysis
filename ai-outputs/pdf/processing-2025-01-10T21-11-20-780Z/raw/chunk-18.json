I’m not sure how that happened\nSent:12/27/2023 at 01:40 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 01:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas Gift\nMessage 78 of 4024\nFirst, this is not the kind of thing I expected a quick reply to. We are good on things like this while you are at work in my mind.\nSecond, to be clear, I’m not looking to blame anyone. I hope it did not come across that way. I just wanted to share because we will probably be giving\nhim an unbudgeted $650 unless we want him to learn a hard lesson.\nEither way you might say something to him and say we will let it slide this time but it’s a costly goof. I’ll see if I can use it for something creative so it’s\nnot a total loss.\nSent:12/27/2023 at 01:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 01:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas Gift\nMessage 79 of 4024\nOk. Let’s discuss when things don’t feel so tense. Now I feel anyway I respond is not going to be satisfactory.\nAgree I am at work and will not spend energy on this currently\nSent:12/27/2023 at 01:54 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 01:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas Gift\nMessage 80 of 4024\nTotally agree.\nThat is why I noted it. Let’s discuss but perhaps I just put a tag in the subject line where you can see immediately like: <<nu>> for not urgent or\n<<fyi>> or <<later>>\nBut as the subject says now- not urgent. Let’s make this work for us rather than against. We just need to share mutual expectations.\nSent:12/27/2023 at 02:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 02:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas Gift <<nu>>",
