  "text": "what you asked.\nIt was an impossible dilemma. A catch 22. There are nuances and blame we both would like to disproportionally heap on each other because of the\nawful situation. And neither of us wants to bear the burden of blowing up our family.\nBut I have no desire to fight about that. We are not in a safe enough space to play with that fire yet. In good time after some healing apart we can\nconsider it.\nBut today you said “I want to tell you something I have never told you before, I endured this for twice as long as you and I have never even had a\nmoment to process”... and it made me think- this is so much more than just me involved.\nI have always made the assumption you were full steam ahead. Happy about it all and loving your decision. No concerns, you won the lottery with\nthat July 5th call- No more Big. And tbh I don’t see the collateral damage weighing on you in the least.\nSo what? Here’s what- the last six months have been sheer unadulterated hell. We have compounded our problem 10x fold. And we created our own\never worsening self fulfilling prophecy of literal doom. And we are spiraling out of control.\nWe can’t turn back time. Too much blood has been shed to forget. But, we still control our future. And we know now so much left unsaid has done\nso much damage, that we should consider doing something different moving forward.\nIn your moment of transparency and honesty I honestly understood where you were coming from. I get it. Finally a window into the black box of\ninexplicable despair that I needed desperately to understand. I even think we have a lot in common.\nThese moments, these hard, honest truths, if we open up, like we have not before, will allow us to be relatable and show vulnerability to each others\nperspective. We don’t have to be right, we just have to make an effort to understand each other.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 10:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Please Consider in a Quiet Moment",
