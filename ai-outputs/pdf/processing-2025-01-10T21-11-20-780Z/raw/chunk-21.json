  "text": "If you have an issue with this then I don’t have the energy to fight and propose to bank the room unless you decide you want to use it without the kids\nI’m not looking to do a back and forth on this with quick response times.\nThe comment of 21 hours dark. If there is no emergency then that should be the norm if not longer.\nMessage 87 of 4024\nStart a separate thread. Agree let’s minimize the back and forth and expected response time.\nI’ll review Dr. Brown guidelines but she had expected response time in there. It feels like you are tracking when I read the emails and then expecting an\nimmediate response.\nThe communication should be limited to normal hours without expectation for calls, texts, emails early morning or late evenings.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 88 of 4024\nIf you are proposing that I expect that we go 21 hours without so much as a reply, I’ll probably ask we use another method of communication. You\nare in my home and have most everything I own. We can talk about the other later. But that is not going to work.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Spring Break (not urgent)\nMessage 89 of 4024\nLast night after I proposed setting mutual expectations that you would not be on here at night or day. And now you just said it will be a minimum of\n21 hours. I have tried to work with you but you refuse because you were angry about an email that I sent in good faith. You are not working with me.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:14 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 90 of 4024\nSee email communication protocols.\nIf you need access to your things, it has been 6 months. Let’s arrange a date/time for you to remove your items. I need to be in a home that I do not\nfeel threatened. We are not in a nesting situation.\nIf you refuse options are to sell the home now or I move out with the boys and you move in.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:27 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nAttachments:IMG_9307.PNG (456 KB)",
