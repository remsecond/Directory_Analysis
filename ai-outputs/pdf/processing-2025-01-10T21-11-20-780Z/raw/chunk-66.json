  "text": "uncomfortable. Calls were also very contentious.\nMy request to OFW was to mitigate that.\nI am happy to reengage Dr Brown on this topic for additional guidance if requested.\nMessage 232 of 4024\nThat is not what it says.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 11:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 11:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown 12/16\nMessage 233 of 4024\nWe just had a fight... whatever. We are mature enough not to make a big deal out of it. Ideally, we can be honest about each of our roles- both\ntriggering and responding. Given that two wrongs never make a right, we are equally at fault and share the blame 50/50. Lets learn and correct.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 01:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 05:59 PM)\nSubject:Confirming Events\nMessage 234 of 4024\nHoping we can both acknowledge we each have a POV and just deescalate our entire situation this afternoon. Let’s figure this out.\nI will transparent and say I am not going into mediation with this kind of acrimony. That is my legal right and it is one I will exercise.\nI’ll be happy to when we are ready to treat each other with the dignity and respect that we owe each other after 29 years and three kids together.\nHow do we make peace instead of living out these awful self fulfilling prophecies? I’m all ears!\nSent:01/04/2024 at 04:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 06:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Confirming Events\nMessage 235 of 4024\nRefusing to mediate means we wait for the court date in September and it goes to trial in front of a judge. That is your choice and right but I am clear\nI would prefer mediation.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 06:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 06:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Confirming Events",
