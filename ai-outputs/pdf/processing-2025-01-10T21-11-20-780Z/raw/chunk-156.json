Coming to the door putting your foot over the threshold so I could not close it, and screaming at me.\nThe children were witness to that behavior\nSent:01/19/2024 at 07:31 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 07:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Heading Over\nMessage 580 of 4024\nI bent over backward for you all day. I helped you every way I could possibly help. I told you I need the remotes that you said were left. We agreed I\nwould get them. Then you lock me out of my own Xfinity account so only you have access to it. Then you proceed to play OFW games all night till I’\nm done with it. I fixed your screw up with Xfinity. Happy to share details and then told you I was coming over as we agreed.\nYou had not checked OFW for hours and that is the only way I can reach you. When I arrive you expect me to have checked OFW like I would a text\nmessage even though it’s hours and hours between you checking. You make working together impossible but I’m hopeful we can figure it out. Please\njust afford me what you would expect me to afford you. I want to work with you. Let’s please don’t create unnecessary drama.\nThanks!\nSent:01/19/2024 at 07:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 10:42 PM)\nSubject:Remotes\nAttachments:IMG_0960.PNG (700 KB)\nMessage 581 of 4024\nHey- sorry, did not see this. We went from coordinating the move and fixing Xfinity in real time all day like champs. But once you dropped off it was\nlike a black hole.\nWe did discuss the remotes. In text and over the phone several times. I said the bed won’t work, and told you the TV one was white and had a green or\nblue rubber cover.\nIf we did not discuss it why did you bring some of the things we did not discuss and put them on my car? We think alike, but that’s a stretch to think\nyou came up with that by yourself.\nEither way. It was great working with you today. We got a ton done. And even with all the Xfinity mix ups I was able to get it fixed. Please do check to\nbe sure you like what I did.\nI was even able to get you Diamond Status for your new account  But most importantly,\nI want you to be totally clear and happy with your access and security.\nLet me know if you have any questions!\nSent:01/19/2024 at 08:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 10:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Heading Over",
