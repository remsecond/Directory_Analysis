Since we swap I’ll take a stab at the odd year.\nChristine:\n- All of December break\n- Luxury trip to Cali and Universal Studios\n- Christmas Eve with Rudolph’s\n- Xmas morning with never noted gifts\nRobert:\n- Encore Xmas morning\nI’ll figure out to ask “just the right question” someday. Because I clearly noted that the kids Xmas should start much earlier. That is important to\nthem. I’m their Dad, I know that. So I’m glad that you could swoop in and do it for them at least. I’ll be ready for Act II.\nMessage 40 of 4024\nAgree we are going through first year adjustment. From my perspective it’s been really difficult managing your out bursts and emotional needs. From\nthe texts to email you sent last night to constant communication on this forum. Expectation I’m on my a game all the time after the barrage I receive\nfrom you is tough. I’m just not able to do that anymore\nSent:12/25/2023 at 07:59 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 07:59 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas\nMessage 41 of 4024\nIt’s not a question of being “on your game”\nThis is actually just a question of your honesty. Same as the email. You are never honest. From the kids, to telling me about “us”, to your relationship\nwith Kevin Ortega at work, to the hidden collusion with Yurushka, to the Cali trip on the cheap, to our Xmas morning plans. It never ends I I know\nthat.\nThe platform won’t matter if you are always dishonest. They say lying is hard because you always have to remember what you said. You can make it\neasier on both of us by being honest. Then there are zero messages to try and figure out the truth. Can we just start there and see how it goes?\nI’m game if you just start telling the truth.\nI can do it starting right now, I assure you!\nSent:12/25/2023 at 08:06 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas\nMessage 42 of 4024\nI REALLY miss you being a part of this. We are having a blast and the gifts and hunt were a hit. But it’s their parents that are never going to change.\nSo we should show them we can work through our adult issues and still love them enough to share events. I will do whatever it takes to stop our\nacrimony now that we have a plan. I want to work with you, as a team.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 09:51 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 10:35 AM)\nSubject:Alyssa Model",
