I felt like I tried. But you just quit, even though we had committed plans together....\nOh wait... getting a case of Deja vu of my marriage to you... trusting you would follow through ...\ntoo easy?   probably... lol\nSent:01/20/2024 at 11:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 08:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: I’ll check OFW so no misunderstandings\nMessage 595 of 4024\nIs it even worth trying to get sorted? We have move, Alki, Dr Brown... and whatever else, all with hard deadlines and you going out of town next\nweek.\nFrankly I’m tired of trying with you. I was going to suggest starting the day off right like yesterday, but that honestly went nowhere and was a huge\nwaste.\nI don’t want to fight, and I’m tired of this bullshit OFW where you log in every 8 hours and then complain my stuff is at the house while you no show\nat Alki.\nThe hardest part I guess is even if we make rock solid plans you just fuck it up and then complain. Then threaten me to mail my shit or move to\nstorage.\nFriday we had four bedroom pieces to move. They only moved one, and it was busted. They acted on your direction and moved a ton of junk instead.\nThen you fuck up the whole Xfinity thing before acting like we did not have remote exchange plans. Meanwhile I ordered yours before you even\nasked.\nI wanted to write a nice email and suggest working together. It’s just not possible with you. You won’t communicate or stand by set plans.\nYou are such a huge fucking time waster. I really, really hope you’re happy with your decision to blow up the Moyer’s instead of being honest, because\nthis sucks.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 01:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 08:12 AM)\nSubject:Today",
