I thought based on your guidance, that you would check OFW before you head out for your night.\nBut you quit checking this afternoon and now it’s passed 8:00. So not really helpful to have you check at this point since it’s past our cutoff.\nIs that what you had in mind? I want to work with ya!\nHave a fun night out!\nSent:12/29/2023 at 08:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/29/2023 at 09:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Comms Guidelines\nMessage 134 of 4024\nYou are clearly using this platform in a way that it was not intended. Nothing you send is urgent nor does it need an immediate response but a\ndisguised attempt to get me to engage.\nI do not interfere with your time nor should you with mine. The inference below “before you head out for your night” is inflammatory and it against\nguidelines that my private life is my private life as is yours.\nWe are aligned on phase 1 so no need to accelerate discussions. Frankly I agree with Dr Brown and we cease verbal communication and we need to\nadjust communication on this platform as well.\nThe three emails you sent clearly escalate in tone and none require immediate response.\nI’ll confer with my lawyer on Tuesday on suggestions for modifications but this clearly is not working and does not prevent you from behavior that is\ncontrolling and triggering.\nAdrian will be dropped off at 9am.\nSent:12/29/2023 at 09:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/29/2023 at 09:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Comms Guidelines\nMessage 135 of 4024\nWhat the heck is that? I am not doing anything wrong and I did not expect a response. You are trying to make me look and feel bad. That was not my\nintention at all. You read something into everything I say. Just like you thought I was stalking you on here. But I am getting an alert. It just wrong.\nPlease take a step back and work with me. I’m trying to partner please. I am not trying to dig at you.\nSent:12/29/2023 at 09:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/30/2023 at 08:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Your Comms Guidelines",
