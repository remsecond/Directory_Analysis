I have tried to get a head start on a possible next LUGG move on Monday per your request. I have included the items you noted yesterday and\nreplied with an update to our \"Dad on the Eastside\" email.\nI want to be sensitive to your platform asks but feel like the email format is going to serve us better for the fine tuning so have sent a much more\nlegible version to your Hotmail. For your records and consistency.\nI am also copying and pasting the same content here, but it will not be easy to track or understand inline comments. Frankly, it is a mess so I hope we\ncan use both platforms appropriately. Thanks!\n------------------------Start of email------------------------------------------------\nThere is a lot of stuff here. I don't think it will all make it. If you can look through this list. Let me know what you think. If we agree, I can distill it\ninto one manageable, prioritized list to share and agree to. I appreciate the help and cooperation. Getting our homes and stuff untangled will go a long\nway. Thanks!    From You:  \"Big items are peloton, your bike, inversion, grill, green egg. Let me know if anything else See below. I have gathered\nclothes, ski gear, some electronics, art, decor, miscellaneous household items in front room so it should be an easy load up. Sounds good. Please don't\nsend junk stuff though. Let's just wait till mediation and when we need to make big decisions on our final places when we need to swedish clean and\nput stuff in storage...\nOriginal \"Split List\" TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).OK You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd\nlike to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in your sitting room.Furniture: I will move our sitting\nroom and guest room stuff to new place.I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may\nprefer that from a measurement perspective. OK for guest room I am using beach stuff so we don;t need to buy anything. If you would prefer it I am\nopen to swapping and renting but it's your call. Patio: We agree it's not used, so I will take, but we can truly divide in mediation.OK They did not\nhave room for the crows nest stuff. I'd like to finish that part of the move.Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.You\ncan take all the grills. I will not use them. Does this include the green egg? If not, I can arrange for the dump. Sounds good. We can move those over.\nNote there is a smoker that is under the hot tub mailbox as well.  Misc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?\nCan take bean bag from man cave, Pelloton, Stair Master, desk all from Man Cave. I have nice Crate and Barrel art pieces that are not hanging up that\nyou can take a look at and decide. You can also take the Moose in living room, cows head on porch. From this list I would say we move any pieces that\nyou feel like sharing, the cow's head, I can take the bean bag if you want me to but I want a black cover so may need to order? Let's sell the Peleton. I\nassume Max will need the stairmaster.  Kitchen: Realistic division of shared assets, I think you are working on that.Do you want the Crate and Barrel\nyellow plateware set? I pulled out the SBUX set that I bought 10 plus years ago, and have started to use that. LMK if you want the whiteporcelain set\nthat was on wedding registry. Its barely used. and the plateware Christmas set from your mom. Just LMK. Let's wait for medition to start divying up\nmore of the plateware. I am fine for now.  Decorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.OK Love to still do this.\nMy place is bleak. I could really use your help as we discussed. Linens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?\nBoth households could use a refresh. Let's do this. I am happy to let you decide and just dupe. I am happy to order us the sheets that we used at the\nbeach that are so soft on the skin.  Other furniture for consideration\nMaster bedroom: I can use beach stuff as a temp option. We swap the mattresses.AgreeI think we are going to swap these at a later date. I don't want\nSent:01/14/2024 at 07:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 07:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",
