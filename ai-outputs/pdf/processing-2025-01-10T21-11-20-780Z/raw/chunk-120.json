  "text": "You are responsible for your decisions and choices.\nMessage 433 of 4024\nYou met with my Lawyer at close of business on a holiday weekend. I have spent that holiday trying to piece together your ask. You act like both of\nour lawyers are sitting around waiting on me when you know that is not the case. Does yours carry a beeper over the holiday to hear what I have to say\nin response to an undelivered ask?\nYou act like the physics of this situation are so cut and dry when you know the truth. And you know I have tried all weekend to figure out what you\nare asking. And then today (the 5th day as you like to say) you send me a list and start talking about some top secret sliding scale that I should have\ncomplied with as you tell me how horrible my attorney is.\nI can’t do anymore and you are acting like I’m sitting on my hands. It’s simply not true and you know that.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 08:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 06:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter\nMessage 434 of 4024\nYour tone and attitude towards me is appalling given I’m the one that was so violently violated.\nDay 6 and we are still living in fear.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 06:16 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 08:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter\nMessage 435 of 4024\nI’m just frustrated with the whole situation Christine.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 08:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 08:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter\nMessage 436 of 4024\nYou should be embarrassed apologetic and doing everything in your power to correct and make it right moving forward.\nYou being frustrated is incredible given your actions.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 08:42 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 08:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter",
