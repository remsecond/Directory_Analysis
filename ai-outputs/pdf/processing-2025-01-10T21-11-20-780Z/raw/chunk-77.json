No need to set up a couch move.\nOr\nYes to set up another move to get it to the garage?\nI’ll spend some time mapping out all the details as I understand. And the logistics to tonight. Then we can go over it together. Then we can decide if\nwe want to fill holes with CL or Fernish or whatever we find.\nThen we can say “let’s both budget $ for mutual xyz and stay in each other’s ball park. Example: Sitting Room- Mine will double as an office. But I’m\nnot going to dupe yours now. That would be nuts.\nOr... if we see something we love and must have that is beyond a shared budget, then perhaps we tell each other and say “ok, get whatever you want,\nbut it’s your 50/50 later”. But that is earmarked as a spend.\nI don’t think either of us would do that without knowing if the next 20 years we are both living in  separate but duplicate lives in our own 1.3k square\nfoot apartment. But we may. This is tough for sure.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 04:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 05:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: LUGGs\nMessage 275 of 4024\nAssuming you have this covered.\nI’d prefer to be “first right of refusal”\nas Dr Brown advises when you can’t make something.\nDefinitely not in any way whatsoever trying to start a fight or disagreement discussion.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 05:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 05:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 276 of 4024\nYes.
