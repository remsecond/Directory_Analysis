The giggles and jokes in the elevator seem like yesterday. I honestly thought we had battled back. To a\nplace of kindness and cooperation. Where we understood the finality of our situation as we emptied out the place where we shared so much. But we\nwere going to be kind, share grace. And work together to do the right thing, and make smart decisions. That is why I texted you my high hopes for a\nnew start.\nIs there any possible way, any way at all that we can take one day and just let this rest? Stop the fighting, lay down our arms, and maybe not find\nkindness, but at least find civility. There are so many hurt feelings for opportunities lost. But may we please pause for just a moment and take some\ntime before we make permanent decisions. If you will please, I would love to stand down and resume on Sunday\nSent:01/25/2024 at 11:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 07:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 806 of 4024\nI am seeking civility as well. Guardrails were out in place after serious boundaries were crossed repeatedly.\nI am discussing your proposal for how we work with Dr Brown with my lawyer later today and will respond in kind.\nPlease let me know if Xfinity alerts continue for you.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 07:22 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 07:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!",
