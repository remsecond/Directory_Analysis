I want to be sensitive to that. You have made a request of me of what not to\nmention. I will comply. But I hope we don’t digress given our POVs and history.\nI am happy to explore spaces like that under the watchful eye of a professional and welcome that. But till then I’d like to steer clear and be respectful\nof things that might give you anxiety or cause you to feel triggered. I’m trying here.\nYou are working. I realize this is the exact kind of thing we are trying to avoid, so am not looking for anything else from you so you can focus and be\nsuccessful.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 11:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 12:12 PM)\nSubject:Triggers\nMessage 214 of 4024\nI mentioned that I have a physical card as well in email. I don’t know if that makes things easier to pay bills, but it works like a normal Visa as far as I\ncan tell so theoretically it should. Attaching relevant info.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 11:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 12:12 PM)\nSubject:Unemployment: ReliaCard (Not Urgent)\nAttachments:IMG_0758.jpg (5 MB)\nIMG_0759.jpg (5 MB)\nMessage 215 of 4024\nKirkland House Stop:\n- Grabbed two BofA checks. Check #’s attached for tracking.\n- I have Adrian’s laptop, power, and mouse. I think we are good.\n- I brought your Amazon stuff back and put it on the foyer table.\nAt some point (hopefully soon) we will be good enough so something as dumb as this does not need a mail. But doing it now so you know I will not\nbe near the house and you. So hopefully limited anxiety today.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 01:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 02:00 PM)\nSubject:Home Visit: Not Urgent",
