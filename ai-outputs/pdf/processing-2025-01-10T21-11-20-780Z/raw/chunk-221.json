  "text": "Message 807 of 4024\nI’ve been thinking about this. You made me sign something that says I am a risk to physically beat you or the kids. My queen, my soulmate. My\nchildren. This seems beyond my wildest, worst nightmare. I don’t want to live in a world where I have to sign something like that to stay out of jail. I’\nm honestly so lost I don’t know where to begin. It’s all so horrible...\nSent:01/26/2024 at 07:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 808 of 4024\nWhen have I ever beat you or my children? That’s what it says. Can we please take that part out? I would  end my own life before I beat you or my\nchildren. I spent 29 years dreaming of forever with our crew. I would never beat you or the kids. Do we have to say that I’m going to beat you or Max\nand Adrian? It’s so heartbreaking  I can’t stand it.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 07:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 809 of 4024\nShow me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers.\nMax home from school today. Lisa has it covered once I leave.\nHave you emailed SAAS re Adrian or plan to? If not I will reach out to Jonathan.\nI will complete the the enrollment paperwork for Max which is due soon.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 08:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 08:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 810 of 4024\nAs mentioned, having Elsa over yesterday was a great help. We made progress unpacking and organizing things. Small progress.\nThat said, the most important thing was when she was watching me tear the place apart holding my SoberLink case and said “oh, if you need that, I\npacked it at the beach. It’s in the black Thule case”\nThis is the gift from you of course. The problem is, I have not located that Thule case in the tens of boxes and bags I have in the place. It’s really\nharder than you might imagine.\nI’ll stop everything this AM and just focus on finding that. She was just trying to help, and it is not her fault, it’s mine. I bring it everywhere, and felt\nlike it was important to have when we saw each other.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 08:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:17 AM)\nSubject:SoberLink\nAttachments:IMG_1066.PNG (274 KB)",
