  "text": "Message 552 of 4024\nSo I am getting alarms fired. Whatever is going on has locked me out of my Xfinity account. So you have all the power for all accounts it seems. Before\nat least we shared access to our data and account. Now only you can see mine. As I’ve mentioned every day since this began, I’d love to show you how\nto do this like I helped get your laptop on WiFi. But I’m locked out now and beholding to your mercy and grace to see my own account. Sheesh\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 553 of 4024\nThey made it clear to me the alki and Bellevue accounts were under your name only and I do not have access.

That sounds like what you should have done. That said, I’m still locked out now based on the changes you\nhave made our Xfinty account. Since you did it, would you please mind “undiding it” so I have access to my account, you have access to yours and we\nlive happily ever after. I really wish you would let me help,but you do you. How’s my usage data look?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 556 of 4024\nDid you try calling them? 1 888 936 4968\nI do t see those accounts on my end.
