I’ll put on the console table and you can grab when you drop off Adrian.\nNow that you have an address, I assume you will have packages mailed directly to the Bellevue address.\niRS refund check arrived for 11k. I will deposit in the joint BofA account.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 06:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 06:51 PM)\nSubject:Packages/Mail/IRS refund check\nMessage 316 of 4024\nSuper.
