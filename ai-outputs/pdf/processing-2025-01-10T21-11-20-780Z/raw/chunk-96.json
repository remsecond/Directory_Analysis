It’s unfucking cool to make me a\ndick on all those counts trying to please you.\nMessage 340 of 4024\nConfirming you will pick up Adrian from school today at 1:15pm and drop off at 8:30pm\nI discussed with Adrian regarding school options for sixth grade. He is comfortable with us exploring SAAS as an option especially if he does not need\nto go through the application process again as he was previously admitted. If we go for seventh grade he will need to do that again and will be part of\nlate application process/waitlist.\nSent:01/10/2024 at 07:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/10/2024 at 10:09 AM)\nSubject:Adrian\nMessage 341 of 4024\nReminder coding is at 3:30.
