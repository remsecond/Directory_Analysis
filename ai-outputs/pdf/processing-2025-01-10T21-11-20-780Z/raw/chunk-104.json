  "text": "Message 371 of 4024\nDay of is too late to arrange for a Lugg. I would be happy to bring your TV over to swap. And grab the computer stuff that I need. It is packed.\nI’d really like to see Adrian today if possible. I am hoping that we do not let our personal conflicts impact them more than we have already.\nSince you are out for the night it seems like a reasonable ask\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 372 of 4024\nThis is personal to boys and I.\nAdrian was very much impacted by what you did and has expressed serious concern for his safety, legality of what happened and fear.\nNo on tv swap or you coming to Kirkland residence.\nI am not out for the night but unavailable for coordination of Lugg. My movements are not your business.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:30 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 373 of 4024\nYou told me your movement. I just responded.\nI don’t know what you are telling AD or how he is involved, but I would recommend that we keep our business between us and not involve the kids.\nIf Adrian has any concerns they should not come through you. I am more than happy to address with him directly or with you there. As I have asked\nto do for months now, but you have refused. But acting as the gatekeeper for conversations about me to the kids as you have done since July when\nyou told Max that you all were divorcing me does not seem appropriate or helpful.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 374 of 4024\nAdrian was the one who alerted me to the monitoring. He expressed serious concern and was very alarmed.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:36 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today",
