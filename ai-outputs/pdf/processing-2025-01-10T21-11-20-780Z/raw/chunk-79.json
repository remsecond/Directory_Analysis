  "text": "me focus on a high-paying job and make great investment choices in the market and real estate. But in a community asset state, the 50/50 model\ndoesn't change even when our roles are reversed. So your current earnings, my payout, and my unemployment benefits are just part of our marital\nestate. So if we are currently drawing from our joint income and investments to pay our bills, why would it be viewed as drawing solely from your\nearnings? Till we divvy everything up, everything is still the same, right? It's just you have been contributing more these last few months. The same\nway I did for the last 24 years is the way that I interpret what is going on now.\nDefinitely not trying to argue. It's just how I interpret community property until we go our own way after the divorce. And as I mentioned today, I\nreally hope we learn to be civil enough to effectively partner with financial professionals to make the best long-term decisions as a team (we both have\na good head on our shoulders). Especially when it comes to things like \"when to sell what\" wrt stock to pay the least amount of taxes as our brackets\nevolve and change. Of course, the same goes for the house and condo sale. Given the interest rate hell we are going to be dealing with, essentially\nforgoing all that we tried to do, we may not be able to reasonably buy homes for years to come. Divorces are utterly devastating to retirement plans\nalong with future quality of life, given the self-inflicted opportunity costs.\nLet's get our animosity in order and put our thinking caps on!!!!\nMessage 280 of 4024\nI think we agreed I would give him a ride home. So I am planning on it.\nIâ€™d like to grab the other chair and maybe a bag or two as well.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 06:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 06:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 281 of 4024\nThank you for bringing him home.
