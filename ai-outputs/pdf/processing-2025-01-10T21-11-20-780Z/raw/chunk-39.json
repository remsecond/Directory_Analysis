Great working with you!\nJust think, in the future we can be in court all the time telling us what day Christmas is, and if New Year’s Day is recognized as a holiday in the United\nStates. Because between us, we both have different interpretations on those. Can’t wait!\nSent:12/31/2023 at 03:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/31/2023 at 03:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD drop off\nMessage 143 of 4024\nHoping you can find the cycles for this soon.

For everything. If you can’t make time to have a talk about our child given the way he has responded to this situation\nforget it. If you really don’t see a problem here that we urgently need professional help with I don’t know what to do.\nYour way has not worked since Yurushaka when we promised to talk about discernment. Please recognize history for a moment and consider if we\nhave a problem we should address constructively. We used to work together even after this started. It worked.\nThen you started shutting down our efforts. Stopping any help to understand the other’s perspective, or heal. Creating a destructive self fulfilling\nprophecy of disaster. It’s not working. It’s getting worse. Please consider working with me before the courts make us.\nToday this all started when I tried to do you a favor. Then another. Then you insult me and start a fight. I’m sure I do that crap as well to you. But we\nshould learn how to step back, own our own self-determination. And stop. But we really need help to do that.\nI was dark all weekend so this would not happen. But we will have to talk sometime. Like we should for Max’s mental health. This is a very high stakes\ngame. Let’s please treat it with the care and respect it deserves. So we can talk about our kids mental health.\nI’m really trying. Just tell me your terms even. I’ll likely do anything to be better parents because the status quo is not working. It’s really not a win if\nSent:12/31/2023 at 04:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/31/2023 at 04:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)",
