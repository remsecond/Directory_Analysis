She still needs to align what she wants to do.\nKids... going to await your response after you discuss with lawyer and see your response. I did not create this situation but had to respond with only\noption I had to protect me and kids.\nHoliday weekend. This will change after you discuss with lawyer. Plan is to stay with me.\nSent:01/12/2024 at 02:30 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 02:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Are we just dead in the Water?",
