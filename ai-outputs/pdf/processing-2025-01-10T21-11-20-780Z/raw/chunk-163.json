  "text": "I’d like to work with you before this escalates as I need my things, want to see my kids, and get out of Alki. Please let me know how we can proceed.\nThe clock is ticking fast.\nI’ll be underground again soon because I haven’t had a way to change in the 7 months since you took everything. Forcing me underground or in the\nshadow of your office. So sick.\nWe agreed yesterday to use text to communicate while we are trying to make progress on this topic yesterday. If you can find it in you to stick to a\ncommitment, please ping me.\nThanks!\nMessage 599 of 4024\n.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 01:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 01:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress II\nAttachments:IMG_0992.PNG (762 KB)\nMessage 600 of 4024\nI am on a mountain Robert and you know that. Going to start driving.\nWorking with you when you continue the language and abuse is not working. I am happy to work directly through the attorneys for my own safety.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 02:00 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 02:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress II\nMessage 601 of 4024\nSafety... that’s rich.\nI’m offering to work with you. I’m just asking you to 1) stop poking me 2) be dependable and reliable 3) quit making excuses for situations of your\nown making.\nPlease unblock in about 45 minutes. We can at least touch base and try to get on the same page. Working through attorneys won’t work. Sure yours\nexplained.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 02:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 03:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress II\nMessage 602 of 4024\nI’m back in the daylight!!\nSent:01/21/2024 at 03:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 03:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress II",
