I went ahead and sent a message but not sure that will get us anywhere.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 01:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is 9:00 too late?\nMessage 21 of 4024\nOk they said 8:30. I don’t think this is supposed to require immediate responses and we should set expectations like Dr. Brown protocol. I understand\nneed for this but wanted to set expectations moving g forward.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 01:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 01:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is 9:00 too late?\nMessage 22 of 4024\nI don’t need the lecture on etiquette. I understand how we are supposed to use it. But we were in the middle of a back and forth to get the kids time\nright. You bailed even though we agreed we needed to solve it. So I understand the difference and hope you do too. Can we please just practice the\ngolden rule? That seems like the best framework for us.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 01:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 01:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is 9:00 too late?\nMessage 23 of 4024\nOk. I will drop off at 8:30am. See you tomorrow.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 01:13 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 01:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is 9:00 too late?\nMessage 24 of 4024\nOk. I can also come get them, but if you drop them off can you bring my Santa Hat?
