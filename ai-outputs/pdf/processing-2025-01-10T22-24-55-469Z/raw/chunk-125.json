We have been ignoring our entire divorce and now we have this. I’d like to compare notes so we keep him out of\nadult situations without me appearing I don’t give a crap.\nThanks!\nSent:01/16/2024 at 05:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 06:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball/packages\nMessage 457 of 4024\nFor my stuff. Very helpful. And it was awesome seeing AD. At the end we were on the same team for full court 5-5. I never realized what an amazing\nfeeling that would be, or even thought about a scenario where it would be possible. We just don’t skip a beat and can always pick up right where we\nleft off.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 09:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 05:22 AM)\nSubject:Thanks\nMessage 458 of 4024\nChristine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of\nyour personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to assure you that my intention was never to monitor you or the boys in a way that would\ncompromise your privacy. I acknowledge your concerns, and in light of those, believe it would be best for us to separate any shared services, such as\nATT and Xfinity, where activity information is accessible to both of us. This will ensure you feel comfortable and secure, knowing that you are not\nunder any form of surveillance. Every account we have is shared today, so you are of course free to examine anything you’d like.\nRegarding your concerns about cameras and electronic monitoring, the Blink cameras at the front door and garage door were installed when we both\nlived in the home. They are plainly visible and serve as deterrents to potential intruders, similar to our security signs. These are the only cameras in\nplace. To explain what happened, I believe when the movers were there Tuesday with all the doors open, the wifi connection to the Blink cameras\nrefreshed.  The cameras have not worked in the past because they are too far from our wifi.  But with a clear line of sight and wifi signal, it allowed the\ncamera(s) to reconnect unexpectedly. But I can confirm I never watched a livestream. I opened an alert when it fired, reviewed move pictures of the\nhouse taken Tuesday, and various other apps and photostories (at different times) when Adrian was visiting Wednesday. I did not know he had any\nconcerns at the time, but would have addressed them immediately if I had.\nI am sorry my actions invaded your privacy. This won't happen again. There are no audio or video surveillance devices inside or outside the Kirkland\nSent:01/17/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 07:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",
