  "text": "Message 617 of 4024\nMy last message was about peaceful collaboration in support of the idea you communicated. I actually did everything you asked.\nNow I’m trying to forward you some important texts involving the coms I am having on next steps with some of our work streams.\nBut you block me anyway. The day after you told me to read what OFE was for- “documenting evidence to send to your attorney.”\nYou don’t problem solve. You intentionally obstruct progress to elicit a response that suits your legal\nstrategy to destroy me.\nI’m almost 99% sure, that is neither the reason Dr Brown suggested OFW or the true intent of a safe collaboration platform.\nIs this sufficient for the sake of your documentation?\nLet me know if you want to really start collaborating\nSent:01/22/2024 at 09:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 09:24 AM)\nSubject:You blocked me again?\nMessage 618 of 4024\nI would like all communication on OFW.\nThis platform documents everything and is easy to pull records if needed and can be accessed by legal if needed. That is clearly stated on the sign up\nand why this is recommended by courts and lawyers.\nTexts are out of hand. My mental health is much improved by not having unwanted texts come in at all hours.\nI will unblock for certain periods to manage immediate items but my default will be to block.\nI sent two emails earlier.\nOne for Ad and one for Alki. I will monitor during the day for response.\nAs discussed I will also communicate to my lawyer to send over to your lawyer the asks on the surveillance that I previously shared with you and asked\nthat be returned via your lawyer.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 09:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 09:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: You blocked me again?\nMessage 619 of 4024\nLet me know when I am unblocked so we can make progress. A buffet of issues in a single OFW message so you can send to your attorney isn’t\nhelpful or productive to me.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 09:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 09:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: You blocked me again?",
