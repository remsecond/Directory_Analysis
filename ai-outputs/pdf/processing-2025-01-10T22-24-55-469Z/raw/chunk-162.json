  "text": "Message 596 of 4024\nPlease stop these emails.\nI have requested you stop on many instances.\nThey are unwanted and are harassing in nature.\nThey are very scary and frightening and progressively become more aggressive in tone.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 10:49 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 10:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress\nMessage 597 of 4024\nSo... we agree we are both escalating. If I read correctly, you started it, telling me I’m an abuser and began the 25 years of terror discussion, not me.\nYour mo even when we in good times is that you say crazy stuff, are incredibly mean, and expect me not to reply.\nI will find that to be challenging. Reflecting on the Golden Rule, you do unto others as you would have done to yourself. So don’t do it to me, and I’ll\nbe better about not doing what you just did to me back. Does that sound like a good plan? I can do it.\nI’ll also struggle if you continue to lie about your lies.\nIt’s too much. You stood with me on a dirt path at Tumblecreek swearing to me, that what I am able to send to you never happened. It did. I have\npictures to prove it did. And you still deny it. Did HR see those?\nYour dishonesty and deceit is undeniable. Yet you stand on a platform of an utterly false reality you created and preach, ruin my entire life, take my\nqueen, kids, home, money, and livelihood. All while you proactively destroy my reputation with friends.\nPerhaps in your haste to ask me to reflect, as they say “physician, heal thyself”. Take a moment to examine your deeds. We should be strolling the\nfarmers market, holding hands, buying shrooms and pasta and dreaming the dreams of an honest married couple.\nYour insistence on a false reality to justify your demonstrably narrcisitc and Moyer family destructive behavior and abuse is scary and frightening to\nme. Please stop\nSent:01/21/2024 at 11:06 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 12:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress\nMessage 598 of 4024\nYou are totally dark.  You refuse to cooperate or coordinate any of the big areas we need to make progress on. I won’t repeat that list of hi-pri areas.\nYou are as aware as I am.\nWe have had the entire weekend. Two days you had no work. The only real com we have had was f2f at ADs game when you told me that you were\nnot going to do what we agreed to.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 01:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 01:58 PM)\nSubject:Zero Progress II",
