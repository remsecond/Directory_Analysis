  "text": "Message 673 of 4024\nTo be polite or constructive, and only insist on your power play games to the detriment of accomplishing anything productive at all or fostering a civil\nrelationship, here is what I sent. Note I immediately said let’s move it back to OFW to respect your wishes. But it was too late. You blocked me\nwithout notice and went 10 hours between OFW checks even after we had an emergency yesterday. Then blasted me with a variety of unsorted\nmessages saying things that I did not say. I really don’t get you but I do help you get the help you need. Your style is so helpful and productive!\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 10:24 AM)\nSubject:Since you could not bother\nAttachments:IMG_1016_1.PNG (784 KB)",
