In the future it might be easier just to answear a simple question than to start making assumptions and making demands.\nAny chance we can actually agree to read each other’s question and see if we can just answer it first next time? I think that was Dr Browns suggestion\ntoday as well. Behaving the exact same way, just on another platform won’t really buy us much. Let’s make this work together!\nThanks!\nSent:12/23/2023 at 10:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 02:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Done using this\nMessage 6 of 4024\n“Let’s regroup tomorrow after Dr brown meeting. Any discussion today would be premature without her input on Max”\nWe have put our discussion off for quite a while now. Including our running list. You pushed it till after yesterday so let me know when you want to\nhave it.\nIt won’t be f2f and we should both be in a space we can be kind and willing to show grace. We finally have something in place so hope that helps us\nout.\nJust let me know. Wishing you the best.\nSent:12/24/2023 at 04:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 07:20 AM)\nSubject:Regroup as Discussed\nMessage 7 of 4024\nShould we do 26?\nSent:12/24/2023 at 07:22 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Regroup as Discussed\nMessage 8 of 4024\nSounds perfectly to me.
