  "text": "Message 289 of 4024\nSomehow, we turned a corner tonight and worked together. We even did a holiday swap on the fly that worked for us both! It was super refreshing.\nI hope we keep it up. This week will be super crazy for me. I'll get as much done as I can but will really need help getting us out of the beach next\nweek.\nWe also agree that we need to have a conversation before the kids start seeing all this stuff disappearing to \"Dad's place\".  Let's think about that asap.\nI'm telling you because you will be in work mode soon, so I just want this on your radar. I'll do my damn best this week, but please budget time for\nthis soon.\nthanks!\nSent:01/07/2024 at 10:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 07:15 AM)\nSubject:This Week\nMessage 290 of 4024\nSounds like a plan.\nWednesday what time do you want coding for Adrian?\nSent:01/08/2024 at 07:16 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 07:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 291 of 4024\nSuper, thanks. I need to figure out where to get boxes. I’ll start with U-Haul and we can reuse.\nFor coding, I’d vote for his regular slot so we maintain a regular routine. Predictably is important.\nHave a great work week. Please let me know if I can help in any way. I’ll just tell ya if I can’t help.\nP.S. Just remembered the National Championship is tonight. AD will want to watch w/ me. Your call!\nSent:01/08/2024 at 07:45 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 07:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 292 of 4024\nShould we just swap bedroom sets with mattresses?\nKirkland set has dresser which has all your items, and deep mattresses fits bed frame. I’m fine either way.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 07:48 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 07:49 AM)\nSubject:Bedroom set",
