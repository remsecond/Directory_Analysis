  "text": "Message 815 of 4024\nI have a lot of questions and concerns about some of the content below and the moves I am making that you may not be aware of. I also have some\nthings that you should have that impact things like our taxes. I would not want to violate the RO however.\nI just don't know how this will work without at least a little planning and logistics coordination. I feel we will stumble over each other and may end\nup using something that the other has plans for. Or one of us may be unaware the other has a pipeline move waiting to execute.\nAnyway, as mentioned, you guys know Lisa is gone for the next two weeks and has several additional dates on the calendar for out-of-state trials and\nother engagements. I'm looking at our numbers and am afraid we are going to crash and burn without coordination.\nEven if we had some sort of approved \"running list\" meeting with strict ground rules it would go a long way. I am trying to assure you that I will be on\nmy Monday behavior (and would have continued if I was not blackballed Monday PM) But this is the last time I'll say this.\nFingers crossed because I'm making moves, and I am sure you are too. I feel we are flying without a net and unless my subject line is always \"Our Kids\nInheritance\" as a way to address, we are taking an enormous risk to our fiscal viability before mediation.\nI'm in your hands. Have a great day. I'm out!\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 12:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 816 of 4024\nThank you for the note. Agree the whole thing is frustrating especially around financial aspects.\nI didn’t see a confirmation on xfinity alerts that would be helpful so I know what you continue to have visibility to but I can address through lawyers\nif you will not share.\nLet me think about periodic connects to align that don’t violate the RO on either side.\nMax has a cold as do many of his classmates.\nI’ll send Jonathan and email as I didn’t see a response in that piece either.\nLooking forward to a more civil and cooperative relationship and tone in our communications.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:31 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 12:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 817 of 4024\nI have not seen one today. Thank you. If I see anything at all on any platform, I’ll let you know.\nI hope we find a solution. The worse that can happen is we go broke and our kids hate us.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 01:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>",
