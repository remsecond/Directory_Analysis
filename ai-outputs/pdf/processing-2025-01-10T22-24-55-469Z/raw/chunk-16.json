And how on earth am I threatening you. Please stop this now. You are\nclearly planting words to suit a narrative of your own creation. I am asking for honesty. That is it. If you can’t do that, ok. It just changes how we\nwork together. But I am clearly not doing anything more than to say let’s do what we discussed today. And just be honest.\nCan we please stop like I asked earlier. I did not want to fight. So let’s move forward. Please\nSent:12/26/2023 at 09:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 06:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Moving Forward\nMessage 70 of 4024\nAfter thinking about this more, I realize that you were\nprobably trying to avoid a potential fight. You came and got AD, took him home, and then left for the day. Hence the long delay getting back to me\nabout swinging his Xbox over. You were not there.\nI get our history might have lead to a conflict. But, we have a plan now. Me micromanaging what you do with your time is not permitted. I can\nsympathize with why you would think I would complain, but I assure you that I am not going to do that. It is your time.\nIf I give you grief moving forward, please let me know immediately. I will course correct. I honestly was only bothered that you were not being\ntruthful about your explanation for ending the conversation.\nI really am committed to the plan.\nLet’s work together please!\nSent:12/26/2023 at 11:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 06:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Moving Forward\nMessage 71 of 4024\nGood Morning!\nHope you are well. Mind letting me know when Is good to see AD? I’ll also ask Max if he would like to have dinner in a public place. I hope both are\nconsistent with our plan and follow up discussion.\nYou have nothing but my complete partnership today I assure you! I suggest that we also finalize as many details we can off the bat (example: drop off\ntime?) so we do not have to be on here today at all. Agree?\nYou have a hard job and I want to respect that 100%\nThanks Again!\nrobert\nSent:12/27/2023 at 07:46 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 07:52 AM)\nSubject:Wed & Holiday Time",
