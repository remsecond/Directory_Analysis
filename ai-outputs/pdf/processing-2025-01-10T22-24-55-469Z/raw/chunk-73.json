I’ll do my best and communicate with him.\nI have LUGGs lined up for this week Mon-Wed to start uncoupling. My plan is to move consistent with our shared email.\nThere may still some fine tuning (example: I think Max uses the stair master to train)  but I’ll stick to the confirmed items. It will likely be a couple of\nweeks to complete but it’s a start.\nI hope that you are pleased I negotiated a 9 month lease. Very few places will do that but I made it clear that was the reason this place was even in\nconsideration.\nSo while it may bother you, I am tried my best and it’s a competitive rent in this market. And it’s near you, a SAAS bustop, and the kids should\napprove of the space.\nI’d also like to make some purchase descriptions today. (Example: ScanPan, Linens, Towels, organizing stuff- Kitchen and closet, etc...) I think we\nagreed for some of these we both need a refresh. In other cases we can either split, or purchase new and have two separate sets. I am happy and would\nprefer collaboration.\nI am trying to work constructively with you to extricate myself from any area of your life that is not necessary. Every cross word about who is doing\nwhat on a Eastside place is likely washed breath. It will be resolved by someone else in the future. So let’s just start trying to work together in a positive\nway with a shared goal.\nPlease do reply. It’s so hard to communicate sometimes and you have called it out as well. I’m not debating the platforms right now. I’m talking about\nthis message and this topic on OFW.\nThanks\nSent:01/07/2024 at 12:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 01:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 265 of 4024\nOk... crazy morning trying to get out so I’m running just a bit behind. At a minimum I’ll get the air filter installed before you gate back. Assuming if\nit’s done at 3:00 I have till 3:45.\nIf I need to do the wave during one of the LUGG visits this week I can do that too. I want to get it done but also respect your space.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 02:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 03:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Microwave",
