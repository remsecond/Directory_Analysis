  "text": "Message 674 of 4024\nSo.... To confirm, as I called you out (like I am off to do when you don’t tell the truth on critical matters of our family’s destruction) you can NOT\nstand by your assertion below? You always have a reason, or explanation when we know you are being dishonest.\nWith Yurushka it was, “we are not doing that” till I showed you a digital footprint that what I was saying was true and you were being dishonest.\nThen your story evolved’ let’s say to accommodate the truth; and you said your dishonesty was actually justified.\nI can go on.. KO,  Xmas, vacations, telling our close friends I’m an abuser. Honestly (if you know what that means) if we just start being truthful it\nwill save us about 80% of the time we waste talking to each other.\nLet’s just do that!\n- Start being honest with me\n- Don’t say things you can’t prove\n- Stick to the truth and move forward\nThen there is zero need to hang up like you do every time I call BS on your fake reality. No need to record or have someone eavesdrop either. Let’s do\nit!\nP.S. again... i didn’t say what you are depicting below wrt Dr Brown. I asked for proof. You have none.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 10:07 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 10:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 675 of 4024\nPutting it on OFW. I would like to see AD as is my legal right, tomorrow. We share custody 50/50 at the moment. I spend hours with him already as\nhis coach during our two practices and his two game days.\nHe and I have had several discussions on the situation and I have asked him not to put himself in the middle as you have insisted on doing, or blame\nhimself given the ham handed way you have handled this\nSent:01/23/2024 at 10:26 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 10:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nAttachments:IMG_1019.JPG (86 KB)",
