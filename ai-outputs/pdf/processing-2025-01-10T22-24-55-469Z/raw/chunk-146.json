That said if you could tell Joe\nin a way that does not make it look like we are getting a divorce it would be better coming from you than his coach/dad who should not be approving\nhis absence two weeks in a row...\nSent:01/19/2024 at 11:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 12:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball tonight\nMessage 535 of 4024\nLet me talk to him when he gets home. He will be gone next Friday too so perhaps he should go tonight so it’s not 3 times in a row.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 12:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 12:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball tonight\nMessage 536 of 4024\nThank you!!!\nSent:01/19/2024 at 12:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball tonight\nMessage 537 of 4024\nI am reaching out to Dr. Brown to assist in guidance for parenting plan. I believe it will be important for her to discuss with Adrian and myself. I\nimagine you would want to provide your version of events too.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 02:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 02:40 PM)\nSubject:Dr. Brown\nMessage 538 of 4024\nOf course it would. I want to help in anyway I can. But I don’t know what you two think he saw. I know I did not pull up porn. I know it was not\nyour nudie pics. I have a ton of footage on my phone, including of the garage and foyer on the day of the move with a time date stamp.I know there is\nnothing stored. I saw an alert. Thats it. If it was you, are you even sure you were where he thought he saw you? Because it’s a *.gif so it’s pretty\nimportant. Can we please, please discuss between us so we can have an informed session. I have agreed to any and all of the restraints suggested. But it’\ns fair and will be super helpful if I know what I’m being accused of. Please let me help.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 02:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 02:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr. Brown",
