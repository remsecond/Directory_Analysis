Can you please put it in the driveway.\nSent:01/11/2024 at 04:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Snow Blower\nMessage 354 of 4024\nOk...\nso if something happens to me. An emergency for example, you are knowingly and intentionally taking away the only way I can get medical aide.\nI don’t understand that, especially if you don’t use it at all, and I have no need to enter our Kirkland home, but that seems like your final decision.\nSent:01/11/2024 at 04:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Snow Blower\nMessage 355 of 4024\nDoes not seem like you are responding. Is there any chance we can chat for a few minutes? I don’t want an already awful situation to get even worse.\nWe really worked well as a team this week. Then we fought Tuesday night due to miscommunication. So I stepped back for a day to give you space.\nI heard what you said, I disagreed, but know now fighting will only lead to a shittier situation for both of us and as a result will then impact our kids.\nPlease just share what’s up. I’m happy to stay backed off like yesterday. I listen and do my best. But if you don’t tell me, I don’t know what to correct.\nPlease, let’s not repeat that pattern. It’s cost so much.\nSent:01/11/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Communication\nMessage 356 of 4024\nWill you please respond?\nSent:01/12/2024 at 08:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 08:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
