Because who you are here is dramatically different than the OFW Christine.\nAre we good with the poke plan before you do it again and complain about my respond to your poke? It’s Groundhog Day with you, and I want to\nstop\nSent:01/22/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 01:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA\nMessage 631 of 4024\nWe have a difference of opinion.\nYour emails started with you couldn’t figure where I put it in the mess of boxes and bags. Putting blame on me for not having AAA card. That\nappeared to be a first poke.\nI responded that I gave it to.\nThat seemed to provide you with enough that I poked you first versus responding to your attack, to decide it appropriate to launch into what you\nwrote, which was not related to location of card at all.\nYour perspective.\nUnless you need any additional help with AAA I’ll consider the issue for AAA help closed.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 01:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 01:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA\nMessage 632 of 4024\nSo... for future reference I consider a road side emergency, urgent. Coupled with the dynamic state of our shared services and transfer of property,\nthese are the sort of unplanned situations where I’d like to be able to reach out to you for joined info.\nToday worked. Thank you. But you often go 5-20 hours between checking. That doesn’t work. We need text and calls till we are more sorted.
