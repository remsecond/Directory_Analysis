Ever. Even the parenting plan or the December freeze out from seeing the kids. As all of that drug on for\nmonths. I always work with you. Always. Even when we are mad,\nand I ask Lisa a question I tell her I don’t want to act because we give it a day and then we are more reasonable with each other. WTH have I done that\nyou can’t even tell me? Please just be transparent and let’s keep this on track for a peaceful conclusion.\nSent:01/11/2024 at 03:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/11/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: My Computer",
