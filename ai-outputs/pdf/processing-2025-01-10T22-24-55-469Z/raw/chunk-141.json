I will not plan to be at the home.\nI have asked repeatedly to send the must in email format.

I will inform you of when that is ready and available.\nSent:01/18/2024 at 05:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 05:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thanks for the Abusive Converstaion\nMessage 519 of 4024\nConfirming you are on the Lugg so know if it’s canceled or not.
