  "text": "Message 306 of 4024\nI have replied on the original. I would like to go back to Phase I guidelines. On both sides. If either is in violation we make a decision. Can we agree\nrather than going to the lawyers? I am agreeing to follow guidelines as well. Let’s don’t escalate. Thanks!\nSent:01/08/2024 at 01:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 01:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent and Emergency Contact\nMessage 307 of 4024\nI will unblock. To be used sparingly, primarily for emergencies. The next time it becomes emotional, harassing, unsafe, threatening I will block and\nwe will let lawyers figure it out. I will not compromise on this.\nNo early am or late texts similar to OFW timelines.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 01:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 01:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent and Emergency Contact\nMessage 308 of 4024\nThat sounds like a perfectly rational plan for us to\nmove forward. Let’s do it!\nSent:01/08/2024 at 01:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent and Emergency Contact\nMessage 309 of 4024\nSo I am being FAR more ambitious with the plan today than originally intended. I’m trying to take almost everything I can that has a container.\nThe net is it’s more expensive but your cool with that, but also may take longer. So want you to be aware it may be later for AD pick up. That said, it\nwill be a marathon game so we will likely end at the same time.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 01:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 310 of 4024\nAdrian is aligned to watch with you tonight. Can you confirm pick up and drop off time please and share new address.
