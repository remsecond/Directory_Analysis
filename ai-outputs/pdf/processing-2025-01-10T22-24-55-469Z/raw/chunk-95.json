My\nunmutated reality, as dependable as the laws of gravity, imploded on July 5th. And now I have to completely start my whole life over again at 57.\nEverything has been cast asunder and I start from scratch now.\nShort of losing a kid or chemical burns over 80% of my body, this is my worst possible and unthinkable reality that I could have ever imagined. So\nmuch so, that I am happy to make you a deal. Let's get through with all the treatment, all the therapy, I verify my sobriety for as long as I live, then\nyou quit your job. Travel the world, whatever you want.\nBut I get my soulmate and kids back and we are honest from now on with each other.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 05:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 337 of 4024\nEmails like this make me feel very uncomfortable and triggered. Please stop.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 05:39 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 05:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 338 of 4024\nOk, I can respect that.\nCan you also respect that when you say I’m not working, like I’m on easy street, it ain’t easy.\nAnd tbh- I would not wish what has happened out of the blue to me in July on my worst enemy.\nIt’s almost unthinkably horrible and painful. I will never trust another human being as long as I live.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 05:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 05:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 339 of 4024\nOk... first off. I did not move anything into your path. Especially the brown cabinet. But I pushed some other stuff, also not moved and made room\nto move it like you wanted.\nSecond, I told you several times across several platforms things may be a little undone. That I needed time to reorganize because it was happening in\nthe fly and they leave when they leave. I can send you numerous screen captures.\nThird, I asked the kids be prepared for this. AD is asking why I would take all that stuff from the house. How can I ever use it. And the deck furniture\nSent:01/09/2024 at 07:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:02 PM)\nSubject:Moving to OFW",
