And this is a documented record. Please share where I refused to move forward to jog my memory or quit saying things that\nare untrue. How’s that?\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:30 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 670 of 4024\nThat is ok. I’ll call you. Hope you and your locksmith will have finished up. I am considering this a booked plan of record. So if you need time to tell\nhim about your impending divorce (like the hvac guy) please make it before we are scheduled to talk.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Please call me\nMessage 671 of 4024\nGiven you have 9:30 free and this is the single most important thing in our life. Please document your allegations below or retract them. I have no\ntime for your dishonesty and deception. I have pictures of yours. Please provide equivalent evidence to substantiate your claim. If you can not or\nrefuse to share this will be documented as another one of Christine’s “loose company with the truth” let’s say\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 672 of 4024\nThat is why I moved to OFW. Conversations are not recorded.\nI requested we all meet with Dr. Brown separately. You verbally insisted we align stories first. I refused.\nI will continue my work day. Will Wait for your call at 12:30. If it gets confrontational or abusive i will hang up and in future will ask for recorded\nconversations or have third party on the line.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today",
