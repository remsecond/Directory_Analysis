The kids therapist will be able to hear exactly what they heard in your abuse and screaming to me.\nIf you cared about the kids and I mental health, the abuse would have never started and continued. I have detailed notes.\nI do not care to debate your falsehoods in this forum.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV\nMessage 225 of 4024\nThere is a difference in the way we start our days here. See attached. I’m going to try to continue the way I do it. We used to have (and what I see now\nwas crazy) an agreement to never start a day mad.\nI am hoping that in cases where you are itching for a fight, but still wait till the next day to unleash, that we can just put that hate on ice instead of\nruining another day straight from the get go. It’s a new day.\nNow we will have all day trying to grapple with the crap we could have dealt with before bed but decided to kick off the day with. My suspicion is\nactually you will drop a nuke and check out.\nThat’s just your style.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:43 AM)\nSubject:Starting The Day\nAttachments:IMG_0763_1.PNG (252 KB)",
