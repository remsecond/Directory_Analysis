You have said for months in “running list” syncs you stopped using that a long time ago. Trying to understand the\ndiscrepancy between your words/emails and what you are saying now. That’s all! Thanks!\nSent:01/25/2024 at 11:59 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 12:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card\nMessage 739 of 4024\nYou still struggle mightily with answering the questions I ask.

You were somehow aware and emailed me. After discovery of cameras my suspicions\ncontinue of inside monitoring. All remaining personal items should be removed from the home.\nYou have stopped compliance with soberlink and children expressed concerns that I need to address.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 12:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items\nMessage 741 of 4024\nThere continues to be spend on card, especially since we are unable to keep sufficient cash in BofA account to cover basics such as mortgage tuition\nand rent. We have overdrawn. You control the msft account (which is community property) but the other investment account I am able to access\nMoving forward I too will initiate stock sales if cash runs low.\nThe sales of msft stock from that account is from community funds. You have blocked me from accessing and I currently have no visibility.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:08 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 12:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card",
