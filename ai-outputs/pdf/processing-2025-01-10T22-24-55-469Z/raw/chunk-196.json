What else?\nSent:01/23/2024 at 04:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 05:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: What’s the plan for the TV?\nMessage 711 of 4024\nNo. The letter was clear no more calls, texts, emails.\nThe lawyer should explain details of the restraining order and implications.\nThe asks for details are exactly what I sent you. If you are sticking to your story then send that and we will take it from there.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 05:10 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 06:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: Restraining Orde\nMessage 712 of 4024\nThis is going nowhere.\nWhen you are ready for items let me know.\nI’m fine with not swapping tvs. Keep it. Not worth the mental energy.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 05:13 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 06:16 AM)\nSubject:Re: What’s the plan for the TV?\nMessage 713 of 4024\nFollowing up on Alki.\nLet me know if I keep or cancel Alki clean out move. They are scheduled for 8am on Saturday. I can’t make it as I will be in Whistler with Adrian so\nyou would need to let them in. They can let themselves out.\nAlternatively we could just tell landlords we can reschedule to another date when repairs are complete.\nAny other items to exit Alki?\nOther items I can think of:\nTerminate xfinity - Robert\nCancel renters insurance- Christine\nSent:01/24/2024 at 08:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 06:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: Alki",
