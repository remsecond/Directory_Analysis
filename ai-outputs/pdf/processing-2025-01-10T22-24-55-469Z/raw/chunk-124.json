  "text": "Message 451 of 4024\nI did not add a camera to our network and that would imply someone has access to our home network password which is not possible.\nIf the insinuation is that someone added a camera Wednesday night, then one yesterday that is just not possible. I had tried to disconnect power to\ninternet in the afternoon to try fix my laptop but that did not work.\nIt does seem to imply to me that there are additional cameras that I have not located added by someone who has access to our internet password.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 02:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 02:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Cams\nMessage 452 of 4024\nThis is a highly inappropriate email Robert. I have requested on numerous occasions that you stop these types of emails. Given the circumstances and\nconflict we have, this is incredibly insulting to me.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 03:00 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card\nMessage 453 of 4024\nWhoa... all it takes is putting the batteries in and having it in WiFi range. It has nothing to do with adding it. It just needs to light up with power close\nenough to the network. That is it.\nI am only telling you what I see. I am not insinuating anything. I am happy to discuss this in more detail. And I’m happy to show you how to change\nthe password. I hope you will actually.\nIs your laptop still busted? I thought it was fixed. Can we FaceTime when you get home and I can tell you what diagnostics to do on your computer?\nYou can’t not have a working laptop at home.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 03:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 03:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Cams\nMessage 454 of 4024\nI apologize.\nI thought it was an idium, like when pigs fly or hell freezes over.\nI’m sorry.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 03:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 03:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card",
