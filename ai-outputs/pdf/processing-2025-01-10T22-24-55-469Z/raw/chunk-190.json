I don’t want it to be that way anymore.\nYou do what you need to do, but I want to separate business from pleasure and quit acting so butt hurt.\nTonight made a big impact on me. I realized that could be our future. Not the nonsense I’m creating.\nI am hoping we can find time soon for a long walk or even better, the Dolar Shop or a window seat at Flo.\nBe well, Christine\nSent:01/23/2024 at 01:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 01:33 PM)\nSubject:After an Amazing Night\nAttachments:IMG_1026.PNG (772 KB)\nMessage 685 of 4024\nYou keep saying that I have multiple WiFis in our home. I keep telling you that is untrue. My best guess is there is some sort of appliance network set\nup. I wanted to help you, have offered daily, and you continue to refuse it. This, even though I have fixed any and every issue you have had\nimmediately and in front of you. Still happy to help. I still see issues.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 01:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 01:33 PM)\nSubject:WiFi",
