It’s is documented.\nSent:01/18/2024 at 04:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 04:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Friday Move\nMessage 515 of 4024\nI have sent my list. Phone calls are never explosive because you just hang up. It’s easy. Can we just do that? Hang up like always if you don’t like it.\nText and emails always devolve because they are not a platform for a discussion. They are great for updates and simple questions. That is not what we\nare doing.\nCan we just cooperate for once?\nSent:01/18/2024 at 04:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 04:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: Friday Move\nMessage 516 of 4024\nSent:01/18/2024 at 04:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 09:23 PM)\nSubject:Thanks for the Abusive Converstaion",
