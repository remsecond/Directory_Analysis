Not sure\nif we need some big trash bags but if you have, bring.\nNote that I am waiting for a spot to charge so I can get back and forth today. I will be underground of course with no cell or WiFi. But promise to\ncheck once I’m out of the cave and head to Sbux in my way.\nThanks for the cooperation! I’ll be sure not to contribute to the mistakes made yesterday.\nMessage 587 of 4024\nNoted the email. I have my coffee but thank you.\nI’ll have him there early.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 12:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 12:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: I’ll check OFW so no misunderstandings\nMessage 588 of 4024\nOk. But this will be hot???\nDon’t forget a water bottle.\nI’ll see you in 30 minutes\nSent:01/20/2024 at 12:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 12:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: I’ll check OFW so no misunderstandings\nMessage 589 of 4024\nWell... you made the right call... I’ve been standing here almost since I ordered... my drink is still nowhere in sight. 20 minutes is way to long to pull a\nshot and add hot water.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 12:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 12:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: I’ll check OFW so no misunderstandings\nMessage 590 of 4024\nWe have discussed plans all week. We even made good progress. Now at the time we are supposed to go finish you bail with zero warning.\nThen I propose to do a Lugg to satisfy you at my expense. To move the complete black box of stuff you insisted on pulling out whether I need it or\nnot.\nIf you think you can be depended on for any commitment at all, just take a moment and reflect on last night and the plans we had for today.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 02:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 02:03 PM)\nSubject:Zero Progress",
