  "text": "It appears you read these even if you won’t respond.\nMessage 266 of 4024\nI may try and change the Wednesday LUGG to be a bigger truck so we can reduce trips. But sharing what I have booked now.\nWe will probably swap some stuff (mattresses,\nliving room set for study?) And neither of us want the table and chairs.\nBut that can wait for a v.next plans discussion. I think the goal right now should be to get to a reasonable and functional state.\nI can send calendar updates. Note that unless you tell me, that are only going to go to Hotmail. So hope that you see them.\nI plan on not letting perfect be the enemy of good and just trying to get shit done. I’m sure you agree.\nSent:01/07/2024 at 03:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 03:46 PM)\nSubject:LUGGs\nAttachments:IMG_0828.PNG (337 KB)",
