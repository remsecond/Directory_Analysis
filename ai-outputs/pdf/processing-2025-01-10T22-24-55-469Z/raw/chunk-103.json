Then you had him Sunday for ski, returning him for\nan overnight on Sunday. I planned to see if Max would join at some point for MLK day to see the new place and have a family dinner. I would have all\nkids back by 8:30 PM on Monday. I hope that our plan still applies. Please do let me know so I can prepare and we can do the exchange in a way that\naffords you comfort and an assurance of safety.\nBest Regards,\nrobert\nSent:01/13/2024 at 11:06 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 11:10 AM)\nSubject:Kids this Weekend\nMessage 369 of 4024\nHi Robert,\nGiven the recent events, I am not going to move forward with what you outlined below or the temp plan we had worked on with Dr. Brown.\nWhat you did to myself and boys is serious with\nImmediate consequences.\nOur lawyers are in communication and are negotiating next steps.\nYour message below shows a complete lack of understanding of the seriousness of the situation and impact on the children and myself.\nChristine\nSent:01/13/2024 at 11:16 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 11:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kids this Weekend\nMessage 370 of 4024\nDo you want to arrange for a Lugg pick from Kirkland place today to your residence? I will be home between now and 6pm so anytime then to assist\nthe lugg people. I do not want you assisting in this end.\nIt wonâ€™t be everything but I have a good start on items that can go over.\nBig items are peloton, your bike, inversion, grill, green egg. Let me know if anything else.\nI have gathered clothes, ski gear, some electronics, art, decor, miscellaneous household items in front room so it should be an easy load up.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:09 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:13 PM)\nSubject:Lugg today",
