Anyway, the place is a freaking\nmess.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:18 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 09:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 465 of 4024\nOk. Is it a mess because of the leak or our issue\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 09:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 466 of 4024\nIt’s both. The leak is a disaster. I shared the pics.\nThe place has no big stuff but I have to disassemble all the little things I did to make it the weekend vacation spot you so adored. And we just have a\nlot of  little things that we collected as important memories as a couple and a family. Then there  are a lot of things you have here so that you could\nlook amazing on our most important night, every week. Clothes, make up, etc...\nIt’s f’ing hard. That was not soothing. That was love.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 09:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 467 of 4024\nPlease leave that commentary out. It shows a lack of understanding of my current mental state.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:41 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 09:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment",
