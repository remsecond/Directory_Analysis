We can do dinner here if that works.\nIt’s a football game so hope it’s done by 9:00. But we will be in the car immediately after the finish of the game.\nMoyer Family\n1919 Killarney Way\nBellevue, Wa 98004\nSent:01/08/2024 at 04:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 312 of 4024\nOk.

Please be mindful of traffic. It was a bear so consider your timing.\nMove is going well. Will share more later. But I can’t do 3 this week.\nWe also need to coordinate on when I can come over in the AM to prep. It’s a shit ton of work.\nI’ll probably try to go with beach stuff for this sitting room to save $ and we can talk beds and bikes later.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 05:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 05:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 314 of 4024\nOk.
