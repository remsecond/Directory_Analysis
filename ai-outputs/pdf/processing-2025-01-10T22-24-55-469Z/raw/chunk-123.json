I have no idea where. I reached out to plumber to\nschedule time to look. If that’s what furnace issue is let me know and I will cancel the plumber.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 02:52 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 02:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card\nMessage 449 of 4024\nI got an alert, the same one I got on Wednesday night. A blink camera was added to our home network at around 3:30 yesterday afternoon. So was\njust asking what was up because the alert fired. That’s all.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 02:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 02:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Cams\nMessage 450 of 4024\nShould be totally unrelated. I’ll share the recommendation they made. We definitely don’t want to do it unless we reconcile and renew our vows.\nSent:01/16/2024 at 02:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/16/2024 at 02:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card",
