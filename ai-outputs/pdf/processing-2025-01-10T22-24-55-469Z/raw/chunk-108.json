I hope that the way we are doing this is acceptable given the situation and I\nam not expecting a response here. But if you do replay here I will pay attention and reply accordingly. I am not trying to force you away from OFW in\nany way. Thanks!\n-----------------------------------------Email Below------------------------------------------------\n<<I got a \"message undeliverable\" the first two times?>>\nOk. I tried to organize things a bit. Logistically you make the rules on how this happens, and I am happy to go along with them. If there is confusion, I\nam happy to facetime to answer any questions. Thank you for the time and cooperation in this process... We agreed we would not send junk. Let's\nwait till mediation when we need to make big decisions on our final places. We will Swedish clean and put stuff in storage...\nSuggested for Monday move are noted in GREEN and roughly prioritized. Items noted in RED can be later. Just trying to be realistic.\nInside Stuff\nAmazon Packages and Mail\nComputer stuff in the guest bedroom (is packed)\nTV Swap\nSent:01/14/2024 at 09:51 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 09:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",
