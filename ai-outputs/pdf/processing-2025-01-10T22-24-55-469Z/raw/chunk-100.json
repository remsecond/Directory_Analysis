  "text": "Message 357 of 4024\nOur lawyers are talking today at 4 then you will get an update I am sure.\nI don’t control your behavior and I must act and respond accordingly. There are consequences to any actions you and I take. We need to own that.\nOnce you and your lawyer have had time to digest, I’m sure you will formulate a response.\nI believe you likely know the issue but probably did not think through the consequences and fall out. Maybe you did and just did not care.\nRegardless, we are in this situation that I did not create but must respond to.\nSent:01/12/2024 at 08:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 08:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 358 of 4024\nWhat on god’s green earth are you talking about Christine? I am trying so hard to work with you. I want to be a good partner and coparent here. We\ngot the parenting plan in place. We finally have me on the east side. We are good to go once I have my stuff. Please don’t stop this! We are on the verge\nof finally being in a position to not have anything to fight about. This is what we wanted. We don’t need to argue over anything anymore. Please help\nme understand why we can’t do that?\nSent:01/12/2024 at 09:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 09:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 359 of 4024\nI am not responsible for your actions and there is accountability and consequences to that. You can work out your response via your lawyers.\nDon’t waste my time with your pretend lack of understanding what the issue is. I am over the manipulation and abuse.\nI am working today and will not continue this. I will wait for response from your lawyers.\nSent:01/12/2024 at 09:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 09:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 360 of 4024\nWhat are you talking about?\nIf you please share we can have an informed discussion. I am happy to speak to anything you think I have done to you. I want to course correct and\nmake this a civil and workable relationship. We will be stuck doing this for the rest of our lives in some form or another. Let’s don’t blow it all up.\nPlease don’t repeat July 5th.\nSent:01/12/2024 at 09:14 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/12/2024 at 09:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
