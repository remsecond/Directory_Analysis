If it is\nurgent I don’t bother with it here because there is likely a couple of rounds back and forth. That’s why I sent an email to ask if we could text if it was\nan urgent ask. That’s all.\nCan you get off my D while I’m trying to do something that is helping you out so you can work?\nI’m freaking trying to carry the water for us both here as best I can, Christine.

See attached.\nI am worried he feels like he is to blame for this. That is the last thing we want and what they say always to be on the lookout for in a divorce. His text\npains me and makes my heart hurt.\nI’d like to be able to see him today to reassure him this is an issue you and I are addressing, and he has zero to do with it. I want to encourage open and\nhonest conversations with both of us.\nThanks!\nSent:01/17/2024 at 01:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 02:02 PM)\nSubject:Adrian\nAttachments:AD_Text.jpg (85 KB)",
