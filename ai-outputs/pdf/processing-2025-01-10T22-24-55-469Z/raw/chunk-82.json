I think it’s too late to make a change this morning. But are you happy with the beach set? If you are going to replace, I can probably live with it\nand save the dough till we have more details.\nAgree the mattress situation may look funny however, but I’m assuming in the near term we will be the only one who sees it? Let’s go with current\nplan today and decide after we at least get functional.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 07:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 07:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: Bedroom set\nMessage 295 of 4024\nThank you! The game starts at 4:30. Happy to get some juice and grab him after Ms Nora (and grab more clothes). Then have him home after.\nMax looked like he was dragging. Bummer.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 07:58 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 08:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: This Week\nMessage 296 of 4024\nStarting my day at a charger again. It’s a huge pain in the booty to do this every other day. And doing it at your office is almost unbearable for me...\nI’ll try and be creative in ways to solve charging at the Treehouse (ADs nick name for the Bellevue place... lol) but I need a solution so getting it on\nyour radar.\nCraziest but cheapest option “may” be running a splitter to dryer outlet (240v) and use an RV cable to run power out to the carport and charge. I’ll\nresearch.\nBut I’d want an electrician to Ok that scenario. So the minimum cost is going to be an hour with someone qualified to approve my hair brained\nscheme.\nJust want to share plans and be transparent with any spend prior to the “big decision”. Please let me know if this is going to be an issue for you.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 09:04 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 09:30 AM)\nSubject:My Gas Station",
