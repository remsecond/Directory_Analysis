If\nyou are insisting we do it now, I would suggest we split half of each stock interest, factoring in acquisition date.\nWe can work on plan for division of assets. We need to get financial declarations to lawyers with all the details of bank accounts. Investments, ccs,\nassets etc\nSent:01/25/2024 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 08:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity\nMessage 726 of 4024\nOk.\nConfirming I have reached out to landlord to align and arrange timing for move out cleaning with twinkle and expectations.\nI am not aware of any other action items to return apartment to landlord.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 08:46 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 08:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 727 of 4024\nAt this time, I understand that:\n- You have gone through my all personal items. You tried to hide that you had. We discussed over dim sum.\n- I have zero say in any parenting decisions. You are asserting 100% legal custody and refuse all access to our kids.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 09:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 09:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items\nMessage 728 of 4024\nI am not suggesting that. You are smart enough to know what I said. You’re insistence on misreading or acting like you do not understand the most\nbasic message and reply with a twisting of words is common but also tiring.\nIf you really struggle with what I am saying to you, it will save us a lot of cycles if you can have someone read my email and explain what it means. You\ncan also use popular AI tools that will assist in explaining your mother tongue.\nPlease consider options to save us both time. Till then, I’ll consider this conversation done. If you find a way to assist your reading comprehension, I’ll\nbe happy to discuss again.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 09:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 09:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity",
