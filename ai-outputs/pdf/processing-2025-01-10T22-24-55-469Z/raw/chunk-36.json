  "text": "Christine-\nPlease take a look at the attachment. If we have agreed on Phase I, that is great. Let's go ahead and move forward. I have updated the doc with \"track\nchanges\" turned on.\nObviously, we are not at all in agreement for Phase II. Specifically, if the best I can even do is 65/35 for AD with zero guaranteed for Max. And\nunnecessary disruption for them.\nI also never get a real vacation in your plan, as it has to be within Uber distance. Spring Break will give you Hong Kong, California Theme Parks, and\nCabo all in a row with Mom.\nPerhaps the easiest way to review is to start by accepting changes, looking at the way it reads to assure you are OK with the suggested updates, and\nseeing notes on the side.\nI'm looking forward to your feedback so we can send the areas of disagreement to Dr. Brown. She can provide suggestions for mutually disappointing\ntiebreaks, and we move forward.\nSent:12/30/2023 at 08:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/30/2023 at 08:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Parenting Plan Review",
