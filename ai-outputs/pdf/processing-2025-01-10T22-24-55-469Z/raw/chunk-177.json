If you have one, please let me know.\nOtherwise these are super expensive. Wow. That said I am impressed you can find the perfect gift by “shopping for” recommendations.\nCheck it out! You can send one that says to the other person that you are just thinking of them so they think of you. Or even that you love them.\nI just thought they were glasses or candle holders. They are actually not. They are deep and meaningful gifts to illicit mutual feelings. Awesome!\nBTW- the sexy Cum Together rocker with the message of enhancing someone’s flavor, over time, is sold out. Tell KO to hold on to that one!\nHmmm... I was saying that because he can sell on eBay for more. But he won’t sell those. They were a gift from his dirty married secret.\nIt’s funny because you saw how much your gift of Cabo glasses meant to me. No inscription, 20% of the price. He’s lucky by comparison to me.\nBut it is what it is. I was just your soulmate of 30 years. Father of all three of your children, even taking one on that you made without me.\nKO is your secret. The secret worth trashing the Moyer family for. I get why you don’t want to talk to the kids.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:06 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:06 AM)\nSubject:Glassy Baby\nAttachments:IMG_1013.PNG (1 MB)",
