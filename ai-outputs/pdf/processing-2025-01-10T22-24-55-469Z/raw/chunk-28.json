I hope you and I can start to heal from this craziness\nand communicate better in all of our best interests.\nI really hope we can get to co-parents and even better at some point. I am going to try extra hard to use my own internal “snark meter”. So please let\nme know immediately if it appears that I am not.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 05:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 05:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Winter Break (not urgent)\nMessage 119 of 4024\nI was mortified to see that whenever you do anything here I get a five alarm fire alarm and you get nothing. I thought it was an intentional feature.\nYou must have thought I was honestly psycho. I get it now, but I was super confused before.\nSo... when we are comfortable we can sit side by side and compare notes to see how we both have the same experience. We have rules that will help\nanyway so maybe it’s not relevant but I totally understand where you were coming from.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 06:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:OFW (not urgent)\nMessage 120 of 4024\nI’ve been thinking about this more and have some ideas of how we might do this. It will require you to help and even some teamwork, but if you\nbelieve Max should have a healthy relationship with his Father I hope that won’t be an issue.\nI’d like to share them with you tomorrow and hope you will approach with an open mind with a goal of getting the entire family a bit more “re-\nunified” since the events of July 5th.\nThis has been a real struggle and has only gotten worse, but given we know we are getting a divorce and will lead separate lives, I hope we can do right\nbe the kids and each other and take a healthy approach once the parenting plan is in place.\nLooking forward to a constructive conversation.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:23 PM)\nSubject:Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 121 of 4024\nI am open to hear what your thoughts are in our discussion tomorrow.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)",
