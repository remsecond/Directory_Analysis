Just cooperation.\nPlease let’s start the new year with an excuse to do better.\nMessage 146 of 4024\nThe solution offered by the professional was reunification therapy with Max which I hope will start soon\nThe professional also recommended we not talk directly but communicate through this app. I agree with that recommendation as it has been not\ngood for either of our mental health.\nAs Adrian transitions back to me I request you respect the same courtesy afforded you during your time with him and refrain from communications\nunless essential. We both agree that has worked well.\nSent:12/31/2023 at 04:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/31/2023 at 04:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 147 of 4024\nSo Dr Brown said\n- Marriage therapy with all three of us on Sat\n- Divorce therapy to us in an email Thursday\n- You are saying that she said don’t talk at all\nIt’s fair to say:\n- we have heard different things each time\n- we choose the one that we each want to hear\n- none of it is working and we are ignoring that\nSo what is the definition of insanity?\nWhy are you fighting against trying to learn to work together? Really? Is it for appearances to someone else? Is it pride? It’s not working. It’s our kids\nmental health. Quit hearing what you want to hear and only adopting what you want. For Christ’s sake Christine, let’s try something that allows us to\nwork together.\nIs it that dangerous?
