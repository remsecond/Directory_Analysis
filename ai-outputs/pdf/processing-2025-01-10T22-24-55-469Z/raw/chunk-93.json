  "text": "Message 329 of 4024\nAs mentioned in my text just now I am in the middle of a conversation with Elsa about my new place. She asked about it. Her next question was\nabout her wedding budget and when we could discuss it this week. But she knows we are super busy and canceling things already just to get through\nthe week.\nShe also sees us laying out cash because of our divorce now that I have a reasonable place. But this is our retirement not a pile of money that is a first\ncome first serve. The timing (in the same breath) is just to sus after not hearing about it for months.\nI’ll also be taking stuff from the house today. I’ve done a decent job prepping AD that we are a team on this effort. But in absence of a discussion I\ndon’t care for this to look like I am just taking all this stuff from Mom and by proxy, them. I need help establishing me as an equal in this effort, not a\nthief or cheat.\nHope we can partner on showing support.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 09:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 11:43 AM)\nSubject:Elsa’s Wedding\nMessage 330 of 4024\nSo, Elsa is asking to discuss wedding finances this week. On the day she found out I finally got a place. I'm not sure what there is to discuss since our\nlast conversation at Flo. And I've been out of the loop since Cabo was canceled. Please feel free to go ahead and meet without me. I don't want to gate\non progress now that this is urgent. I trust ya!\nSent:01/09/2024 at 11:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 11:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Elsa’s Wedding\nMessage 331 of 4024\nBut I do need some reassurance. I am working my ass off and trying to do right by you. I am giving it my level best to set us up for success by\nextricating myself from your space which will limit the acrimony from continuous property conversations. I am trying to help our relationship\nimprove.\nWhat I cannot stand is repeating recent history and the explosion of our marriage. I am asking you be 100% honest with me at this moment. We are\nworking well together, and it hopefully is the start of things to come. But if you are just going to tell me later, you did this to get me the fuck out of\nyour life so you can move to something new before we close this out, it will be too much for me.\nI like the way this is. I want to continue. This way has so much potential. But we know the excuses of the past and the devastation it caused us and so\nmany people who depend on us. Please tell me if you are being honest with me now, or if this is just a show again because you think I will be triggered\notherwise. I have to know this time, now that I have learned my lesson the hard way.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 12:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:I don't need to be soothed...",
