  "text": "Of course you can\nalso reflect on your\nmarriage vows as well\nMessage 591 of 4024\nMarriage vows do not allow you to abuse and terrorize your partner and children for 25 years. Please reflect on that.\nLet me know what items you want the lugg to pick up and I will set aside. I can put the remaining items that are your things in storage for when you\nhave time and space to sort through.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 02:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 10:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress\nMessage 592 of 4024\nThanks! Let's please do a quick review:\n- To have and to hold from this day forward <<nope, KO interrupted that>>\n- For better, for worse <<nope, you acted like it was better, then said it was worse>>\n- For richer, for poorer <<nope, as soon as my settlement payout cashed, so did you>>\n- In sickness and in health <<nope, not for medically certified diseases, like SUDs>>\n- Forsaking all others <<nope, I have pictures of \"KO\" from your that prove otherwise>>\n- To love and to cherish <<nope, you lied repeatedly then dumped me with no warning>>\n- Until death do us part <<nope, if you are reading this and I'm typing, we are still here>>\nYou can mentally wrestle with this all you like to fit your narrative. You can say that fucking me 3 times a day, regular date nights, shrooming every\nweekend, healthy handmade lunches on the regular, musings of time alone, house hunting for the next chapter, dreaming of our future... was just\nsoothing. It was not. You were all in, above and beyond. And I fucking LOVED YOU for YOU!\nThe reality is you really do get it. You act like you don't, but your not so stupid not to realize the difference between \"soothing\", which would be just\nkeeping it on the rails vs. doing everything you could, going above and beyond, to show me we were working, we are on the right track. The changes\nmade were being rewarded. You made me happier than I have ever been in my life.\nThe narrative you are trying to rewrite makes you feel better. You self-soothe. Yes, I was an alcoholic, I did fight mean (as we both still do) But\nmarriage is about honesty and transparent communication. THAT IS THE COMMITMENT. You did none of that. You said \"fuck it\" I'm done.\nYou washed your hands clean without so much as a peep that what I was doing was not right.\nYou ruined our marriage with your dishonesty and deception. Period. You can justify it by saying I would not have changed. But you can NEVER\nSAY YOU TRIED. What you did is not what our wedding vows mean. You broke every single one of them, Christine. You owed me the truth, not\nlies and deception. You were my fucking rock. My proudest moment. My queen forever.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 10:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 10:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress",
