  "text": "Message 613 of 4024\nI’m frustrated back. I’m frustrated that we saw our son in a very bad mental state. It is a big red flashing siren to this parent. I would think it would\nalarm you.\nBy contrast you started scolding me for wanting to address our kids mental health when there is something, visible and undeniable going on.\nYeah, I’m frustrated that making our child’s mental health a priority frustrates you.\nSent:01/21/2024 at 09:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 05:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD\nMessage 614 of 4024\nThat you are only nice to me when you want something. Like the money for the Porsche, or getting our house clean. When you told me that you\nwanted to hate me forever tonight, it hit hard. I wish you well.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 02:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 05:13 AM)\nSubject:I realized this weekend..\nMessage 615 of 4024\nHis frustration was the game.\nHe is also struggling with ICS. Do you plan to attend the event tonight? I’d like to get the email to Jonathan to start the process. I know they have\noffers out for next year so I’m not sure how that would factor into the decision and thinking on their end.\nLmk if I send the email. Happy to do so.\nI am also going to follow up with therapist to try get that started.\nIn regards to Dr Brown, I’d like to get her engaged to start discussion with him to get his perspective on what happened, then circle back with us\nindividually. Lmk on that end too.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 07:52 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD\nMessage 616 of 4024\nI am planning to look at Alki tonight and get as much as possible in my car. Elsa will try join.\nI can evaluate if we need to hire movers for remaining items. I confirmed with Deavon we can reach out to him separately.
