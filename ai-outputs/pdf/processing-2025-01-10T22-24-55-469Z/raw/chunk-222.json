Still, all my fault even if it was just a series of honest,\nwell meaning, mistakes.\nPlease let me know if you would like a UA and I’ll be more than happy to accommodate. I will also let you know if I find it or not by end of day so I\ncan offer next steps for your consideration.\nI consider this to be child related, so hope you agree even if it is part of a parenting plan we don’t have. So hope OFW is suitable for this.\nRegardless of having nothing mandating this, it is still important to me to demonstrate my commitment to sobriety and assure you that I am always\nsober even when I can’t see my kids.\nObviously if we need to address in front of a judge at some point soon, I’m sure Elsa will testify to this, but it is ultimately still my responsibility.\n- robert\nMessage 811 of 4024\nI assumed you knew it said that.
