Done.\nAs far as I am concerned, we should be done for the day until we meet at 4:35.\nIf you need me, I'm available on all platforms for urgent items or emergencies.\n-best\nMessage 205 of 4024\nUgh... sorry, forgot this. Confirming we got some spare checks into ADs backpack. Plan to see some CL stuff today at 3:00 and will need them.\nThanks!\nSent:01/03/2024 at 09:49 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 10:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nMessage 206 of 4024\nI did not. I just checked and we actually do not even have enough in BofA to cover max’s tuition that is due in 2 days of 7,612.\nAre you able to transfer at least 5k into BofA. There is 5817 in there now.\nIf you want checks they are in my office drawer on left hand side. But we will need additional cash in the account for it to clear.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 10:33 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 10:34 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nMessage 207 of 4024\nGood stuff. I’ll make a transfer now and send you the info. Phew... that 100k went fast. But at least we paid down the most spendy debt which was\nwise.\nAre you sure we can’t figure out how to nest?\nHonestly my hope is that after we are both in CBT and have our “safe coms” therapy, we can undo the mess we self inflicted since July and start\nmaking smart fiscal decisions. That’s  months out, but that’s ok.\nI’ll swing by before I grab AD. I can also just grab his\nlaptop on that trip to save us time after pick up.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 10:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 10:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nMessage 208 of 4024\nActually let me know how I can pay  Alki rent. I have no visibility to funds in the other Fidelity account. So let me know which account I pay Alki\nSent:01/03/2024 at 10:46 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List",
