Let's try 9:00 if that works for pick-up.\nAre we going to discuss settings here and expectations? Or did you do all of that? Who else has access to this? We should probably both align on what\nyou did, agree?\nrobert\nSent:12/23/2023 at 06:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/23/2023 at 08:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Christmas Holidays\nMessage 3 of 4024\nYou ignored my question about discussing the settings and how this is used both here and in text. And I don’t know what to expect wrt response\ntime. I have zero info on this all or the way you set it up. When you want to discuss we can move back to it. Till then, I’m out! Thanks!\nSent:12/23/2023 at 08:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/23/2023 at 09:41 PM)\nSubject:Done using this\nMessage 4 of 4024\nPlease refer to Dr Brown communication guidelines and response timelines and expectations. I did not adjust any settings.\nI am not going to revert to a communication method that has proven volatile for you.\nIf you refuse to use this service, please suggest an alternative. This was the service your lawyer suggested as well and you signed up for in September.\nSent:12/23/2023 at 09:44 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/23/2023 at 10:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Done using this",
