Really an awesome day. AD is just amazing. And I really love coaching his team. I’m in my element. For that\nmatter, I’ve turned a corner I think. I look great, feel great, and we have a parenting plan so all my big problems are solved.\nThat said, I did miss your voice on this special day for the first time in 29 years. Even when we talked late at night from River Oaks Parkway to\nSeymour Road. There will be a lot of firsts in our ending. That’s fine. But tbh, I still love some part of you. I don’t feel bad about it either.\nAnd you say I don’t have that kind of access to you, so that is fine. But when I pledged to love you till death do us part, I meant it. And I still do. And\neven though you hate everything about me, I know in my heart I never held malice for you. I learned wrong. Not an excuse, a reality.\nI’m not asking you for anything. And I’m entitled to my own feelings and my own reality. It’s me that we\nare talking about after all. And I know more about the how, why, and intent of my actions than anyone, even you. So I’m ok telling you I know my\ntruth. And we can both be right.\nHope when things get better I can have a rain check on my bday dinner.

It will likely be a couple of\nweeks to complete but it’s a start.\nI hope that you are pleased I negotiated a 9 month lease. Very few places will do that but I made it clear that was the reason this place was even in\nconsideration.\nSo while it may bother you, I am tried my best and it’s a competitive rent in this market. And it’s near you, a SAAS bustop, and the kids should\napprove of the space.\nI’d also like to make some purchase descriptions today. (Example: ScanPan, Linens, Towels, organizing stuff- Kitchen and closet, etc...) I think we\nagreed for some of these we both need a refresh.

It is my understanding of the current situation. But I’m not a lawyer. It was also a plea to work together so we made\nsmart fiscal decisions for the long term. My offer still stands>>\nHey-\nI was thinking about what you said about us drawing down your assets since you make more money than I do now even though we continue to pull\nfrom Fidelity the same way we always did to cover the gaps.\nHypothetically Speaking:\n- Let's say I made 5x what you made over 24 years (it was definitely more, given the stock market returns we have seen)\n- In the last year, we got my full 10-month payout, one month of vacation, and now unemployment checks. No bonus or stock.\nAs I understand in community property states, any income earned by either spouse during the marriage and all property bought with those earnings is\nconsidered community property, owned equally by both spouses. Likewise, our debts incurred during our marriage are shared debts. So while I was\nthe primary breadwinner for 24 years and am now unemployed and drawing benefits that are a fraction of your income, the wealth accumulated\nduring the years when I was the primary earner is considered joint property, regardless of who earned more. So when it comes time for us to divide\nassets, the law would look for a fair distribution that considers the entire marriage span, not just the current earning situation. So that's the 24 years I\nwas the primary breadwinner as well as the last few months you were.\nBut what I heard you say is you think you are paying all the bills now because you are the primary earner while we draw from our shared investments\n(which are 1/2 yours). So, given the status quo, how do you think that you are disproportionately contributing to our marital assets? I can understand\nyour perception from an emotional standpoint, but I don't think it aligns with the legal view of community property. Just like I can't say I was paying\nfor everything for the previous 24 years. It might feel unfair given our recent shift in financial dynamics, but I don't get how it's different with you as\nthe main breadwinner, even if the change in our roles feels abrupt or unbalanced. I feel like we just swapped roles for the last couple of months\n(though I don't think you make 4-8x what I did given my payout and unemployment benefits)\nYou worked to make us an effective team, and we could not have accumulated our nest egg without your contributions to our household. Those let\nSent:01/07/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 06:32 PM)\nSubject:You demanded I “Get a Job” and left....",

But in a community asset state, the 50/50 model\ndoesn't change even when our roles are reversed.

So if we are currently drawing from our joint income and investments to pay our bills, why would it be viewed as drawing solely from your\nearnings? Till we divvy everything up, everything is still the same, right? It's just you have been contributing more these last few months. The same\nway I did for the last 24 years is the way that I interpret what is going on now.\nDefinitely not trying to argue. It's just how I interpret community property until we go our own way after the divorce. And as I mentioned today, I\nreally hope we learn to be civil enough to effectively partner with financial professionals to make the best long-term decisions as a team (we both have\na good head on our shoulders). Especially when it comes to things like \"when to sell what\" wrt stock to pay the least amount of taxes as our brackets\nevolve and change. Of course, the same goes for the house and condo sale.

In good time after some healing apart we can\nconsider it.\nBut today you said “I want to tell you something I have never told you before, I endured this for twice as long as you and I have never even had a\nmoment to process”... and it made me think- this is so much more than just me involved.\nI have always made the assumption you were full steam ahead. Happy about it all and loving your decision. No concerns, you won the lottery with\nthat July 5th call- No more Big. And tbh I don’t see the collateral damage weighing on you in the least.\nSo what? Here’s what- the last six months have been sheer unadulterated hell. We have compounded our problem 10x fold. And we created our own\never worsening self fulfilling prophecy of literal doom. And we are spiraling out of control.\nWe can’t turn back time. Too much blood has been shed to forget. But, we still control our future. And we know now so much left unsaid has done\nso much damage, that we should consider doing something different moving forward.\nIn your moment of transparency and honesty I honestly understood where you were coming from. I get it. Finally a window into the black box of\ninexplicable despair that I needed desperately to understand. I even think we have a lot in common.\nThese moments, these hard, honest truths, if we open up, like we have not before, will allow us to be relatable and show vulnerability to each others\nperspective.

For your records and consistency.\nI am also copying and pasting the same content here, but it will not be easy to track or understand inline comments.

Let me know what you think. If we agree, I can distill it\ninto one manageable, prioritized list to share and agree to. I appreciate the help and cooperation. Getting our homes and stuff untangled will go a long\nway. Thanks!    From You:  \"Big items are peloton, your bike, inversion, grill, green egg. Let me know if anything else See below. I have gathered\nclothes, ski gear, some electronics, art, decor, miscellaneous household items in front room so it should be an easy load up. Sounds good. Please don't\nsend junk stuff though. Let's just wait till mediation and when we need to make big decisions on our final places when we need to swedish clean and\nput stuff in storage...\nOriginal \"Split List\" TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).OK You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd\nlike to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in your sitting room.Furniture: I will move our sitting\nroom and guest room stuff to new place.I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may\nprefer that from a measurement perspective. OK for guest room I am using beach stuff so we don;t need to buy anything. If you would prefer it I am\nopen to swapping and renting but it's your call. Patio: We agree it's not used, so I will take, but we can truly divide in mediation.OK They did not\nhave room for the crows nest stuff. I'd like to finish that part of the move.Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.You\ncan take all the grills. I will not use them. Does this include the green egg? If not, I can arrange for the dump. Sounds good. We can move those over.\nNote there is a smoker that is under the hot tub mailbox as well.  Misc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?\nCan take bean bag from man cave, Pelloton, Stair Master, desk all from Man Cave. I have nice Crate and Barrel art pieces that are not hanging up that\nyou can take a look at and decide. You can also take the Moose in living room, cows head on porch.

I pulled out the SBUX set that I bought 10 plus years ago, and have started to use that. LMK if you want the whiteporcelain set\nthat was on wedding registry. Its barely used. and the plateware Christmas set from your mom. Just LMK. Let's wait for medition to start divying up\nmore of the plateware. I am fine for now.  Decorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.OK Love to still do this.\nMy place is bleak. I could really use your help as we discussed. Linens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?\nBoth households could use a refresh. Let's do this. I am happy to let you decide and just dupe. I am happy to order us the sheets that we used at the\nbeach that are so soft on the skin.  Other furniture for consideration\nMaster bedroom: I can use beach stuff as a temp option.

Adrian and I have been texting all weekend and you are correct in that I did not understand the\nsituation as well as I would like to. That goes for both tonight and since this all began. Admittedly I did not grasp the gravity of the situation initially\nand should have treated it with the import and urgency it deserved. In my mind, I had my interpretation of what happened and did not give enough\ncredit to the merit of your interpretation. That was a mistake that I apologize for. I should have been more thoughtful of your perspective. I am sorry.\nWe had a pretty explosive discussion on this topic today. We talked about the back-and-forth between the lawyers and your dissatisfaction with the\ncurrent situation. You told me what your plan of action was and then said that I needed to make it right immediately if I wanted to avoid that\noutcome. I want to be clear that I heard you and have taken action to that end immediately. But there is more to it than that. You feel like your trust\nhas been violated. You feel like that still might be the case. You are not confident in your safety and want to feel comfortable in your own space.\nThat, I agree, is an inalienable right. One that you should not have to ask for. You are entitled to that and I would like to do any and everything in my\npower to assure you have that, not only for yourself but for the children we share. You are all still my family and I would give my dying breath in your\nprotection and I would like the opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Put you at ease. Give you 100% confidence that things you know have happened\nhave an explanation and are not dismissed as crazy musings. No crazymaking, just an honest discussion of the facts comparing our notes.\nWe are clearly in a tenuous legal situation. One that limits our opportunities to speak freely. But... since this all went down, and the gravity of the\nsituation has become clear, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the situation and possible outcomes, peaceful and otherwise.\nAnd because we can't realistically do this in email, I'd like to propose a \"take II\" of our conversation earlier today. I'd like to hear your asks, and present\nthe thoughts I have to see if they might perhaps alleviate your concerns and lay the foundation for an honest path forward peacefully and respectfully.\nIf I may, please note I took time and sat on your email. I am trying to demonstrate the seriousness and respect for the situation I have. And I am scared\nto death to even send this, but I have to try and answer your questions and give you what you need and deserve. If you need time also, please take it.\nBut please consider what I am proposing as well.

I understand that this has caused an invasion of\nyour personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to assure you that my intention was never to monitor you or the boys in a way that would\ncompromise your privacy. I acknowledge your concerns, and in light of those, believe it would be best for us to separate any shared services, such as\nATT and Xfinity, where activity information is accessible to both of us. This will ensure you feel comfortable and secure, knowing that you are not\nunder any form of surveillance. Every account we have is shared today, so you are of course free to examine anything you’d like.\nRegarding your concerns about cameras and electronic monitoring, the Blink cameras at the front door and garage door were installed when we both\nlived in the home. They are plainly visible and serve as deterrents to potential intruders, similar to our security signs. These are the only cameras in\nplace. To explain what happened, I believe when the movers were there Tuesday with all the doors open, the wifi connection to the Blink cameras\nrefreshed.  The cameras have not worked in the past because they are too far from our wifi.  But with a clear line of sight and wifi signal, it allowed the\ncamera(s) to reconnect unexpectedly. But I can confirm I never watched a livestream. I opened an alert when it fired, reviewed move pictures of the\nhouse taken Tuesday, and various other apps and photostories (at different times) when Adrian was visiting Wednesday. I did not know he had any\nconcerns at the time, but would have addressed them immediately if I had.\nI am sorry my actions invaded your privacy. This won't happen again. There are no audio or video surveillance devices inside or outside the Kirkland\nSent:01/17/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 07:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",

You respond to words you want me to have said so you can justify a fight. It’\ns unproductive. We have to go back and forth and show you I never said it, putting the real issue on pause.

I worked with Xfinity as noted, to make you as the sole owner of 1210, and made sure I moved\nDiamond status to your account. So did my best to set you up for success. And asked you to confirm you were happy with the new private set up.\nIt is approaching midnight. You stopped communicating and I still have no working bed to sleep on and no internet access. You have changed the\npassword and even though I’m listed as the owner now, I can’t get in because of the password change that you made. And they need to know why I\nwant to reverse something you did intentionally with them.\nI told you that you took over my account all afternoon. We have so many mails on it back and forth. You said you were working with fraud and it\nwould be 24-48 hours. I kept asking just to call me so we could tag team like we had successfully all day. I know this stuff. But you still refused.\nI made sure you were totally dialed in. Set up Lugg moves on the fly. You sent junk to my place after we agreed not to do that, sent me a bed that is flat\nso I can’t sleep on it, a TV you know I need the remote for and are the only with access to my WiFi. Sheesh Christine. You are actively monitoring me\nnow (and we know we both know how it works) and sleeping on my bed with me on a couch.\nTbh this is really messed up. Like what do I need to do to get my admin access back from you? I showed you everything today. And got you up and\nrunnjng after you screwed it all up not following simple directions. So you know how it all works now if you paid attention. And now you can see\neverything I do, just like you were complaining about with me.\nThe difference is you have done this willingly, knowingly, and in opposition to my asks. When we shared access that was voluntary on both parts,\nwhether you knew what you were doing or not.\nBut now you know!\nI don’t want to fight. I’ll work with you to get my physical and digital property, IP, and WiFi access back. But like the kids, I’m asking to work\ntogether. It’s not right for you just to steal it all from me, monitor me, and unilaterally control access to my digital life after making such a huge stink\nover this the last ten days. You have to see that, right?\nWe don’t need to have the attorneys for this. It’s common sense.

The giggles and jokes in the elevator seem like yesterday. I honestly thought we had battled back. To a\nplace of kindness and cooperation. Where we understood the finality of our situation as we emptied out the place where we shared so much. But we\nwere going to be kind, share grace. And work together to do the right thing, and make smart decisions. That is why I texted you my high hopes for a\nnew start.\nIs there any possible way, any way at all that we can take one day and just let this rest? Stop the fighting, lay down our arms, and maybe not find\nkindness, but at least find civility. There are so many hurt feelings for opportunities lost. But may we please pause for just a moment and take some\ntime before we make permanent decisions.

Ever...\nPer the attached, you and Anna Lisa are saying:\n- There is a Serious Concern for Safety: The court believes that there is a legitimate and convincing reason to be concerned for the safety of the\nprotected person. This is not a speculative or unfounded fear; it's based on credible evidence of similar incidents.\n- Physical Safety at Risk: The focus of this statement is on the physical safety of the protected persons. It demonstrates that the court has a real and\ndemonstrated reason to believe the restrained person will cause physical harm to the persons ordered to be protected.\n- Justification for Restraining Order: This finding is the key factor in the court's decision to issue the restraining order. It justifies the need for legal\nprotection because there is a clear and demonstrated pattern and history of physical abuse from the target of the order.\n- Increased Vigilance and Enforcement: With such a clause in place, law enforcement and the court are likely to be more vigilant in enforcing the\norder. Violations will be treated with greater seriousness given the perceived risk to physical health and safety of the protected.\n- Potential Impact on Other Provisions: This clause will influence other aspects of the restraining order, such as restrictions on proximity,\ncommunication restrictions, and other specific behaviors. The proven threat of bodily harm makes the request highly credible.\n- It's important the restrained person and the protected person understand the very serious implications of this clause. The restrained person must be\naware of the seriousness of the situation and the need to strictly adhere to the terms of the order to avoid legal consequences.\n- The protected person should understand they are asking for this level of risk mitigation and can demonstrate a history of this behavior so the court\ncan take all necessary precautions for the physical safety of those being protected given its likelihood of happening again.\nMessage 813 of 4024\nJust to reiterate, I am not trying to physically threaten you or the kids in any way as noted in the RO or with this communication. If you feel quoting\nthe RO you sent, along with the associated research, is a threat, please let me know immediately.\nIf so, I promise to address your concerns immediately with my attorney and the court to reassure you, the kids, and the court that I am not\nthreatening physical or sexual violence now, or ever. Even if you think it is likely to happen in the future.\nYou just asked me to \"Show me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers.\" So, I'm trying to accommodate my\ninterpretation of your ask, understanding you did this with your lawyer with a clear intent and purpose.\nI will never physically or sexually abuse you or my children.
