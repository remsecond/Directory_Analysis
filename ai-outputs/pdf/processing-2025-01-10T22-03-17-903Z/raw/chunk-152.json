You can say whatever you like, but it’s not what you said below.\nYou are certainly confirming you decided that youbare the sole decision maker for our children.\nTo keep this peaceful, I am again stating I dont agree with either of your statements or assumptions.\nI’ll also say one last time, we worked well together today. Now you are wasting both our time.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 562 of 4024\nHow do I get the account number without being able to get in. I’m getting frustrated so will step back. I’ve asked to help you so many times now. You\nrefuse to take it, even when I show you in front of your own eyes I can fix your problems safely, and have busted everything. It’s just frustrating,\nChristine.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 563 of 4024\nI’m stopping this thread as it’s a waste of my time.\nI would like to engage with Dr Brown. You want to discuss over the phone first. I disagree and believe we can align on email.\nIf/when you are ready, let me know to reach out or I will.
