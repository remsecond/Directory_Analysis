Apologies for that.\nBut we are where we are.\nToday the national semifinal game is on featuring Alabama v Michigan. If AD is not busy I am offering that he can come watch it and we work on\nour projects.\nI can pick up, bring home. Whatever. If you say no, that’s no. I am not arguing or expecting to be on here for anything else today. This is your time\nand I’ll respect that.\nThanks\nSent:01/01/2024 at 11:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/01/2024 at 12:18 PM)\nSubject:Alabama Game\nMessage 150 of 4024\nJust remembered that you said you wanted the kids so you could take them skiing today, so might not have access to this. I assume the backside is\nclosed so maybe so.\nEither way please do not alter your return plans in any way if the answer is yes. I don’t want to mess with your big ski day. But it is late in the\nafternoon so still works out.\nThanks\nSent:01/01/2024 at 12:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/01/2024 at 12:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alabama Game\nMessage 151 of 4024\nAdrian said yes. I’m driving Max to tusker now so Adrian is home for pick up.\nCan you drop off before 4:30. There are plans to watch Huskys game tonight at Dylan’s.\nSent:01/01/2024 at 12:20 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/01/2024 at 12:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alabama Game\nMessage 152 of 4024\nSo...\nthe games go back to back with a delay in between.
