  "text": "Message 95 of 4024\nLet’s finalize parenting plan today.\nYou can schedule a time to pick up any items you feel you need immediately while 2 and 3 are pending.\nI am urgently requesting you move on.\nTo reiterate, I said we could have finalized parenting plan in Sept but we agreed to get professional input. I am not the hold up.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:10 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 96 of 4024\nYou tell me a time. I am done with your snarky comments.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Final Draft Review\nMessage 97 of 4024\nI am not going to even dignify your mischaracterization with a response. I sent multiple plans. Just send me a single one you proposed and we can put\nthat discussion to bed.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 98 of 4024\nThis is not working. I will send my proposed  parenting plan to my lawyer by end of week so you should have it next week.\nDebbie can attest that I said I could finalize without input and you definitely said no.\nI am logging off this app and nothing more to discuss.\nI will drop off Adrian on Saturday morning at 9am.\nThat’s it from me.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:15 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:16 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup",
