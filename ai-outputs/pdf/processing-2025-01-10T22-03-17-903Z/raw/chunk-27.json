Thanks for the partnership!\nSent:12/28/2023 at 02:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 02:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 116 of 4024\nI was thinking about not being able to shoot for an hour while you were at work tomorrow. And I realize during the school year, that’s the schedule.\nSo no issues. It’s your time.\nThen our plan says: “Spring Break and Winter Break should be alternated via even and odd years so that each parent has one of the breaks every year.”\nWe are on winter break.\nThen for the actual holiday event we rotate Eve vs. Day. But given the plan, it seems I am getting the school allotted days while they are on break. Is\nthat intentional?\nTBH- spring and winter are nowhere near the same (I think) so not sure the plan really accounts for our real world. And next winter I don’t really\nexpect two full weeks - Xmas day.\nIt just seems ill conceived and we are making up some weird hybrid. Most importantly - I AM NOT bitching. This is not a knock. You have been very\nhelpful. But it’s not the plan, right?\nPlease, please, don’t take it as fighting or snarky. Just tell me I’m wrong if you think I am. But the first pass through the calendar is going to be a\nlearning experience for us.\nThank you!\nSent:12/28/2023 at 04:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Winter Break (not urgent)\nMessage 117 of 4024\nThat was part of the plan I planned to discuss with you. Given we are in Phase 1, I don’t believe that counts yet but we can debate more in the call\ntomorrow at 9am.\nMax is definitely something we need to discuss given the reunification therapy.\nAnyway. Let’s save for tomorrow discussion as we will not solve on this thread tonight.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 05:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 05:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Winter Break (not urgent)",
