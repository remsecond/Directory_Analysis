This is exactly what we saw with Max and she told you Max is scared if you and needed reunification therapy.\nI would be happy for Adrian to share his concerns with her then we decide what’s best.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 02:58 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 491 of 4024\nI can’t do it. I block because of your behaviour and makes me feel unsafe\nSent:01/17/2024 at 02:58 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 492 of 4024\nCan we start with a little transparency with the person who supposedly did the act?\nIf you recall Max is a liar. You are the one who confirmed it. You said you never told him that you were divorcing me while you were in Hong Kong.\nYou said it was a lie. And I sure as hell know, as do you I NEVER beat that kid at 2,3,4 or later in Mexico.\nYou just don’t get it. You have vilified the fuck out of me. They still don’t have a separation story. How fucked up is that? They just know Mom is\nthis omnipotent ruler who took Dads wife, kids, friends, and house with his livelihood on the blocks next.\nThis is so wrong.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 03:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 493 of 4024\nI stuck to our rules. Please don’t create situations that don’t exist. Please unblock and we will stick to the rules again. You blocked because you were\npissed, not because I broke the rules. Please afford us urgent and/or emergency coms.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 03:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 494 of 4024\nI will not respond to any comms that is not urgent or an emergency.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 03:15 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki",
