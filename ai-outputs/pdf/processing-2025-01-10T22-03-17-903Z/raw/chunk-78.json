It is my understanding of the current situation. But I’m not a lawyer. It was also a plea to work together so we made\nsmart fiscal decisions for the long term. My offer still stands>>\nHey-\nI was thinking about what you said about us drawing down your assets since you make more money than I do now even though we continue to pull\nfrom Fidelity the same way we always did to cover the gaps.\nHypothetically Speaking:\n- Let's say I made 5x what you made over 24 years (it was definitely more, given the stock market returns we have seen)\n- In the last year, we got my full 10-month payout, one month of vacation, and now unemployment checks. No bonus or stock.\nAs I understand in community property states, any income earned by either spouse during the marriage and all property bought with those earnings is\nconsidered community property, owned equally by both spouses. Likewise, our debts incurred during our marriage are shared debts. So while I was\nthe primary breadwinner for 24 years and am now unemployed and drawing benefits that are a fraction of your income, the wealth accumulated\nduring the years when I was the primary earner is considered joint property, regardless of who earned more. So when it comes time for us to divide\nassets, the law would look for a fair distribution that considers the entire marriage span, not just the current earning situation. So that's the 24 years I\nwas the primary breadwinner as well as the last few months you were.\nBut what I heard you say is you think you are paying all the bills now because you are the primary earner while we draw from our shared investments\n(which are 1/2 yours). So, given the status quo, how do you think that you are disproportionately contributing to our marital assets? I can understand\nyour perception from an emotional standpoint, but I don't think it aligns with the legal view of community property. Just like I can't say I was paying\nfor everything for the previous 24 years. It might feel unfair given our recent shift in financial dynamics, but I don't get how it's different with you as\nthe main breadwinner, even if the change in our roles feels abrupt or unbalanced. I feel like we just swapped roles for the last couple of months\n(though I don't think you make 4-8x what I did given my payout and unemployment benefits)\nYou worked to make us an effective team, and we could not have accumulated our nest egg without your contributions to our household. Those let\nSent:01/07/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 06:32 PM)\nSubject:You demanded I “Get a Job” and left....",
