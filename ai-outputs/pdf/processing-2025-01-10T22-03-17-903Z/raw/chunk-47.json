Yes, I've been talking to him about all the issues for a while (especially friends). I've tried\nto share with you. But sure, lets chat.\nI am concerned that introducing a new school when he has no idea even what his own parents are doing, might be a tricky time. The poor dude has no\nsafe harbor in the storm anymore.\nPlease don't take any of this as a knock on you. I'm just very concerned for him these days.\nSent:01/01/2024 at 09:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/01/2024 at 09:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian School (not urgent)\nMessage 169 of 4024\nI have not confirmed time yet.
