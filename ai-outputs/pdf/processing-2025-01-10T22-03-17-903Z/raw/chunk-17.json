I really want to approach with care however so he is not in an awkward situation between us.\nMaybe like “Hey Bro- think about dinner tonight at xyz, wanna join or if you have plans, that’s cool too. We will try again another time. No worries”\nThat way he has an out already built in - prior plans. So he does not feel pressured to say yes. Just looking for honest feedback. That is all!\nGood luck today!\nSent:12/27/2023 at 07:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Wed & Holiday Time\nMessage 74 of 4024\nThat’s fine\nSent:12/27/2023 at 07:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Wed & Holiday Time\nMessage 75 of 4024\nSuper!

We cannot return damaged goods. So we are out $650 or so. I’ll see if I can use it.\nIt’s a really nice device. Just damaged now.\nSent:12/27/2023 at 01:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 01:40 PM)\nSubject:Xmas Gift\nAttachments:IMG_0708.jpg (2 MB)",
