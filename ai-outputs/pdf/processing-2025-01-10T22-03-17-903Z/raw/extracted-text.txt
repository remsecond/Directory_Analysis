Yes, that is what we said. Let's try 9:00 if that works for pick-up.
Are we going to discuss settings here and expectations? Or did you do all of that? Who else has access to this? We should probably both align on what
you did, agree?

You ignored my question about discussing the settings and how this is used both here and in text. And I don’t know what to expect wrt response
time. I have zero info on this all or the way you set it up. When you want to discuss we can move back to it. Till then, I’m out! Thanks!

Please refer to Dr Brown communication guidelines and response timelines and expectations. I did not adjust any settings.
I am not going to revert to a communication method that has proven volatile for you.
If you refuse to use this service, please suggest an alternative. This was the service your lawyer suggested as well and you signed up for in September.

That’s a pretty toxic response. All I asked was the info you just provided. That seems easy. But you choose to ignore it in two places and then go to
blast. In the future it might be easier just to answear a simple question than to start making assumptions and making demands.
Any chance we can actually agree to read each other’s question and see if we can just answer it first next time? I think that was Dr Browns suggestion
today as well. Behaving the exact same way, just on another platform won’t really buy us much. Let’s make this work together!
Thanks!

We have put our discussion off for quite a while now. Including our running list. You pushed it till after yesterday so let me know when you want to
have it.
It won’t be f2f and we should both be in a space we can be kind and willing to show grace. We finally have something in place so hope that helps us

Ok. I honestly feel like anything, no matter what that I suggest, that will show the kids something positive, is always a hard no. No matter what.
Do you ever have plans to show any conflict resolution and civility? I am really hoping we work back to the Alyssa model someday.
But I’m honestly concerned you have cast me as such an irredeemable villain to everyone that you can’t show anything else and save face.
I guess we should be honest if we even share goals of healing and civility or if we are always going to be hateful and demeaning to each other.
And I’m not at all looking to debate it on Xmas eve. I’m just looking for a truthful answer because if it takes time, fine. But “never” is not healthy.

And I updated you every step of the way to be sure we were still on the same page. Since we swap I’ll take a stab at the odd year.
Christine:
- All of December break
- Luxury trip to Cali and Universal Studios
- Christmas Eve with Rudolph’s
- Xmas morning with never noted gifts
Robert:
- Encore Xmas morning
I’ll figure out to ask “just the right question” someday. Because I clearly noted that the kids Xmas should start much earlier. That is important to
them. I’m their Dad, I know that. So I’m glad that you could swoop in and do it for them at least. I’ll be ready for Act II.

that.
The platform won’t matter if you are always dishonest. They say lying is hard because you always have to remember what you said. You can make it
easier on both of us by being honest. Then there are zero messages to try and figure out the truth. Can we just start there and see how it goes?

We agree. I think we need to dial it WAY back.
Hopefully it was just because there was so much planning and details we did not think about. I think it will behoove us to really be sure we include as
much needed info in the first back and forth, rather than a death by a 1k cuts, fine tuning later.
We have the right tool, let’s learn how to use it right and use it to our mutual advantage. I’m also learning more about things like the “tone meter” and
scheduling. I’ll share in one go instead of piecemeal as I was tempted to do initially.
If there is an emergency I’ll text you. Otherwise I don’t plan to be pinging you here during my time. Thanks!

You are suggesting to bring him back to the Kirkland home with no time stated and that you need packages that I do not see. You saw my message and
chose not to respond.
Dr. Brown suggested no pick ups and drop off at residences. You are located in an apartment tower so there is not a threat of me entering your
residence. You are stating you will come directly to the house which I do not agree to.
I will move this to lawyers as this is not working and you are not following Dr. Brown guidelines

I will not replying to this point by point. When I do, it seems to always make the matter worse. We have different perspectives and I do not wish to
inflame either our relationship or this situation. And I certainly don’t want a repeat of what just transpired.
We had a plan. It worked yesterday and came off the rails during pick up. We honestly don’t need to argue or expose the children to adult situations.
Maybe thats where we start? But I think it’s about getting back to the way we worked together yesterday.
We will chat later before 1:00 as agreed. So let me know when. My humble suggestion is that you let me know what you want and expect to make this
a healthy relationship for the kids. And even us. We need tools in our box more than ever before.
I promise to bring a healthy, optimistic, can do attitude to our discussion. I also assure you that nothing that happened in the past will be used as
material- no retribution. I only want to sincerely and calmly discuss moving forward. Golden Rule!

Yes... did you see the other thread? I want to be sure if we communicate it’s civil and productive. I’m not trying to control you. I am only asking that
we start any communication without disagreeing or arguing about things that are in the past. Where we both have a lot of hurt. That is better left for
the therapy that Dr Brown recommended. Not amateurs like us.

We had a great discussion today. We made a great plan. Let’s stick with it even if it hit a speed bump. Let’s not talk about the past (that includes
today). Let’s put this behind us and do the best we can by the kids and each other. The golden rule- do unto others, even if it means starting this

After thinking about this more, I realize that you were

about swinging his Xbox over. You were not there.
I get our history might have lead to a conflict. But, we have a plan now. Me micromanaging what you do with your time is not permitted. I can
sympathize with why you would think I would complain, but I assure you that I am not going to do that. It is your time.
If I give you grief moving forward, please let me know immediately. I will course correct. I honestly was only bothered that you were not being

him an unbudgeted $650 unless we want him to learn a hard lesson.
Either way you might say something to him and say we will let it slide this time but it’s a costly goof. I’ll see if I can use it for something creative so it’s

1 Dialectical Behavioral Therapy program
- Christine will participate for at least 6 months
- Robert will participate for 12 months
Resources: Eastside DBT, Thira, EBT Seattle, and the Seattle Clinic are good options.
Notes: We can talk about if we do it at the same place. Does not need to be same person.
2 Marriage counseling
- Christine and Robert- Not to stay together, but to peacefully coexist for the kid's sake.
Resources: We can consider Debbie or someone else.
Notes: Important to get the details from Dr Brown. Let's discuss how to do that.
3 Child Therapy
- Max and Adrian should go to this as soon as possible. Therapist should have the final parenting plan.
Resources: Kari Betts is who I have reached out to or someone else.
Notes: Let's decide if we want to go with her.
4 Substance Use Counseling
- Christine should be allowed a session with a substance use professional
- Robert goes once per week with a provider who specializes in working with addiction
Resources: New Life or perhaps one of the places where we do DBT since they coexist so often
Notes: Robert to investigate and talk to Christine
5 Child Led Reunification Therapy
- Robert, Max and Adrian
Resources: None suggested
Notes: Perhaps we ask Dr Brown or Kari Betts for recommendations.

Boys spring break is aligned this year. The room is booked for April 6 - 13.

how do boys feel safe in a foreign country with no ability to escape, if your anger, or sobriety where to relapse.

I’ll review Dr. Brown guidelines but she had expected response time in there. It feels like you are tracking when I read the emails and then expecting an

I was thinking about not being able to shoot for an hour while you were at work tomorrow. And I realize during the school year, that’s the schedule.
So no issues. It’s your time.
Then our plan says: “Spring Break and Winter Break should be alternated via even and odd years so that each parent has one of the breaks every year.”
We are on winter break.
Then for the actual holiday event we rotate Eve vs. Day. But given the plan, it seems I am getting the school allotted days while they are on break. Is
that intentional?
TBH- spring and winter are nowhere near the same (I think) so not sure the plan really accounts for our real world. And next winter I don’t really
expect two full weeks - Xmas day.
It just seems ill conceived and we are making up some weird hybrid. Most importantly - I AM NOT bitching. This is not a knock. You have been very
helpful. But it’s not the plan, right?
Please, please, don’t take it as fighting or snarky. Just tell me I’m wrong if you think I am. But the first pass through the calendar is going to be a
learning experience for us.
Thank you!

I’ve been thinking about this more and have some ideas of how we might do this. It will require you to help and even some teamwork, but if you

I’d like to share them with you tomorrow and hope you will approach with an open mind with a goal of getting the entire family a bit more “re-
unified” since the events of July 5th.
This has been a real struggle and has only gotten worse, but given we know we are getting a divorce and will lead separate lives, I hope we can do right
be the kids and each other and take a healthy approach once the parenting plan is in place.

Lots of staring at the ceiling last night.
I am admittedly scared of our conversation this AM and assume you have some concerns as well. I am
admitting I am powerless and am praying to my higher power to show me the way to have a peaceful and constructive conversation this morning,
being thoughtful with my actions and words, and treating you with the respect and dignity you deserve.
This, while I ask for grace, cooperation, and maybe even some measure of forgiveness that should not be afforded to me. I pray that we find a way for
that being clear eyed that forgiveness does not mean forgetting. And in our case, it specifically means that destructive words and deeds are never
appropriate, normalized, or permitted again.
I promise I will try and do my best by you and the family as we have a difficult conversation in an effort to start a long healing process and
reunification together. I pray my thoughts and words are guided with best intentions rather than self service, in the best interest of all. I wish you the
best and that your higher power guides you in the way that is right and appropriate for you as well.

We are aligned on phase 1 so no need to accelerate discussions. Frankly I agree with Dr Brown and we cease verbal communication and we need to
adjust communication on this platform as well.
The three emails you sent clearly escalate in tone and none require immediate response.
I’ll confer with my lawyer on Tuesday on suggestions for modifications but this clearly is not working and does not prevent you from behavior that is

————————————————————————
Christine-
Please take a look at the attachment. If we have agreed on Phase I, that is great. Let's go ahead and move forward. I have updated the doc with "track
changes" turned on.
Obviously, we are not at all in agreement for Phase II. Specifically, if the best I can even do is 65/35 for AD with zero guaranteed for Max. And
unnecessary disruption for them.
I also never get a real vacation in your plan, as it has to be within Uber distance. Spring Break will give you Hong Kong, California Theme Parks, and
Cabo all in a row with Mom.
Perhaps the easiest way to review is to start by accepting changes, looking at the way it reads to assure you are OK with the suggested updates, and
seeing notes on the side.
I'm looking forward to your feedback so we can send the areas of disagreement to Dr. Brown. She can provide suggestions for mutually disappointing
tiebreaks, and we move forward.

You always have an excuse. For everything. If you can’t make time to have a talk about our child given the way he has responded to this situation
forget it. If you really don’t see a problem here that we urgently need professional help with I don’t know what to do.
Your way has not worked since Yurushaka when we promised to talk about discernment. Please recognize history for a moment and consider if we
have a problem we should address constructively. We used to work together even after this started. It worked.
Then you started shutting down our efforts. Stopping any help to understand the other’s perspective, or heal. Creating a destructive self fulfilling
prophecy of disaster. It’s not working. It’s getting worse. Please consider working with me before the courts make us.
Today this all started when I tried to do you a favor. Then another. Then you insult me and start a fight. I’m sure I do that crap as well to you. But we
should learn how to step back, own our own self-determination. And stop. But we really need help to do that.
I was dark all weekend so this would not happen. But we will have to talk sometime. Like we should for Max’s mental health. This is a very high stakes
game. Let’s please treat it with the care and respect it deserves. So we can talk about our kids mental health.

- we have heard different things each time
- we choose the one that we each want to hear
- none of it is working and we are ignoring that
So what is the definition of insanity?
Why are you fighting against trying to learn to work together? Really? Is it for appearances to someone else? Is it pride? It’s not working. It’s our kids

Thank you again for the flexibility. AD and I are having a blast. You said you had to change plans and I want
to acknowledge your kindness. I promise to return the favor and appreciate you leading by example.
The game is SUPER slow. So many freaking commercials. It’s worse than the superbowl it seems. Either way, UW starts at 5:45. But as soon as this is
done I’ll get him over to the party for act II!

Hi Robert,
I’d like to discuss Adrian’s school situation and his ongoing unhappiness at ICS. We have had conversations over the past few months in regards to his
experience and I am increasingly concerned for what he expresses to me.
Options
1) See if he can transfer to SAAS this school year
2) Apply to SAAS for grade 7
3) transfer him to Kirkland Middle school this school year or for grade 7.
It is clear to me ICS is not a good fit and am worried the longer he stays in that system, the more frustrated he becomes.
Option 1 and 2 are certainly pricey but I’d like to seriously consider it. I was going to bring it up once there was more certainty on the job front on
your end, but after a conversation we had tonight I don’t believe I can wait any longer.
Let me know a good time to connect on this, this week.
Thank you
Christine

I am concerned that introducing a new school when he has no idea even what his own parents are doing, might be a tricky time. The poor dude has no
safe harbor in the storm anymore.
Please don't take any of this as a knock on you. I'm just very concerned for him these days.

Christine, it’s kind of an issue for me. I think in our parenting plan it discusses undermining each other. And that includes too friends of our child’s
parents. Specifically in this case, you lied to me and you told me that you had not told our deepest and dearest friends of 16 years. But I found out
when they texted me about how I was doing. You always lie about anything that you want but then have a clever excuse that it’s all justified. So when
you are violating the terms of our parenting plan, undermining me as it stipulates not to, and lying about it, that becomes an issue for me.

I do not want to argue with you. We had a plan to nest. Period. That was our plan of record. You decided that Yurushka’s label was appropriate and I
won’t argue that point or the change in perspective.
But prior to that, whatever we had then, it was ok to nest. But you have changed your mind. That is fine. But I understand our history, it’s and our
evolution so to me it’s still confusing. But I accept that.
Yes. Divorce is expensive. I hope we can get a handle on our relationship well enough to work collaboratively together. I want to partner with you so
please let me know how to do you feel safe.

I do not. I agree. And I don’t agree that I asked you to hide anything. If our relationship was not normal for 29 years, I would have expected a
conversation.
But I don’t want to fight. Period. I’d like to understand it better as we had planned to do, but am willing to wait on your timeline. That’s most
important now.
Just because you decide to change your perspective, did not mean I stopped wanting to improve and be the best husband and father I could be to us.

I recognize that the other thread has some triggering language and topics. I want to be sensitive to that. You have made a request of me of what not to

I am happy to explore spaces like that under the watchful eye of a professional and welcome that. But till then I’d like to steer clear and be respectful
of things that might give you anxiety or cause you to feel triggered. I’m trying here. 
You are working. I realize this is the exact kind of thing we are trying to avoid, so am not looking for anything else from you so you can focus and be

Please do. I’m trying to figure out what he is exposed to for his own mental health. DV was never in our vocabulary at 47 and 56 unless I was cooking
sausages for the ladies breakfast.
Then Yurushka introduced the label it and it has driven almost everything in our life for the last six months. Why would he be asking about that? It’s
adult business he shouldn’t be exposed to.

Both kids were witness to it Robert during their entire lives.
To be exact about when I know for certain Adrian heard the term is below on Wednesday September 13. I have contemporaneous notes from that
day. You left for Oregon for our safety. Below is a recap.
I tried to leave the home in the car as you were acting unsafe and irrational and snatched my phone away from me. More details can be provided if
needed. As you were blocking me from leaving the house from the car, Adrian came and started using his safe word with me. What followed is I
escaped from you and left  through the front door. You chased me out of the house and started yelling “you are a domestic violence abuser” loudly.
That is when Lisa drove by in her car and removed me from the situation. I texted the kids to meet me at her place.

I said that he said “DV” . He did not translate what you believe happened to the two letter acronym. Which even in your story does not note. How

The larger point is, and I’m tired of fighting with you as you justify your destruction and smear campaign (including with the parents of our kids
friends l) on me. You are doing it and are dishonest about it.
It’s simply not in the kids interest to portray me as a monster to them or to our long long time friends. We have a plan. Let’s stop the character
assassination and recognize it’s better for our kids mental health.
I’m not going to argue with you here today. I want to start doing right by the kids. I always build you up to them. I want them to look up to, respect,

I am hoping that in cases where you are itching for a fight, but still wait till the next day to unleash, that we can just put that hate on ice instead of
ruining another day straight from the get go. It’s a new day.
Now we will have all day trying to grapple with the crap we could have dealt with before bed but decided to kick off the day with. My suspicion is

It was probably one of the best ever, tbh. Really an awesome day. AD is just amazing. And I really love coaching his team. I’m in my element. For that
matter, I’ve turned a corner I think. I look great, feel great, and we have a parenting plan so all my big problems are solved.
That said, I did miss your voice on this special day for the first time in 29 years. Even when we talked late at night from River Oaks Parkway to
Seymour Road. There will be a lot of firsts in our ending. That’s fine. But tbh, I still love some part of you. I don’t feel bad about it either.
And you say I don’t have that kind of access to you, so that is fine. But when I pledged to love you till death do us part, I meant it. And I still do. And
even though you hate everything about me, I know in my heart I never held malice for you. I learned wrong. Not an excuse, a reality.
I’m not asking you for anything. And I’m entitled to my own feelings and my own reality. It’s me that we
are talking about after all. And I know more about the how, why, and intent of my actions than anyone, even you. So I’m ok telling you I know my
truth. And we can both be right.
Hope when things get better I can have a rain check on my bday dinner. It would be nice to break bread with an old friend who I shared so many of
these days with in the past. Till then, I’ll do my best with this new opportunity and move the hell on with my life. Unexplained as it is.

not involved, but I asked you to be involved. I am doing that again. Would you like to be involved?
Message 260 of 4024
You are sending me blackmailing texts.
You signed a lease yesterday for 6.800 without consultation and communicated it’s all community property and within your rights to commit me to a
spend for my half without my input.
Threatening me that you will make unilateral decisions because I will not respond to your blackmail threatening texts is your choice.
I do not plan to respond to any more emails, texts, calls or this platform as I feel threatened.

As I have mentioned many times before. On several platforms now, I’d like your feedback on a 9 or 12 month lease. I am asking you directly again,
just like I have been for days. I’m not trying to fight you.
And I am not escalating. I am also not addressing what you are saying below. I don’t believe that to be true but you’re free to say what you want.
Do you want to be involved in the term of the lease decision or not?

Ok... fyi I was able to talk him into 9 months with month to month after. I’d like 12, I’m so tired

I’m really trying, Christine, I’m just done waiting. On a place to live, getting my stuff, getting a parenting plan for our kids. everything that allows me
to move on. Everywhere you’re blocking me from doing it.
And while I sympathize that you ALWAYS say you have no time, but make time for new relationships while your kids don’t even know about the
divorce and I’m totally blocked, my sympathy runs thin.
You have made zero effort for the kids therapy, or the the work we are supposed to be doing. It’s awesome you’re putting yourself first, but please
start making some time to clean up the wreckage you are creating.
Forget about me. You hate me.

ACK on AD, thank you. I’ll do my best and communicate with him.
I have LUGGs lined up for this week Mon-Wed to start uncoupling. My plan is to move consistent with our shared email.
There may still some fine tuning (example: I think Max uses the stair master to train)  but I’ll stick to the confirmed items. It will likely be a couple of
weeks to complete but it’s a start.
I hope that you are pleased I negotiated a 9 month lease. Very few places will do that but I made it clear that was the reason this place was even in
consideration.
So while it may bother you, I am tried my best and it’s a competitive rent in this market. And it’s near you, a SAAS bustop, and the kids should
approve of the space.
I’d also like to make some purchase descriptions today. (Example: ScanPan, Linens, Towels, organizing stuff- Kitchen and closet, etc...) I think we
agreed for some of these we both need a refresh. In other cases we can either split, or purchase new and have two separate sets. I am happy and would
prefer collaboration.
I am trying to work constructively with you to extricate myself from any area of your life that is not necessary. Every cross word about who is doing
what on a Eastside place is likely washed breath. It will be resolved by someone else in the future. So let’s just start trying to work together in a positive
way with a shared goal.
Please do reply. It’s so hard to communicate sometimes and you have called it out as well. I’m not debating the platforms right now. I’m talking about
this message and this topic on OFW.

I may try and change the Wednesday LUGG to be a bigger truck so we can reduce trips. But sharing what I have booked now.
We will probably swap some stuff (mattresses,
living room set for study?) And neither of us want the table and chairs.
But that can wait for a v.next plans discussion. I think the goal right now should be to get to a reasonable and functional state.

Yes, makes sense. No need to set up a couch move.

I’ll spend some time mapping out all the details as I understand. And the logistics to tonight. Then we can go over it together. Then we can decide if
we want to fill holes with CL or Fernish or whatever we find.
Then we can say “let’s both budget $ for mutual xyz and stay in each other’s ball park. Example: Sitting Room- Mine will double as an office. But I’m
not going to dupe yours now. That would be nuts.
Or... if we see something we love and must have that is beyond a shared budget, then perhaps we tell each other and say “ok, get whatever you want,
but it’s your 50/50 later”. But that is earmarked as a spend.
I don’t think either of us would do that without knowing if the next 20 years we are both living in  separate but duplicate lives in our own 1.3k square
foot apartment. But we may. This is tough for sure.

<<I sent this to you in October. It is my understanding of the current situation. But I’m not a lawyer. It was also a plea to work together so we made
smart fiscal decisions for the long term. My offer still stands>>
Hey-
I was thinking about what you said about us drawing down your assets since you make more money than I do now even though we continue to pull
from Fidelity the same way we always did to cover the gaps.
Hypothetically Speaking:
- Let's say I made 5x what you made over 24 years (it was definitely more, given the stock market returns we have seen)
- In the last year, we got my full 10-month payout, one month of vacation, and now unemployment checks. No bonus or stock.
As I understand in community property states, any income earned by either spouse during the marriage and all property bought with those earnings is
considered community property, owned equally by both spouses. Likewise, our debts incurred during our marriage are shared debts. So while I was
the primary breadwinner for 24 years and am now unemployed and drawing benefits that are a fraction of your income, the wealth accumulated
during the years when I was the primary earner is considered joint property, regardless of who earned more. So when it comes time for us to divide
assets, the law would look for a fair distribution that considers the entire marriage span, not just the current earning situation. So that's the 24 years I
was the primary breadwinner as well as the last few months you were.
But what I heard you say is you think you are paying all the bills now because you are the primary earner while we draw from our shared investments
(which are 1/2 yours). So, given the status quo, how do you think that you are disproportionately contributing to our marital assets? I can understand
your perception from an emotional standpoint, but I don't think it aligns with the legal view of community property. Just like I can't say I was paying
for everything for the previous 24 years. It might feel unfair given our recent shift in financial dynamics, but I don't get how it's different with you as
the main breadwinner, even if the change in our roles feels abrupt or unbalanced. I feel like we just swapped roles for the last couple of months
(though I don't think you make 4-8x what I did given my payout and unemployment benefits)
You worked to make us an effective team, and we could not have accumulated our nest egg without your contributions to our household. Those let

me focus on a high-paying job and make great investment choices in the market and real estate. But in a community asset state, the 50/50 model
doesn't change even when our roles are reversed. So your current earnings, my payout, and my unemployment benefits are just part of our marital
estate. So if we are currently drawing from our joint income and investments to pay our bills, why would it be viewed as drawing solely from your
earnings? Till we divvy everything up, everything is still the same, right? It's just you have been contributing more these last few months. The same
way I did for the last 24 years is the way that I interpret what is going on now.
Definitely not trying to argue. It's just how I interpret community property until we go our own way after the divorce. And as I mentioned today, I
really hope we learn to be civil enough to effectively partner with financial professionals to make the best long-term decisions as a team (we both have
a good head on our shoulders). Especially when it comes to things like "when to sell what" wrt stock to pay the least amount of taxes as our brackets
evolve and change. Of course, the same goes for the house and condo sale. Given the interest rate hell we are going to be dealing with, essentially
forgoing all that we tried to do, we may not be able to reasonably buy homes for years to come. Divorces are utterly devastating to retirement plans
along with future quality of life, given the self-inflicted opportunity costs.

I have replied on the original. I would like to go back to Phase I guidelines. On both sides. If either is in violation we make a decision. Can we agree
rather than going to the lawyers? I am agreeing to follow guidelines as well. Let’s don’t escalate. Thanks!

The net is it’s more expensive but your cool with that, but also may take longer. So want you to be aware it may be later for AD pick up. That said, it

<< Please wait till you can take a moment and really read this. I know I send you a lot of emails, but this is actually meaningful >>
Today you said something critically important to closing out our relationship in a more timely way with less acrimony, possibly setting us up to teach
the kids something valuable as a life skill.
The “two things can be right” recap:
1) You could not let me know what was really going on because you thought I would be trigged. It was a safety thing in your mind, and you had no
choice.
2) I was getting an overwhelmingly positive signal. I agree you said things had to change and I thought they had. I believed I had listened and done
what you asked.
It was an impossible dilemma. A catch 22. There are nuances and blame we both would like to disproportionally heap on each other because of the
awful situation. And neither of us wants to bear the burden of blowing up our family.
But I have no desire to fight about that. We are not in a safe enough space to play with that fire yet. In good time after some healing apart we can
consider it.
But today you said “I want to tell you something I have never told you before, I endured this for twice as long as you and I have never even had a
moment to process”... and it made me think- this is so much more than just me involved.
I have always made the assumption you were full steam ahead. Happy about it all and loving your decision. No concerns, you won the lottery with
that July 5th call- No more Big. And tbh I don’t see the collateral damage weighing on you in the least.
So what? Here’s what- the last six months have been sheer unadulterated hell. We have compounded our problem 10x fold. And we created our own
ever worsening self fulfilling prophecy of literal doom. And we are spiraling out of control.
We can’t turn back time. Too much blood has been shed to forget. But, we still control our future. And we know now so much left unsaid has done
so much damage, that we should consider doing something different moving forward.
In your moment of transparency and honesty I honestly understood where you were coming from. I get it. Finally a window into the black box of
inexplicable despair that I needed desperately to understand. I even think we have a lot in common.
These moments, these hard, honest truths, if we open up, like we have not before, will allow us to be relatable and show vulnerability to each others
perspective. We don’t have to be right, we just have to make an effort to understand each other.

But to this point we have each dug in hard. There is only one POV, it’s mine, and it’s right! But that never really works. And it has proven to be even
more destructive than the original sin that got us into this place. We are repeating the pattern.
But I hope, that the two people who raised three kids and dreamed of forever can find the time to start communicating again. Perhaps show some
humanity for each other. And agree this was not on purpose. Blaming each other will never help us.
We had our reasons for making the decisions we did. But we see now that they were driven by bad data and incorrect assumptions. We stopped
communicating and got it all wrong.
I’ve made my point. And because I’m learning, and trying to get better now that I know, I am not asking for anything. I just wanted to share my
perspective.
It is my hope however that after 30 years of doing a bad job on both sides of being honest and compassionate, that we consider creating a safe place.
One that helps us understand how we got here, in the hope we never do it again.
You are our cycle breaker. The hero! We have a plan now to course correct- every problem we had but this one. Lets not throw it away or minimize
this. Let’s take advantage of your bravery. Let’s put something positive together that leaves us with a legacy we can both be proud of and we take
forward as a win.
Let’s start with compassion for what the other is feeling and not start by blaming, let’s communicate honestly with each other again,  let’s give each
other the space to heal separately without constructing a wall. And in good time let’s find a safe space and setting to compare notes and start to heal.

Today was a shit ton of work. Tomorrow will be the same. I’m done for the night trying to sort and organize and it will be a repeat tomorrow and go

I’m going to cancel Wed/Thurs appointments and sort things before I throw more into the equation. We can swap bed sets next week. I’ll just use the
beach couch to save money and then think about a decent kitchen table and chairs instead.
Then maybe we move the beach table and chairs over to the garage instead of the couch as we had considered at the same time we swap beds. Please
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I can address.
I feel like you are being a great partner in this effort and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. We will all be much happier when we are settled and
only need to work together on basic, regular kid stuff. I can’t wait!

the week.
She also sees us laying out cash because of our divorce now that I have a reasonable place. But this is our retirement not a pile of money that is a first

I’ll also be taking stuff from the house today. I’ve done a decent job prepping AD that we are a team on this effort. But in absence of a discussion I

But I do need some reassurance. I am working my ass off and trying to do right by you. I am giving it my level best to set us up for success by
extricating myself from your space which will limit the acrimony from continuous property conversations. I am trying to help our relationship
improve.
What I cannot stand is repeating recent history and the explosion of our marriage. I am asking you be 100% honest with me at this moment. We are
working well together, and it hopefully is the start of things to come. But if you are just going to tell me later, you did this to get me the fuck out of
your life so you can move to something new before we close this out, it will be too much for me.
I like the way this is. I want to continue. This way has so much potential. But we know the excuses of the past and the devastation it caused us and so
many people who depend on us. Please tell me if you are being honest with me now, or if this is just a show again because you think I will be triggered
otherwise. I have to know this time, now that I have learned my lesson the hard way.

I don’t control your behavior and I must act and respond accordingly. There are consequences to any actions you and I take. We need to own that.
Once you and your lawyer have had time to digest, I’m sure you will formulate a response.
I believe you likely know the issue but probably did not think through the consequences and fall out. Maybe you did and just did not care.

If Adrian has any concerns they should not come through you. I am more than happy to address with him directly or with you there. As I have asked
to do for months now, but you have refused. But acting as the gatekeeper for conversations about me to the kids as you have done since July when

This should probably be a separate thread...
I’d like to chat with you at some point when you feel comfortable in the future. Not about this. More about how the two people in June turned into
January. It’s in no way about blame or finger pointing. It is more an acknowledgment of both our deep shared disappointment. In ourselves for
waiting so long, and each other as we try to find blame for a lost dream shared. Based on what I’ve learned, it’s an absolutely logical evolution from
deep love to the acidic hate we share now. It is a testament to how true our affection was for each other. Unfortunately, we now see that same flame
burns equally hot on both sides of hope and disappointment. It’s likely not going to solve anything, but a deeper understanding of the human
condition might ease our mind and help us make more compassionate decisions. After all, they say that the “truth will set you free.”
As I mentioned, clearly not for now. But please let me know when you might consider some reflection.

Ok.. I have tried to get a head start on a possible next LUGG move on Monday per your request. I have included the items you noted yesterday and
replied with an update to our "Dad on the Eastside" email.
I want to be sensitive to your platform asks but feel like the email format is going to serve us better for the fine tuning so have sent a much more
legible version to your Hotmail. For your records and consistency.
I am also copying and pasting the same content here, but it will not be easy to track or understand inline comments. Frankly, it is a mess so I hope we
can use both platforms appropriately. Thanks!
------------------------Start of email------------------------------------------------
There is a lot of stuff here. I don't think it will all make it. If you can look through this list. Let me know what you think. If we agree, I can distill it
into one manageable, prioritized list to share and agree to. I appreciate the help and cooperation. Getting our homes and stuff untangled will go a long
way. Thanks!    From You:  "Big items are peloton, your bike, inversion, grill, green egg. Let me know if anything else See below. I have gathered
clothes, ski gear, some electronics, art, decor, miscellaneous household items in front room so it should be an easy load up. Sounds good. Please don't
send junk stuff though. Let's just wait till mediation and when we need to make big decisions on our final places when we need to swedish clean and
put stuff in storage...
Original "Split List" TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).OK You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd
like to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in your sitting room.Furniture: I will move our sitting
room and guest room stuff to new place.I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may
prefer that from a measurement perspective. OK for guest room I am using beach stuff so we don;t need to buy anything. If you would prefer it I am
open to swapping and renting but it's your call. Patio: We agree it's not used, so I will take, but we can truly divide in mediation.OK They did not
have room for the crows nest stuff. I'd like to finish that part of the move.Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.You
can take all the grills. I will not use them. Does this include the green egg? If not, I can arrange for the dump. Sounds good. We can move those over.
Note there is a smoker that is under the hot tub mailbox as well.  Misc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?
Can take bean bag from man cave, Pelloton, Stair Master, desk all from Man Cave. I have nice Crate and Barrel art pieces that are not hanging up that
you can take a look at and decide. You can also take the Moose in living room, cows head on porch. From this list I would say we move any pieces that
you feel like sharing, the cow's head, I can take the bean bag if you want me to but I want a black cover so may need to order? Let's sell the Peleton. I
assume Max will need the stairmaster.  Kitchen: Realistic division of shared assets, I think you are working on that.Do you want the Crate and Barrel
yellow plateware set? I pulled out the SBUX set that I bought 10 plus years ago, and have started to use that. LMK if you want the whiteporcelain set
that was on wedding registry. Its barely used. and the plateware Christmas set from your mom. Just LMK. Let's wait for medition to start divying up
more of the plateware. I am fine for now.  Decorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.OK Love to still do this.
My place is bleak. I could really use your help as we discussed. Linens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?
Both households could use a refresh. Let's do this. I am happy to let you decide and just dupe. I am happy to order us the sheets that we used at the
beach that are so soft on the skin.  Other furniture for consideration
Master bedroom: I can use beach stuff as a temp option. We swap the mattresses.AgreeI think we are going to swap these at a later date. I don't want

I guess it's a good thing I put this here...
Per the discussion just now where you said I demanded to be in the house to get the TVs and hung up. I did not.
What I said was "Logistically you make the rules on how this happens, and I am happy to go along with them. If there is confusion, I am happy to
facetime to answer any questions"
That is not a demand to be in the house. It is the opposite of a demand to be in the house and even offers a logical alternative to being in the house via
a Facetime call.
I am happy to continue the discussion as you are threating to move my thins to storage while I am trying to work with you and saying that I am
making demands that I am not.
It's documented. Let's just please work together.

outlined. I have undeniable proof that will come out as you push your narrative and deny but your choice.
If you thought I was monitoring you in the Tesla, check log ins. Only times you will see is the evening you burst into the Kirkland house demanding I
use it to unlock the car and when you called me at work asking for the same as you locked yourself out at a local Sbux. I was unaware of the tracking
feature. Furthermore, you control all access and permission settings so I assume you could have deleted me at anytime. Please do so. I have deleted the

You continue to believe I can be treated differently than other humans. Can be abused, disrespected and my rights violated with consequences.
Nothing left to discuss on move other than scheduling the lugg.

Message 402 of 4024
When you sent this, I read it and left immediately. Adrian and I have been texting all weekend and you are correct in that I did not understand the
situation as well as I would like to. That goes for both tonight and since this all began. Admittedly I did not grasp the gravity of the situation initially
and should have treated it with the import and urgency it deserved. In my mind, I had my interpretation of what happened and did not give enough
credit to the merit of your interpretation. That was a mistake that I apologize for. I should have been more thoughtful of your perspective. I am sorry.
We had a pretty explosive discussion on this topic today. We talked about the back-and-forth between the lawyers and your dissatisfaction with the
current situation. You told me what your plan of action was and then said that I needed to make it right immediately if I wanted to avoid that
outcome. I want to be clear that I heard you and have taken action to that end immediately. But there is more to it than that. You feel like your trust
has been violated. You feel like that still might be the case. You are not confident in your safety and want to feel comfortable in your own space.
That, I agree, is an inalienable right. One that you should not have to ask for. You are entitled to that and I would like to do any and everything in my
power to assure you have that, not only for yourself but for the children we share. You are all still my family and I would give my dying breath in your
protection and I would like the opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Put you at ease. Give you 100% confidence that things you know have happened
have an explanation and are not dismissed as crazy musings. No crazymaking, just an honest discussion of the facts comparing our notes.
We are clearly in a tenuous legal situation. One that limits our opportunities to speak freely. But... since this all went down, and the gravity of the
situation has become clear, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the situation and possible outcomes, peaceful and otherwise.
And because we can't realistically do this in email, I'd like to propose a "take II" of our conversation earlier today. I'd like to hear your asks, and present
the thoughts I have to see if they might perhaps alleviate your concerns and lay the foundation for an honest path forward peacefully and respectfully.
If I may, please note I took time and sat on your email. I am trying to demonstrate the seriousness and respect for the situation I have. And I am scared
to death to even send this, but I have to try and answer your questions and give you what you need and deserve. If you need time also, please take it.
But please consider what I am proposing as well. It may make all the difference in our future.

I have one xl van Lugg booked for Friday AM
The plan is for me to look into getting a big truck as the week progresses and if I can, I will book that and cancel this.
The only other question is, if that is not possible, I can book another xl van for noon. Then we use two xl Vans instead of a truck. Still not great but
throwing it out there.
After yesterday, I am honestly not expecting a response on this or my other more important offer today.

Christine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of
your personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to assure you that my intention was never to monitor you or the boys in a way that would
compromise your privacy. I acknowledge your concerns, and in light of those, believe it would be best for us to separate any shared services, such as
ATT and Xfinity, where activity information is accessible to both of us. This will ensure you feel comfortable and secure, knowing that you are not
under any form of surveillance. Every account we have is shared today, so you are of course free to examine anything you’d like.
Regarding your concerns about cameras and electronic monitoring, the Blink cameras at the front door and garage door were installed when we both
lived in the home. They are plainly visible and serve as deterrents to potential intruders, similar to our security signs. These are the only cameras in
place. To explain what happened, I believe when the movers were there Tuesday with all the doors open, the wifi connection to the Blink cameras
refreshed.  The cameras have not worked in the past because they are too far from our wifi.  But with a clear line of sight and wifi signal, it allowed the
camera(s) to reconnect unexpectedly. But I can confirm I never watched a livestream. I opened an alert when it fired, reviewed move pictures of the
house taken Tuesday, and various other apps and photostories (at different times) when Adrian was visiting Wednesday. I did not know he had any
concerns at the time, but would have addressed them immediately if I had.
I am sorry my actions invaded your privacy. This won't happen again. There are no audio or video surveillance devices inside or outside the Kirkland

First, my mental health has taking a bit of a beating too after my soulmate and mother of my children blew up my entire life without so much as a
warning.
In fact, it was the opposite of a warning. It was confirmation we were better than ever. I expected to hold your hand and care for you (just like I did in
Alki) till the day I took my dying breath.
Our vow was through sickness and in health. And I agree we share a lack of understanding for each other after your decision. But you are not solo in
struggling with the outcome of July 4th and then July 5th.
Lastly, if you are just telling me that you are not going to be involved in this and expect me to mop up our entire love life here and send it in a Lugg,
that is news to me. So we should clear up if you are washing your hands clean of Alki commitments, like you did me.
And I don’t care to fight. But I have a right to my own feelings. You express yours every time we talk. Once a week via a text does not seem
inappropriate. And as I said, I don’t want to fight. I’m just trying to coordinate the situation that I was left to navigate.
If you turn on text we can do this much more effectively. I assure you I will stick to our rules.

So it’s frustrating dealing with you. You never respond to what I have said. Ever. I did not say you put him in the middle of this. Just like I did not say
I needed to enter the house to move when I suggested FaceTime instead. You respond to words you want me to have said so you can justify a fight. It’
s unproductive. We have to go back and forth and show you I never said it, putting the real issue on pause. Then you get pissed when you realize that,
and cut off communication so the issue is never addressed.
If there was inappropriate behavior of any sort I should be alerted. That’s the way things should work as parents of shared children. You say it was
appalling and he should have never seen it like this is some sort of porn situation. But again you won’t tell me what it is. What if whatever he thinks he
saw actually has a reasonable explanation? Is there any possibility that he might have not understood what he was seeing? Because I sure as hell did not
open any of your nudie pics, our Amazon shopping history of kinky bondage and sex toys, or your hidden KO folder of pics and gifts swapped. And
that is the only thing I can think of that meets this bar.
Wrt to Lawyers, I have been telling you that we should connect for a week. I think just presuming that there is no interest or I have been dumped as a
client is again, you making things up in your own mind. I have tried to communicate for a week now. But somehow you are 100% privy to everything
and I’m totally in the dark. Don’t you think there is an issue there? Is this really serving our best interests to say that we are not interested in trying to

If you recall Max is a liar. You are the one who confirmed it. You said you never told him that you were divorcing me while you were in Hong Kong.
You said it was a lie. And I sure as hell know, as do you I NEVER beat that kid at 2,3,4 or later in Mexico.
You just don’t get it. You have vilified the fuck out of me. They still don’t have a separation story. How fucked up is that? They just know Mom is

I’ll sell your half of the investment accounts on open in the AM. If you give me the routing number for your private account we can  severe at least the
2.5 this week. I don’t want to be responsible for it. You take over since you say you make all the money anyway.
But one night as you stare at the ceiling, in your brilliant mathematical brain you might wonder “we spend WAY beyond our means, far exceeding my
salary... how is it that we kept it afloat and our numbers still went up.”
Then you can try to buy your next house. And with that same brilliant math head on your shoulders will do the calc on a new home at 7.5% interest
rates. You probably will not remember how hard I road you to get us to sub 3% but you might. But if you really thought like I do, you would have
locked in our ARM when had the three chance.
Sorry for holding you back all these years in the way I mixed our portfolio, still tried to take care of the kids, and provid a vacation lifestyle. So since
you present yourself as single to the world to the shame of your family (while you are clearly still married) let’s be sure you can be single with your
investments too!

I tried to work with you and you started yelling and bitching at me from the get-go. You said I was abusing you as you laid into me and would not talk
about the move. I repeatedly offered to discuss the move. All you would do is insult me and still refuse to discuss the move.
It got to the point that I had to hang up because all you do is complain about self-determining situations that you create and I don't want to be a part
of that. I told you multiple times we could discuss the move only. That was not acceptable.
Instead, you want to put your head in the sand and make us do this bullshit exercise where you refuse to cooperate week after week, just like the
parenting plan you drug on for six months.

Do you check work email? We are addressing a very serious issue right now and it has some urgency. I would like to know how to communicate with
you in a way that doesn’t take 24 hours to respond. Please let me know if work email is better, I’m happy to do that, but would prefer not to.

Wait. I did not say I was threatening you. That is what you said. No big deal though.All I’m asking for is a way that we can communicate more
quickly and effectively on our son’s mental health. I’m not trying to fight at all. But when we chat you interrupt and then hang up. We need to do
better and I should have access to my son’s mental health concerns. That is all I am saying.
And I’m not fighting about Dr Brown. Let’s do it. But I think the way you are mandating a unilateral mental health decision is not right. I would like
some way to collaborate on his mental health. It’s like if we need to make other health decisions. Or to a much lesser extent something as simple as his
school choice or religious freedom. But these are the types of decisions we should make together.
That’s all I’m saying. And I don’t want to make a fuss. So please let me know how we work collaboratively like we did so well all day in a timely
manner, especially for the health and welfare of our children. I’m their Dad. Until I’m not, it’s a reasonable ask.
Can we work together please?

The Kirkland xfinity account was under both our names.
I have requested updating the Kirkland Xfinity account for change of ownership to just be me under my name, my email, my cell phone. This is in

The Alki and Bellevue xfinity accounts are under your name only so I do not have access to them.

Thanks for the parenting ultimatum. You did not need to send it again. You have been sharing your ultimatum all afternoon. I’m reasonably
intelligent enough to have recognized that the first time you made the unilateral decision despite the concerns I told you I had and tried to work with
you to reach a reasonable solution. I’d still like to please.
The irony of course is you won’t have the discussion based on your IT expertise that tells you my explanation is wrong. While you needed help to
change the WiFi password, reboot the network, flush the router, connect your laptop and phone (you did not follow basic written instructions on
password requirements ) and now you have locked us both out of our own accounts.
It feels a lot like you have explained a very simple transfer pricing principle to me, me but I keep telling you that you are wrong. Over and over and
then used it against you.
Recall I did this in our home, before your very eyes for 25 years. Going back to Napster with you in my lap to download to a laptop and stick a
cassette adapter into our tape deck to play our Favs. You are fairly wealth based on my domain knowledge as well.
Might you pause for a moment, consider I know what I am talking about, and love the kids (and actually you too) enough to try and help you? Why
on gods green earth would I try to harm a head on my kids head or violate the woman I still love. I told you I dreamed about us working out last night.
I long for a better relationship with you. I don’t want to screw you (well... lol)
If you can take a moment and think about the fact that I am still begging you to please give me the feedback that any spouse deserves so I could make
you happy I’d follow it in a second . I would do anything on earth to show you I  heard you, And we would be in a better place. We get frustrated
with the overall situation and fight dirty (like we always did with each other) but I’d do anything to have a good relationship with you.

Hey- sorry, did not see this. We went from coordinating the move and fixing Xfinity in real time all day like champs. But once you dropped off it was

We did discuss the remotes. In text and over the phone several times. I said the bed won’t work, and told you the TV one was white and had a green or
blue rubber cover.
If we did not discuss it why did you bring some of the things we did not discuss and put them on my car? We think alike, but that’s a stretch to think
you came up with that by yourself.
Either way. It was great working with you today. We got a ton done. And even with all the Xfinity mix ups I was able to get it fixed. Please do check to

I asked you to work with me about six hours ago. I worked with Xfinity as noted, to make you as the sole owner of 1210, and made sure I moved
Diamond status to your account. So did my best to set you up for success. And asked you to confirm you were happy with the new private set up.
It is approaching midnight. You stopped communicating and I still have no working bed to sleep on and no internet access. You have changed the
password and even though I’m listed as the owner now, I can’t get in because of the password change that you made. And they need to know why I
want to reverse something you did intentionally with them.
I told you that you took over my account all afternoon. We have so many mails on it back and forth. You said you were working with fraud and it
would be 24-48 hours. I kept asking just to call me so we could tag team like we had successfully all day. I know this stuff. But you still refused.
I made sure you were totally dialed in. Set up Lugg moves on the fly. You sent junk to my place after we agreed not to do that, sent me a bed that is flat
so I can’t sleep on it, a TV you know I need the remote for and are the only with access to my WiFi. Sheesh Christine. You are actively monitoring me
now (and we know we both know how it works) and sleeping on my bed with me on a couch.
Tbh this is really messed up. Like what do I need to do to get my admin access back from you? I showed you everything today. And got you up and
runnjng after you screwed it all up not following simple directions. So you know how it all works now if you paid attention. And now you can see
everything I do, just like you were complaining about with me.
The difference is you have done this willingly, knowingly, and in opposition to my asks. When we shared access that was voluntary on both parts,
whether you knew what you were doing or not.
But now you know!
I don’t want to fight. I’ll work with you to get my physical and digital property, IP, and WiFi access back. But like the kids, I’m asking to work
together. It’s not right for you just to steal it all from me, monitor me, and unilaterally control access to my digital life after making such a huge stink
over this the last ten days. You have to see that, right?
We don’t need to have the attorneys for this. It’s common sense. Can we please work together like when I was leading the charge today and everything

We used to have a deal, for better or worse-never wake up mad. I’m proposing we fall back tomorrow to our defense mechanism. I don’t care to fight

day that it made you nervous and scared and made me overconfident and hopeful.
Then the wheels came off. I am sorry for pushing blame on you and want to do better myself. I plan on doing some beach stuff tomorrow and also

If we need to connect before game you need to swap thoughts. I’ll be bringing you three Samsung universal remotes- living room, sitting room, our
bedroom. They will need batteries. In a pinch, AD usually has one or two hoarded away and then they have one in the man cave...
I will also bring you a decaf as usual. Let me know if you would like a 2/3 decaf instead. I’ve been enjoying that lately.
Adrian should be there 15 minutes early. So 12:45 if you don’t mind. It’s important for us both to set an example. Success is a habit

For the beach, I have a couple of the big suitcases. I have two hanging garmet bags.  Will also bring some boxes but I think I left some as well. Not sure
if we need some big trash bags but if you have, bring.
Note that I am waiting for a spot to charge so I can get back and forth today. I will be underground of course with no cell or WiFi. But promise to

- For richer, for poorer <<nope, as soon as my settlement payout cashed, so did you>>
- In sickness and in health <<nope, not for medically certified diseases, like SUDs>>
- Forsaking all others <<nope, I have pictures of "KO" from your that prove otherwise>>
- To love and to cherish <<nope, you lied repeatedly then dumped me with no warning>>
- Until death do us part <<nope, if you are reading this and I'm typing, we are still here>>
You can mentally wrestle with this all you like to fit your narrative. You can say that fucking me 3 times a day, regular date nights, shrooming every
weekend, healthy handmade lunches on the regular, musings of time alone, house hunting for the next chapter, dreaming of our future... was just
soothing. It was not. You were all in, above and beyond. And I fucking LOVED YOU for YOU!
The reality is you really do get it. You act like you don't, but your not so stupid not to realize the difference between "soothing", which would be just
keeping it on the rails vs. doing everything you could, going above and beyond, to show me we were working, we are on the right track. The changes
made were being rewarded. You made me happier than I have ever been in my life.
The narrative you are trying to rewrite makes you feel better. You self-soothe. Yes, I was an alcoholic, I did fight mean (as we both still do) But
marriage is about honesty and transparent communication. THAT IS THE COMMITMENT. You did none of that. You said "fuck it" I'm done.
You washed your hands clean without so much as a peep that what I was doing was not right.
You ruined our marriage with your dishonesty and deception. Period. You can justify it by saying I would not have changed. But you can NEVER
SAY YOU TRIED. What you did is not what our wedding vows mean. You broke every single one of them, Christine. You owed me the truth, not
lies and deception. You were my fucking rock. My proudest moment. My queen forever.

Is it even worth trying to get sorted? We have move, Alki, Dr Brown... and whatever else, all with hard deadlines and you going out of town next

Frankly I’m tired of trying with you. I was going to suggest starting the day off right like yesterday, but that honestly went nowhere and was a huge
waste.
I don’t want to fight, and I’m tired of this bullshit OFW where you log in every 8 hours and then complain my stuff is at the house while you no show
at Alki.
The hardest part I guess is even if we make rock solid plans you just fuck it up and then complain. Then threaten me to mail my shit or move to
storage.
Friday we had four bedroom pieces to move. They only moved one, and it was busted. They acted on your direction and moved a ton of junk instead.
Then you fuck up the whole Xfinity thing before acting like we did not have remote exchange plans. Meanwhile I ordered yours before you even
asked.
I wanted to write a nice email and suggest working together. It’s just not possible with you. You won’t communicate or stand by set plans.

So... we agree we are both escalating. If I read correctly, you started it, telling me I’m an abuser and began the 25 years of terror discussion, not me.
Your mo even when we in good times is that you say crazy stuff, are incredibly mean, and expect me not to reply.
I will find that to be challenging. Reflecting on the Golden Rule, you do unto others as you would have done to yourself. So don’t do it to me, and I’ll
be better about not doing what you just did to me back. Does that sound like a good plan? I can do it.
I’ll also struggle if you continue to lie about your lies.
It’s too much. You stood with me on a dirt path at Tumblecreek swearing to me, that what I am able to send to you never happened. It did. I have
pictures to prove it did. And you still deny it. Did HR see those?
Your dishonesty and deceit is undeniable. Yet you stand on a platform of an utterly false reality you created and preach, ruin my entire life, take my
queen, kids, home, money, and livelihood. All while you proactively destroy my reputation with friends.
Perhaps in your haste to ask me to reflect, as they say “physician, heal thyself”. Take a moment to examine your deeds. We should be strolling the

You don’t problem solve. You intentionally obstruct progress to elicit a response that suits your legal

Message 631 of 4024
We have a difference of opinion.
Your emails started with you couldn’t figure where I put it in the mess of boxes and bags. Putting blame on me for not having AAA card. That
appeared to be a first poke.
I responded that I gave it to.
That seemed to provide you with enough that I poked you first versus responding to your attack, to decide it appropriate to launch into what you
wrote, which was not related to location of card at all.
Your perspective.
Unless you need any additional help with AAA I’ll consider the issue for AAA help closed.

I just said that all of my stuff was dumped from organized drawers (not in the drawer, but by drawer). You may say you have a different perspective
on if you did that. But you did. And I can show you that you did. Just like any number of things you have done to me, denied you did, but I can show
you with proof. So if I can prove it with 100% certainty, like I have shown you before, I don’t see that as a poke. And I see your denial as just you

Check it out! You can send one that says to the other person that you are just thinking of them so they think of you. Or even that you love them.
I just thought they were glasses or candle holders. They are actually not. They are deep and meaningful gifts to illicit mutual feelings. Awesome!
BTW- the sexy Cum Together rocker with the message of enhancing someone’s flavor, over time, is sold out. Tell KO to hold on to that one!
Hmmm... I was saying that because he can sell on eBay for more. But he won’t sell those. They were a gift from his dirty married secret.
It’s funny because you saw how much your gift of Cabo glasses meant to me. No inscription, 20% of the price. He’s lucky by comparison to me.
But it is what it is. I was just your soulmate of 30 years. Father of all three of your children, even taking one on that you made without me.

So.... To confirm, as I called you out (like I am off to do when you don’t tell the truth on critical matters of our family’s destruction) you can NOT
stand by your assertion below? You always have a reason, or explanation when we know you are being dishonest.
With Yurushka it was, “we are not doing that” till I showed you a digital footprint that what I was saying was true and you were being dishonest.
Then your story evolved’ let’s say to accommodate the truth; and you said your dishonesty was actually justified.
I can go on.. KO,  Xmas, vacations, telling our close friends I’m an abuser. Honestly (if you know what that means) if we just start being truthful it
will save us about 80% of the time we waste talking to each other.
Let’s just do that!
- Start being honest with me
- Don’t say things you can’t prove
- Stick to the truth and move forward
Then there is zero need to hang up like you do every time I call BS on your fake reality. No need to record or have someone eavesdrop either. Let’s do

I have shared this is the situation you unilaterally created by refusing me the slightest insight into the situation. So I can not address. And because I
stand by what I say, I will attach it again here for reference.
Note that I am still all in on a mutually agreeable path forward with Dr Brown even though you have rejected every piece of her advice or
recommendations to date. Let’s just be on the same page because you have proven over and over to manipulate both therapist, our narrative, and in
the end, the output.
Specifically, for tomorrow I’ll ask Elsa over as well to help me around here. It’s not because I need the supervision of the young woman I raised and
walked down the aisle. It’s because I do not want a fight.
Most important is that I show Adrian he is not banned from his life here so he stops the incredibly destructive “self-blame” he is left to wallow in
today.
I hope a chaperoned visit sounds like a reasonable compromise and assures your concerns are met.

Let’s go to court and get this sorted once and for all. I am making arrangements to talk to my lawyer.
Cancelling plans to talk at 12:30 today. It does not feel safe nor will it be documented.
Communications will be strictly on OFW.
I will not respond in evenings and during times expected parties to be asleep. Immediately response is not also required or expected.

Communications that have anger and areas where it feels threatening or unsafe I am flagging. The restraining order will cover and will be shared with
your lawyer shortly.
If emergencies, at this time, I have the kids so nothing should be needed.

Whoa!!! Stop. Let’s talk as planned please.
I don’t want to fight. I just asked if you could show me that you have full custody. I am not going to fight you. I am happy with our parenting plan

I finally got in
Christ... I’m reading what you wrote. Christine. Please don’t blow up. What on earth did I do? I agreed with everything you asked below. We also
agreed (and chatted once already) that Dr Brown for AD is important enough to address today. It’s the way we started this thread.
And the only question I had, I specifically said I would “pause” not fight. Not escalate. Pause. What else can I do to not be confrontational with you
other than to ask to stop that discussion if it made you mad or we just disagreed. That’s what pause means. Literally.
Why are you escalating, making threats, and refusing what you have already agreed is an urgent enough issue to talk immediately. I said I would pause
Christine. I did not escalate or do anything that should cause you to feel unsafe.
Please re-read what I said. I don’t want to fight. Why are you escalating when I asked to stop the discussion and work on the most immediate plan? I
really don’t get how asking you to stop a discussion we have a different pov on is worth an escalation.
Why are you doing this?

You agreed to the restraining order knowing the impacts.
Given the escalation of tone in emails, texts, calls, it was prudent to put in place additional guardrails around communications .
This morning’s email was just another example of an unwanted and disturbing communication that was intended to cause distress and disrupt. It had
nothing to do with kids or other areas we are navigating.

I thought you did not use your Amex. You have said that on many occasions. Like over and over. How did you spend almost 15k on a card you
assured me that you don’t use. I can find the many emails you said that in if your memory is failing as it has since July 4th.

The items I listed are ready to move. I have not touched anything since that last lugg move. You were aware of items that were moved. In light of
concerns of recording devices and monitoring equipment hidden in residence, I would like to move these items out of the house as I am uncertain if
in your belongings.
There is still hidden a router that is broadcasting a WiFi signal and the hidden Blink modules that I haven’t located.
Parenting. The children have expressed concern in regards to safety. I suggested Dr. Brown to assist navigating. You are refusing on this platform

There are still some items that hit that account but I have moved majority to BofA. Some items likely hit the Amex when BofA did not have enough
cash and we needed credit to cover.
Can you move your charges that currently hit the Chase card to your Amex or fidelity to track spend.
I have tried use BofA debit for household and kids expenses.
We will both need to provide details of all cc spend for all cards when we do financial disclosures.

There continues to be spend on card, especially since we are unable to keep sufficient cash in BofA account to cover basics such as mortgage tuition
and rent. We have overdrawn. You control the msft account (which is community property) but the other investment account I am able to access
Moving forward I too will initiate stock sales if cash runs low.
The sales of msft stock from that account is from community funds. You have blocked me from accessing and I currently have no visibility.

You are welcome to do as you like. I would not recommend it as I have employed a strategy that has netted us ~55% over the last year. But you do you.
I have told you on numerous occasions to just let me know when we need cash. I like to generate income as long as possible. I have never delayed a
transfer.
I’m not trying to argue but I don’t get how there could be more spend since you stopped in October. And especially ~15k. I trust you, but it makes no
sense.
Happy to move to Amex too like you. I was just doing so much on Amazon that it seemed like a sound decision. Do you feel like that is not the case!
I understand what we will need to provide. Why are you telling me that? We also are supposed to have a parenting plan in place. That has never
mattered.
If you want to have an all up “Running List” discussion I would like to at your convenience. I assume you have to initiate, I will be kind, and it would
help.
This OFW thing is fine. I am happy to abide by it so you feel safe. That is super important. But I hope you can still use the phone so we can really
progress.
With all that’s going on, especially w.r.t. to the kids mental health it would be much easier to sort ahead of time rather than in front of them. I promise
to be kind and constructive.
And if I am not, end the call. No second chances. But for you and the kids I assure you I will be on my Monday night behavior. When I honestly
thought we started a new chapter of cooperation till we did the opposite. Please consider.

I’d like for us to discuss Dr Brown and how to engage. I’d actually like for you and I to meet first and asked her how she would suggest we address.
Like we are doing with Ms Betts.
No offense, I am happy for Anna Lisa to author the text, but I want her no where near planning for ADs mental health. Fair?

Can we try 9:30? I can make it work.
We can also be nice and knock out some of our other stuff if you like! I’m all in on working with you when we are not competing with the days stress
and noise. For that matter, maybe unless it’s urgent, we could set a time to knock stuff out. Maybe 20 minutes every other day or something?
I want to figure out how to make this work! It’s no Monday at the beach, but we can make it work within our new boundaries

Yeah, we need to discuss this a bit. You were not aware of the services you had. This had zero to do with me. We need to be clear wrt to
1) the cam issue and the explanation
2) what happens on Xfinity as a service
If we are going to put this to bed, let’s do it as a team working for the mental health of our children. We should both be all in. Me, on my apology, you
on your acceptance. And tell the same story.
Let’s not mess with them. And if you really don’t understand what I have explained please ask. If you think im still lying anyway, let’s please don’t
agree, sign the RO and still undercut the story.
Does that sound reasonable?
I’ll watch for alerts. Thank you for doing that. It’s freaking nuts, right???
Next up Bank of America  I’ll explain what they told me and let’s see how to fix.

I’m sticking with OFW for co parenting issues only and not going to do calls, texts and emails per the RO.
For Dr. Brown I can send an email but am not comfortable meeting with her together first.
My lawyer and I are discussing your proposal on how to use Dr. Brown tomorrow and will come back with response on that and your replies to my
requests for information.
First Xfinity, BofA, Alki and CC, I don’t have your answers but that will now need to go through lawyers. If you want to send your responses to my
asks here you are welcome but I won’t engage in those discussions anymore.
Premera can walk you through how to submit the Luis bills and re submit Yurishka bill for reimbursement. As Yurishka is from last year you will have
a limited time to do so. I am also uncertain if you sent the doc from my work to get the cobra portion of me and kids insurance reimbursed that was
erroneously charged.I have not seen any more charges so you may also want to check you are still paying the cobra premium for your insurance
through msft.

Super bummed we came to this after Monday. The giggles and jokes in the elevator seem like yesterday. I honestly thought we had battled back. To a
place of kindness and cooperation. Where we understood the finality of our situation as we emptied out the place where we shared so much. But we
were going to be kind, share grace. And work together to do the right thing, and make smart decisions. That is why I texted you my high hopes for a
new start.
Is there any possible way, any way at all that we can take one day and just let this rest? Stop the fighting, lay down our arms, and maybe not find
kindness, but at least find civility. There are so many hurt feelings for opportunities lost. But may we please pause for just a moment and take some
time before we make permanent decisions. If you will please, I would love to stand down and resume on Sunday

As mentioned, having Elsa over yesterday was a great help. We made progress unpacking and organizing things. Small progress.
That said, the most important thing was when she was watching me tear the place apart holding my SoberLink case and said “oh, if you need that, I
packed it at the beach. It’s in the black Thule case”
This is the gift from you of course. The problem is, I have not located that Thule case in the tens of boxes and bags I have in the place. It’s really
harder than you might imagine.
I’ll stop everything this AM and just focus on finding that. She was just trying to help, and it is not her fault, it’s mine. I bring it everywhere, and felt
like it was important to have when we saw each other.

But I did not consider that it would be grabbed and stuck in a random box as part of our move. Still, all my fault even if it was just a series of honest,
well meaning, mistakes.
Please let me know if you would like a UA and I’ll be more than happy to accommodate. I will also let you know if I find it or not by end of day so I
can offer next steps for your consideration.
I consider this to be child related, so hope you agree even if it is part of a parenting plan we don’t have. So hope OFW is suitable for this.
Regardless of having nothing mandating this, it is still important to me to demonstrate my commitment to sobriety and assure you that I am always
sober even when I can’t see my kids.
Obviously if we need to address in front of a judge at some point soon, I’m sure Elsa will testify to this, but it is ultimately still my responsibility.

I assumed you knew it said that. I’m not trying to argue. I’ll copy and paste it here. I thought it was on purpose?
Is Max sick again? Is something going on. From afar it seems like it is an issue that I’m a little concerned about.
I am happy to reach out too. But we have not had a moment to discuss final messaging and who does what. I’d love to move ahead ASAP.
I asked Lisa if I am allowed to CC you on mails where we need to work on things together yesterday,nbut, as Anna Lisa knows well, she sent all of this
the day before Lisa was scheduled to be out for two weeks.
I am bummed because it is reminiscent of the close of business meeting before a holiday before going dark the week after. It just makes things hard on
you and it seems and we fight. That is unfair to us imho.
I guess in the business world, I would not wait till the night before Chinese New Year to send a critical, large, time consuming request to my
colleagues in Beijing. Anna Lisa should confirm what I said. I made sure she knew of Lisa’s plans two weeks ago.
But I’m not trying to pick a fight. Please don’t take it that way.
I am not sure what the enrollment for Max entails but assume it is just affirmation that he will continue at SAAS.
fwiw- i think I have several relevant docs your should see for tax and estate planning but I think that is a forbidden conversation?

Per your request, please see attached. I
Obviously, it does not say "I beat you," it says I am a "credible threat to the physical safety of you, Max and Adrian" with a history of showing I will do
that and will again. I am not trying to fight this assertion. That would make this situation even worse and be further evidence to be used against me. I

would never harm you all. Ever...
Per the attached, you and Anna Lisa are saying:
- There is a Serious Concern for Safety: The court believes that there is a legitimate and convincing reason to be concerned for the safety of the
protected person. This is not a speculative or unfounded fear; it's based on credible evidence of similar incidents.
- Physical Safety at Risk: The focus of this statement is on the physical safety of the protected persons. It demonstrates that the court has a real and
demonstrated reason to believe the restrained person will cause physical harm to the persons ordered to be protected.
- Justification for Restraining Order: This finding is the key factor in the court's decision to issue the restraining order. It justifies the need for legal
protection because there is a clear and demonstrated pattern and history of physical abuse from the target of the order.
- Increased Vigilance and Enforcement: With such a clause in place, law enforcement and the court are likely to be more vigilant in enforcing the
order. Violations will be treated with greater seriousness given the perceived risk to physical health and safety of the protected.
- Potential Impact on Other Provisions: This clause will influence other aspects of the restraining order, such as restrictions on proximity,
communication restrictions, and other specific behaviors. The proven threat of bodily harm makes the request highly credible.
- It's important the restrained person and the protected person understand the very serious implications of this clause. The restrained person must be
aware of the seriousness of the situation and the need to strictly adhere to the terms of the order to avoid legal consequences.
- The protected person should understand they are asking for this level of risk mitigation and can demonstrate a history of this behavior so the court
can take all necessary precautions for the physical safety of those being protected given its likelihood of happening again.
Message 813 of 4024
Just to reiterate, I am not trying to physically threaten you or the kids in any way as noted in the RO or with this communication. If you feel quoting
the RO you sent, along with the associated research, is a threat, please let me know immediately.
If so, I promise to address your concerns immediately with my attorney and the court to reassure you, the kids, and the court that I am not
threatening physical or sexual violence now, or ever. Even if you think it is likely to happen in the future.
You just asked me to "Show me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers." So, I'm trying to accommodate my
interpretation of your ask, understanding you did this with your lawyer with a clear intent and purpose.
I will never physically or sexually abuse you or my children. If asked to sign something implying, I have and am likely to do it again, to keep you from
pursuing much more serious courses of action against me, I am just registering my concerns.

I have a lot of questions and concerns about some of the content below and the moves I am making that you may not be aware of. I also have some
things that you should have that impact things like our taxes. I would not want to violate the RO however.
I just don't know how this will work without at least a little planning and logistics coordination. I feel we will stumble over each other and may end
up using something that the other has plans for. Or one of us may be unaware the other has a pipeline move waiting to execute.
Anyway, as mentioned, you guys know Lisa is gone for the next two weeks and has several additional dates on the calendar for out-of-state trials and
other engagements. I'm looking at our numbers and am afraid we are going to crash and burn without coordination.
Even if we had some sort of approved "running list" meeting with strict ground rules it would go a long way. I am trying to assure you that I will be on
my Monday behavior (and would have continued if I was not blackballed Monday PM) But this is the last time I'll say this.
Fingers crossed because I'm making moves, and I am sure you are too. I feel we are flying without a net and unless my subject line is always "Our Kids
Inheritance" as a way to address, we are taking an enormous risk to our fiscal viability before mediation.
I'm in your hands. Have a great day. I'm out!
