  "text": "But one night as you stare at the ceiling, in your brilliant mathematical brain you might wonder “we spend WAY beyond our means, far exceeding my\nsalary... how is it that we kept it afloat and our numbers still went up.”\nThen you can try to buy your next house. And with that same brilliant math head on your shoulders will do the calc on a new home at 7.5% interest\nrates. You probably will not remember how hard I road you to get us to sub 3% but you might. But if you really thought like I do, you would have\nlocked in our ARM when had the three chance.\nSorry for holding you back all these years in the way I mixed our portfolio, still tried to take care of the kids, and provid a vacation lifestyle. So since\nyou present yourself as single to the world to the shame of your family (while you are clearly still married) let’s be sure you can be single with your\ninvestments too!\nSent:01/17/2024 at 05:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 05:28 PM)\nSubject:Sell on Open\nMessage 503 of 4024\nI hope you were able to make the changes you wanted to make today to assure you feel safe.
