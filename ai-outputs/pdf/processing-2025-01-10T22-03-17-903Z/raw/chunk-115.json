You saw what I requested.\nTbh I’m not going to spend my energy fighting with you in this. I didn’t deserve what happened and you need to deal with the consequences. I’m\ndone being traumatized by you\nSent:01/15/2024 at 12:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\nMessage 410 of 4024\nChrist, Christine. I am not trying to make excuses! I want to solve the issue with you! Please give me that chance. You are asking for answers and not\nallowing me to provide them. Please let me do that.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 12:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 12:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\nMessage 411 of 4024\nIt needs to go through the lawyers so it’s documented. I’m not messing around and will not allow you to treat me as if you can do what you like\nanymore.\nJust think of it as if you did it to a stranger. What would they do? Call the police and have you face the full consequences you stated in many occasion\nI should have done that. That’s how I will act from now on. You don’t get a pass anymore. That’s what enabled you before.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 12:56 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 12:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\nMessage 412 of 4024\nOk. Can we at least have the conversation so I am clear? It can be brief. I just want to hear from you.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 01:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\nMessage 413 of 4024\nI will spell it out.\nFull disclosure of all cameras, surveillance devices, monitoring activities in residence, car, email, phones, internet activity etc for myself and children,\npast and present that I am unaware of and did not give consent.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 01:08 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 01:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg",
