I’m struggling with the idea of this being the same thing we just did.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 02:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 333 of 4024\nRemind me next steps on this?\nSent:01/09/2024 at 03:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:20 PM)\nSubject:Microwave\nMessage 334 of 4024\nYeah, we stalled out once we digressed. I can pull a master plan together. Here is off the top of my head.\n- Install the Microwave\n- TV situation, short, medium term\n- Swap the Beds and dresser\n- Finish Kirkland move\n- Bikes resting place\n- Kitchen table move\nSo the TV I am bringing you tonight is super nice. It was going to go in my main TV room. But we can put it in yours just as well. Then we decide if\nwe just remount what I juts took down as art, or if I take that one and you get a cheaper one since it won’t be used much anyway. But not sure I want\nthat for my big TV experience. Anyway, let’s get you sorted tonight. I’ll order the replacement part. And we can decide later.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 03:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Microwave\nMessage 335 of 4024\nWhen we get a moment to catch our breath we really need to get that started. We have so many that need to start running concurrently. This all feels\nso overwhelming. And we still have not reached back out to Dr Brown for Phase II guidance. I guess we can sync on all of this during “running list”.\nDo you still have that or need me to resend again?\nSent:01/09/2024 at 04:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:Therapy",
