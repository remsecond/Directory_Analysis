Would be great to confirm you see\nthis. I really don’t want to be near our home without you involved. Thanks.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 04:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/05/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 241 of 4024\nOk. I thought you stopped by earlier but 5:30 works.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 04:52 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/05/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 242 of 4024\nWe did, for the switch.\nWe forgot he also had practice.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 04:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/06/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today\nMessage 243 of 4024\nIt was probably one of the best ever, tbh. Really an awesome day. AD is just amazing. And I really love coaching his team. I’m in my element. For that\nmatter, I’ve turned a corner I think. I look great, feel great, and we have a parenting plan so all my big problems are solved.\nThat said, I did miss your voice on this special day for the first time in 29 years. Even when we talked late at night from River Oaks Parkway to\nSeymour Road. There will be a lot of firsts in our ending. That’s fine. But tbh, I still love some part of you. I don’t feel bad about it either.\nAnd you say I don’t have that kind of access to you, so that is fine. But when I pledged to love you till death do us part, I meant it. And I still do. And\neven though you hate everything about me, I know in my heart I never held malice for you. I learned wrong. Not an excuse, a reality.\nI’m not asking you for anything. And I’m entitled to my own feelings and my own reality. It’s me that we\nare talking about after all. And I know more about the how, why, and intent of my actions than anyone, even you. So I’m ok telling you I know my\ntruth. And we can both be right.\nHope when things get better I can have a rain check on my bday dinner. It would be nice to break bread with an old friend who I shared so many of\nthese days with in the past. Till then, I’ll do my best with this new opportunity and move the hell on with my life. Unexplained as it is.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 11:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/06/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:My Birthday",
