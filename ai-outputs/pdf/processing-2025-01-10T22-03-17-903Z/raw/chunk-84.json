Don’t want a fight however.\nThanks\nSent:01/08/2024 at 12:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Urgent and Emergency Contact\nMessage 304 of 4024\nI did inform you the other day as texts and calls were used for non emergency situations and inappropriate content that made me feel threatened,\nunsafe, triggered and incredibly anxious. They crossed the line.\nI can ask my lawyer on options, as can you and open to feedback but I cannot subject myself to these types of communications.\nOne option is that our text messages always include a third party and never direct to each other.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent and Emergency Contact\nMessage 305 of 4024\nHere are the only things I have texted you. Both were quick twitch enough to send by text. I wondered why you lit into me at Basketball and did not\nseem to know about my offer for child logistics, but it makes sense now. I hope we can get back to the phase I parenting plan soon. And I\nacknowledge that means I need to be judicial in my use as well. I have not shown you the consistency nor the discipline you deserve. Please let me\nknow what your plans are so I’m not surprised again.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent and Emergency Contact\nAttachments:IMG_0843.PNG (1 MB)",
