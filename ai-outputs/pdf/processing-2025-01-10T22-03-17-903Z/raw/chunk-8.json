I thought I was Xmas AM gifts. You had last night. If you are going to do it anyway, which confuses me (that’s why I brought it up yesterday- I\nknew it started early) let me know if you need more time. Hard to understand what we agreed to.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 07:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 07:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas\nMessage 36 of 4024\nAre you doing the riddles too? Just want to understand what part of our tradition you are doing  Xmas AM as I thought I was doing it with the kids.\nLooks like I’m just the encore for today so just want to plan.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 07:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 07:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas\nMessage 37 of 4024\nNo riddles.

I’ve been pretty transparent, and we agreed how we would do this, in great detail for months.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 07:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 07:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xmas",
