I did not.\nWhat I said was \"Logistically you make the rules on how this happens, and I am happy to go along with them. If there is confusion, I am happy to\nfacetime to answer any questions\"\nThat is not a demand to be in the house. It is the opposite of a demand to be in the house and even offers a logical alternative to being in the house via\na Facetime call.\nI am happy to continue the discussion as you are threating to move my thins to storage while I am trying to work with you and saying that I am\nmaking demands that I am not.\nIt's documented. Let's just please work together.\nSent:01/14/2024 at 10:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 11:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\nMessage 390 of 4024\nI need to book the Lugg.

After you told me to shut up over the phone.\nIt is incredible how you are treating me given the circumstances. The tone and attitude. It defies logic given the incredible harm you have done to\nSent:01/14/2024 at 11:34 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/14/2024 at 11:38 AM)\nSubject:Language and tone",
