  "text": "Any items that are mine and/or kids can be sent when we do the bedroom swap.\nMessage 468 of 4024\nFirst, my mental health has taking a bit of a beating too after my soulmate and mother of my children blew up my entire life without so much as a\nwarning.\nIn fact, it was the opposite of a warning. It was confirmation we were better than ever. I expected to hold your hand and care for you (just like I did in\nAlki) till the day I took my dying breath.\nOur vow was through sickness and in health. And I agree we share a lack of understanding for each other after your decision. But you are not solo in\nstruggling with the outcome of July 4th and then July 5th.\nLastly, if you are just telling me that you are not going to be involved in this and expect me to mop up our entire love life here and send it in a Lugg,\nthat is news to me. So we should clear up if you are washing your hands clean of Alki commitments, like you did me.\nAnd I don’t care to fight. But I have a right to my own feelings. You express yours every time we talk. Once a week via a text does not seem\ninappropriate. And as I said, I don’t want to fight. I’m just trying to coordinate the situation that I was left to navigate.\nIf you turn on text we can do this much more effectively. I assure you I will stick to our rules.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 10:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 469 of 4024\nI can head over Saturday to pack up items.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 10:55 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 10:59 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 470 of 4024\nOk. I’ll do my best to get things I know are not an issue out prior to that. What time would you like to meet for the decision making and a little light\nmoving that I just can’t do solo?\nSent:01/17/2024 at 11:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 11:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 471 of 4024\nDo we need to meet? I don’t feel comfortable.\nFor larger items can we do a lugg?\nSent:01/17/2024 at 11:04 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 11:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment",
