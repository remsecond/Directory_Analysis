I need to wait for a call which could take 24-48 hours to verify. Once this is done, you will need to call and reset your password for Bellevue and\nAlki location\nSent:01/19/2024 at 05:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 566 of 4024\nThanks for the parenting ultimatum. You did not need to send it again. You have been sharing your ultimatum all afternoon. I’m reasonably\nintelligent enough to have recognized that the first time you made the unilateral decision despite the concerns I told you I had and tried to work with\nyou to reach a reasonable solution. I’d still like to please.\nThe irony of course is you won’t have the discussion based on your IT expertise that tells you my explanation is wrong. While you needed help to\nchange the WiFi password, reboot the network, flush the router, connect your laptop and phone (you did not follow basic written instructions on\npassword requirements ) and now you have locked us both out of our own accounts.\nIt feels a lot like you have explained a very simple transfer pricing principle to me, me but I keep telling you that you are wrong. Over and over and\nthen used it against you.\nRecall I did this in our home, before your very eyes for 25 years. Going back to Napster with you in my lap to download to a laptop and stick a\ncassette adapter into our tape deck to play our Favs. You are fairly wealth based on my domain knowledge as well.\nMight you pause for a moment, consider I know what I am talking about, and love the kids (and actually you too) enough to try and help you? Why\non gods green earth would I try to harm a head on my kids head or violate the woman I still love. I told you I dreamed about us working out last night.\nI long for a better relationship with you. I don’t want to screw you (well... lol)\nIf you can take a moment and think about the fact that I am still begging you to please give me the feedback that any spouse deserves so I could make\nyou happy I’d follow it in a second . I would do anything on earth to show you I  heard you, And we would be in a better place. We get frustrated\nwith the overall situation and fight dirty (like we always did with each other) but I’d do anything to have a good relationship with you.\nPlease give me the benefit of doubt after 30\nyears of being madly in love with you.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 05:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 567 of 4024\nBecause you can’t do it that way! I tried to tell you so many times. We move fast and screw things up.\nPlease. Please. Please. Start listening to me. Please?\nWe are going to screw our entire retirement and legacy if you can’t just slow down. Im not a nut job.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 05:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account",
