I told you before, you complained you were\nnot involved, but I asked you to be involved. I am doing that again. Would you like to be involved?\nMessage 260 of 4024\nYou are sending me blackmailing texts.\nYou signed a lease yesterday for 6.800 without consultation and communicated it’s all community property and within your rights to commit me to a\nspend for my half without my input.\nThreatening me that you will make unilateral decisions because I will not respond to your blackmail threatening texts is your choice.\nI do not plan to respond to any more emails, texts, calls or this platform as I feel threatened.\nSent:01/06/2024 at 06:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/06/2024 at 06:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Decisions\nMessage 261 of 4024\nAs I have mentioned many times before. On several platforms now, I’d like your feedback on a 9 or 12 month lease. I am asking you directly again,\njust like I have been for days. I’m not trying to fight you.\nAnd I am not escalating. I am also not addressing what you are saying below. I don’t believe that to be true but you’re free to say what you want.\nDo you want to be involved in the term of the lease decision or not?\nSent:01/06/2024 at 07:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/06/2024 at 07:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: Decisions\nMessage 262 of 4024\nOk... fyi I was able to talk him into 9 months with month to month after. I’d like 12, I’m so tired\nof moving. But want to be sensitive to the churn at play. I’m assuming that is what you would like.\nI’m really trying, Christine, I’m just done waiting. On a place to live, getting my stuff, getting a parenting plan for our kids. everything that allows me\nto move on. Everywhere you’re blocking me from doing it.\nAnd while I sympathize that you ALWAYS say you have no time, but make time for new relationships while your kids don’t even know about the\ndivorce and I’m totally blocked, my sympathy runs thin.\nYou have made zero effort for the kids therapy, or the the work we are supposed to be doing. It’s awesome you’re putting yourself first, but please\nstart making some time to clean up the wreckage you are creating.\nForget about me. You hate me.\nThink about the freaking kids.\nSent:01/06/2024 at 08:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 08:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Decisions",
