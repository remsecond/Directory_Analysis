DV was never in our vocabulary at 47 and 56 unless I was cooking\nsausages for the ladies breakfast.\nThen Yurushka introduced the label it and it has driven almost everything in our life for the last six months. Why would he be asking about that? It’s\nadult business he shouldn’t be exposed to.\nAgree?\nSent:01/03/2024 at 08:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 07:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV\nMessage 222 of 4024\nBoth kids were witness to it Robert during their entire lives.\nTo be exact about when I know for certain Adrian heard the term is below on Wednesday September 13. I have contemporaneous notes from that\nday. You left for Oregon for our safety. Below is a recap.\nI tried to leave the home in the car as you were acting unsafe and irrational and snatched my phone away from me. More details can be provided if\nneeded. As you were blocking me from leaving the house from the car, Adrian came and started using his safe word with me. What followed is I\nescaped from you and left  through the front door. You chased me out of the house and started yelling “you are a domestic violence abuser” loudly.\nThat is when Lisa drove by in her car and removed me from the situation. I texted the kids to meet me at her place.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 07:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV\nMessage 223 of 4024\nI said that he said “DV” . He did not translate what you believe happened to the two letter acronym. Which even in your story does not note. How\ndid he learn the term DV if he has never heard it?\nThe larger point is, and I’m tired of fighting with you as you justify your destruction and smear campaign (including with the parents of our kids\nfriends l) on me. You are doing it and are dishonest about it.\nIt’s simply not in the kids interest to portray me as a monster to them or to our long long time friends. We have a plan. Let’s stop the character\nassassination and recognize it’s better for our kids mental health.\nI’m not going to argue with you here today. I want to start doing right by the kids. I always build you up to them. I want them to look up to, respect,\nand be proud of you. It’s best for them if you do the same.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV",
