  "text": "I have shared this is the situation you unilaterally created by refusing me the slightest insight into the situation. So I can not address. And because I\nstand by what I say, I will attach it again here for reference.\nNote that I am still all in on a mutually agreeable path forward with Dr Brown even though you have rejected every piece of her advice or\nrecommendations to date. Let’s just be on the same page because you have proven over and over to manipulate both therapist, our narrative, and in\nthe end, the output.\nSpecifically, for tomorrow I’ll ask Elsa over as well to help me around here. It’s not because I need the supervision of the young woman I raised and\nwalked down the aisle. It’s because I do not want a fight.\nMost important is that I show Adrian he is not banned from his life here so he stops the incredibly destructive “self-blame” he is left to wallow in\ntoday.\nI hope a chaperoned visit sounds like a reasonable compromise and assures your concerns are met.\nMessage 676 of 4024\nI do not agree. We do not have 50/50.\nPlease go to your lawyer and we can work through them and the courts.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 10:28 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 10:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 677 of 4024\nLet’s break this up into a couple pieces please:\n- Wednesday- can we have the chaperoned visit as discussed below? Even a court would award that.\n- 50/50 Custody- I’ll pause because that is news to me. If I don’t have legal custody please share\nThanks!\nSent:01/23/2024 at 10:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 10:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 678 of 4024\nLet’s go to court and get this sorted once and for all. I am making arrangements to talk to my lawyer.\nCancelling plans to talk at 12:30 today. It does not feel safe nor will it be documented.\nCommunications will be strictly on OFW.\nI will not respond in evenings and during times expected parties to be asleep. Immediately response is not also required or expected.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 10:48 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 11:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today",
