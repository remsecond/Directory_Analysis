So if Max is in the window where his can be\nre-upped you might call it in. If you share the kids insurance cards I might also be able to help pick up.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 09:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 09:30 AM)\nSubject:Vyvanse\nMessage 298 of 4024\nNo issue\nSent:01/08/2024 at 09:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 09:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: My Gas Station\nMessage 299 of 4024\nI’ll need to check with Max but think he is ok.\nWalgreens has his updated card on file but I will upload on this platform this week\nSent:01/08/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 09:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Vyvanse\nMessage 300 of 4024\nLet me know when is a good time. I’ll make decisions anyway but I’ll want to talk about what we need to do here. The NTV mail. Mediation update.\nAnd tbh, this is hard as fuck. I’m not asking to be soothed, but I am doing the heavy lifting in a place you showered praise on me for creating.\nSo I’m hoping that we can show goodwill and compassion as we work through this...\nSent:01/08/2024 at 12:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/08/2024 at 12:15 PM)\nSubject:Touch Base\nMessage 301 of 4024\nDo you have time at 12:30?
