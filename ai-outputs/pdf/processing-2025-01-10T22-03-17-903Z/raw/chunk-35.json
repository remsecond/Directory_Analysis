  "text": "Message 136 of 4024\nOk. Tonight you said you are not going to work on the parenting plan anymore. We are a one hour conversation away (because we only covered your\nstuff) from getting this months long goat rodeo of misdirection finished.\nI realize we both think the other is the reason we can’t get it done so I won’t argue that. It’s wasted breath and finger pointing. But please let me know\nif you are refusing to work on it as we both think we have been trying since September.\nYou seem hell bent on making this whole affair acrimonious at all costs at every turn. Making zero effort to even get the help Dr Brown said in person\nand in email that we should get ASAP. Maybe you know better than the pro.\nI don’t get that, but I’ll accept it.\nSent:12/29/2023 at 10:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/30/2023 at 08:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Parenting Plan Review\nMessage 137 of 4024\nI sent you all our agreed to revisions in an updated and cleaned up doc via email. I also documented your new proposals that were never discussed\nwith Dr Brown. I trust they are accurate or you will clarify.\nPlease see the same content of the email for additional clarity as well for your record keeping here on OFW below. Hoping you will work on this. I am\nplanning to move forward and want it baked in 2023.\nI really do want to work with you to start the new year.\nSincerely wishing you the best.\nFrom email:",
