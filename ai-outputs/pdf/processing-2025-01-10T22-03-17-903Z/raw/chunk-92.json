  "text": "But to this point we have each dug in hard. There is only one POV, it’s mine, and it’s right! But that never really works. And it has proven to be even\nmore destructive than the original sin that got us into this place. We are repeating the pattern.\nBut I hope, that the two people who raised three kids and dreamed of forever can find the time to start communicating again. Perhaps show some\nhumanity for each other. And agree this was not on purpose. Blaming each other will never help us.\nWe had our reasons for making the decisions we did. But we see now that they were driven by bad data and incorrect assumptions. We stopped\ncommunicating and got it all wrong.\nI’ve made my point. And because I’m learning, and trying to get better now that I know, I am not asking for anything. I just wanted to share my\nperspective.\nIt is my hope however that after 30 years of doing a bad job on both sides of being honest and compassionate, that we consider creating a safe place.\nOne that helps us understand how we got here, in the hope we never do it again.\nYou are our cycle breaker. The hero! We have a plan now to course correct- every problem we had but this one. Lets not throw it away or minimize\nthis. Let’s take advantage of your bravery. Let’s put something positive together that leaves us with a legacy we can both be proud of and we take\nforward as a win.\nLet’s start with compassion for what the other is feeling and not start by blaming, let’s communicate honestly with each other again,  let’s give each\nother the space to heal separately without constructing a wall. And in good time let’s find a safe space and setting to compare notes and start to heal.\nMessage 327 of 4024\nSorry. I have so little experience with Only Fans I get OF and OFW mixed up sometimes\nSent:01/08/2024 at 10:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Packages/Mail/IRS refund check\nMessage 328 of 4024\nToday was a shit ton of work. Tomorrow will be the same. I’m done for the night trying to sort and organize and it will be a repeat tomorrow and go\ninto the weekend. Plus I have a bunch of assembly I need to do for the man cave.\nI’m going to cancel Wed/Thurs appointments and sort things before I throw more into the equation. We can swap bed sets next week. I’ll just use the\nbeach couch to save money and then think about a decent kitchen table and chairs instead.\nThen maybe we move the beach table and chairs over to the garage instead of the couch as we had considered at the same time we swap beds. Please\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns that I can address.\nI feel like you are being a great partner in this effort and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. We will all be much happier when we are settled and\nonly need to work together on basic, regular kid stuff. I can’t wait!\nThank you!\nSent:01/09/2024 at 12:06 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:52 AM)\nSubject:LUGGs",
