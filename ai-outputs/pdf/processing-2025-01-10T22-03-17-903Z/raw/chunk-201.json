You have said that on many occasions. Like over and over. How did you spend almost 15k on a card you\nassured me that you don’t use. I can find the many emails you said that in if your memory is failing as it has since July 4th.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 09:23 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 09:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card\nMessage 730 of 4024\nYou are clearly reading the messages and choosing not to use the platform of your choice to communicate.
