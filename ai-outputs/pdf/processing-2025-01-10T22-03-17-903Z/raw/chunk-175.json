You blocked me before you even saw my note saying I was moving back here and my thoughts. Did you even see my text to you and Elsa?\nF,  Christine. I did just as you asked and even said I was stopping our texts but you did not even give me the chance to be kind and constructive. Why\ndo you do that? F!!!!

Why do you feel the need to shit on every accomplishment we make? And they are far and few between\nnow. Why do you insist on creating conflict in the shadow of success? I just don’t get why you are so compelled to behave that way. Christ, Christine.\nCan’t you even for a brief moment allow anything positive in our life? I just don’t get it. Do you hate our children that much?\nSent:01/22/2024 at 10:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Well Shit",
