His big Santa gift needs to be hooked up to his computer.\nI’ll keep you in the loop. Thanks for being so flexible today.\nI really appreciate the partnership,Christine.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 11:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 11:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Pick up\nMessage 49 of 4024\nOk. Have him text me and if I’m on a hike or out and about I’ll ask him to Uber.\nI don’t plan to be on this app all day so assume future communications will just be emergencies.\nMy perspective is you are using it to reach out more than normal then add a question where you will say you needed a response.\nSent:12/25/2023 at 11:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 11:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Pick up\nMessage 50 of 4024\nWe agree. I think we need to dial it WAY back.\nHopefully it was just because there was so much planning and details we did not think about. I think it will behoove us to really be sure we include as\nmuch needed info in the first back and forth, rather than a death by a 1k cuts, fine tuning later.\nWe have the right tool, let’s learn how to use it right and use it to our mutual advantage. I’m also learning more about things like the “tone meter” and\nscheduling. I’ll share in one go instead of piecemeal as I was tempted to do initially.\nIf there is an emergency I’ll text you. Otherwise I don’t plan to be pinging you here during my time. Thanks!\nSent:12/25/2023 at 11:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2023 at 11:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Pick up\nMessage 51 of 4024\nI’m heading to barre this am.
