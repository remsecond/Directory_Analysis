Now you turned off my Xfinity, say you can’t see it (how do I know?) and are arguing about our sons mental health like you\nmake all the decisions. I’ve tried all day, bent over backwards and it feels like you are just popping on me. I asked so many times to help. Now it’s my\nproblem because whatever you did?\nBTW- if you really think a help desk is a techie, and does anything more than type your into a LLM chat bot to regurgitate it to you I’d be happy to\nexplain why they make minimum wage in 3rd world countries.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 558 of 4024\nIt is slow, inefficient, we get wound up and we are not\ngetting a anywhere. If you won’t fix the account you took over or work with me on ADs health decision in a more reasonable way, I’m not sure what I\ncan do. We have gone back and forth on this trash app for over an hour of our life we will never get back. You clearly are\nmaking every decision (including the one to use this) and it’s not getting us anywhere. Please let me know when you want to work with me, share\ndecision making and work more effectively.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:30 PM)\nSubject:This is dumb and pointless\nMessage 559 of 4024\nCan you send me the account number.
