The fact that you have not provided these details and we are on day 5 since it was discovered is alarming.\nI have communicated we are terrified and feel very unsafe with what may be out there and what may continue to be occurring.\nThe fact that you showed up to the game and waved acting like everything should be fine shows a complete lack of understanding and awareness.\nWe have asked for immediate disclosure of all items I outlined. You have refused for 5 days and it continues. That is on the record.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 04:39 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 04:48 PM)\nSubject:Disclosures\nMessage 420 of 4024\nPlease sent Xfinity’s account details to log in\nMy work computer has strangely been unable to connect to the dolce vita account since Friday.
