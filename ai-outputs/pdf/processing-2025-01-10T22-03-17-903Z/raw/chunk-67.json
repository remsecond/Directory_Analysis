It is not an emergency.\nStating you are not getting a response to OFW in 1.5 hours for non emergency items as reason to text me, is unreasonable. Interactions with you,\nespecially in person or over the phone are contentious so I have asked to stop and move to this platform.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 07:30 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 07:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Confirming Events\nMessage 238 of 4024\nHappy Birthday\nPlans for today as I understand.\nYou will pick up Adrian and Dylan after school.\nDylan to be dropped off at his house.\nAdrian to spend the day/evening with you.\nTBD if Adrian spends the night.\nSki ride program emailed me yesterday and thought they could accommodate the switch to Sunday but wanted more details on his age etc. If they\nconfirm today, plan is for Adrian to spend the night and I pick up at 9am on Saturday.\nIf I do not receive a confirmation on the switch, I will pick up Adrian at 8:30pm tonight so he can attend ski lesson Saturday am.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 07:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/05/2024 at 07:24 AM)\nSubject:Adrian today\nMessage 239 of 4024\nSki lesson confirmed moved to Sunday.\nI will plan on Adrian spending the night with you and pick up at 9am tomorrow unless you let me know otherwise.\nSent:01/05/2024 at 07:54 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/05/2024 at 07:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian today",
