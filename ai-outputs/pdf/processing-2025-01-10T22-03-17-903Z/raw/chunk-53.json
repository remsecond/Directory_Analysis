I want to acknowledge my part in tonightâ€˜s fight. It escalated quickly and got heated. We do not need to do that. I will call as soon as I get\nhome like we discussed for one purpose only. If it is not related to that purpose we wwill stop the call immediately. I would like to propose a\ntechnique that we can both employ just like you proposed OFW rules. If we agree, it should eliminate future conflicts of this nature and we can go\nback to constructive discussions only.\nThank you!\nSent:01/02/2024 at 08:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 08:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball practice Tuesday Jan 2\nMessage 193 of 4024\nYou made your point.\nI made my point.\nAnd we agreed to stop.\nI hope that will work for us.\nThank you!\nSent:01/02/2024 at 08:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 07:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball practice Tuesday Jan 2",
