Please do so.\nSent:01/18/2024 at 09:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 09:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Finalize Plans\nMessage 527 of 4024\nI have emailed you several times, perhaps 8?\nIt’s the things we discussed today that we need to finish. And I’ve asked you that we do that.\nSent:01/18/2024 at 09:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 09:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Finalize Plans\nMessage 528 of 4024\nOk. You have obviously gone dark again. Setting us up to keep at this for another week or so.\nIt’s funny how you say “I asked you to do this” and I have many times as you noted to your attorney.\nAnd when I say “I asked you to do this “ which is what we need to do, only your ask of me matters.\nYou expect me to do things that you are unwilling to do. It’s pretty rich. But we will keep at it for a few more weeks since that is what you want!\nAwesome.\nSent:01/18/2024 at 09:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/18/2024 at 09:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Finalize Plans\nMessage 529 of 4024\nThe block should not have impacted email.\nI have not seen it.\nI will put as much as I can in the truck. Priority and none priority.\nAgain these emails demanding we discuss are very coercive and manipulative. It’s all documented so it establishes a pattern on your end of constant\nharassment.\nI will discuss as you demand but make it clear it is to stop the constant harassment.\nIt will be made clear that it should and must stop\nSent:01/18/2024 at 09:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 07:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Finalize Plans",
