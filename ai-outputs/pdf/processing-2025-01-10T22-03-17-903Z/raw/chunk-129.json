You have nothing to be concerned about Christine. I would never\never do anything to you. Period. Hell, I still love you and if we could get into therapy and talk through the issues I would in a heartbeat. We can stick\nto the script.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 11:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 11:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apartment\nMessage 473 of 4024\nWow... got a shit ton done.
