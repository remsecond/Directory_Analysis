It seems sloppy and incomplete. It also captures little to none of our discussion as I mentioned. I’d\nlike to get this and our communication expectations across the finish line.\nThis has dragged on for months now and has been the source of incredible friction and has contributed to situations that are inappropriate for the\nkids to bear witness to. I just want to move on. I want to finalize this asap.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:07 AM)\nSubject:Final Draft Review\nMessage 92 of 4024\nWe are going in circles. We go over it every time we do our list. It is always the same and we agree. The order of operations goes like this:\n- We finalize the parenting plan\n- We get out of the Alki place\n- I get an Eastside place\n- I move my things to said place\n- Our problem is solved\nWe are still stuck on the first item as you won’t work with me. You know that. Instead your offer was to send all of my things to a PO Box. Why won’\nt you work with me and let me go?\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 93 of 4024\nI have a break today 11:30.

Not sure how that would slip your mind after the explosion\nyesterday for reminding you but so be it.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:10 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Final Draft Review",
