Can we play by the rules and keep that option?\nMessage 633 of 4024\nI’ll need to think about it.\nThe email thread on OFW devolved into something that I’ve seen happen on texts and calls. It moved away from AAA to something completely\ndifferent based on your interpretation.\nI am not willing to do that unless I have confidence it will not. I don’t see that at this point in time.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 01:35 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 01:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: You blocked me again?\nMessage 634 of 4024\nI just said that all of my stuff was dumped from organized drawers (not in the drawer, but by drawer). You may say you have a different perspective\non if you did that. But you did. And I can show you that you did. Just like any number of things you have done to me, denied you did, but I can show\nyou with proof. So if I can prove it with 100% certainty, like I have shown you before, I don’t see that as a poke. And I see your denial as just you\nbeing you. Deny the facts even if there are pictures. Sound familiar?\nSent:01/22/2024 at 01:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 01:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA\nMessage 635 of 4024\nWe have a real world example sitting right in front of us. I tell you all the time that we don’t schedule our emergencies. Turns out it’s true!\nOFW was your platform of choice and I kept text pristine. Respecting your ask of me. It’s not right to apply a transitive property to this.\n- I did what you asked\n- You see that we need it\n- You should have confidence\nCan we confirm we will keep that line of communication open per our mutual guidelines.\nThanks!\nSent:01/22/2024 at 01:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 02:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: You blocked me again?\nMessage 636 of 4024\n?\nSent:01/22/2024 at 03:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 03:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: You blocked me again?",
