If there was a concern it would have been nice to\nunderstand that and address it directly and in the moment so there was no misunderstanding. I am more than transparent and always willing to speak\nto any concerns that either of you may have. That is how we should be working together in a harmonious way.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 376 of 4024\nIt will all come out and unfortunately Adrian will be pulled in based on your response\nI am clear on next steps.\nI’ll let lawyers handle from here.My lawyer was very clear. Your proposal was unfortunate but that is how you are choosing to proceed.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 12:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 12:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 377 of 4024\nThis should probably be a separate thread...\nI’d like to chat with you at some point when you feel comfortable in the future. Not about this. More about how the two people in June turned into\nJanuary. It’s in no way about blame or finger pointing. It is more an acknowledgment of both our deep shared disappointment. In ourselves for\nwaiting so long, and each other as we try to find blame for a lost dream shared. Based on what I’ve learned, it’s an absolutely logical evolution from\ndeep love to the acidic hate we share now. It is a testament to how true our affection was for each other. Unfortunately, we now see that same flame\nburns equally hot on both sides of hope and disappointment. It’s likely not going to solve anything, but a deeper understanding of the human\ncondition might ease our mind and help us make more compassionate decisions. After all, they say that the “truth will set you free.”\nAs I mentioned, clearly not for now. But please let me know when you might consider some reflection.\nSent:01/13/2024 at 06:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/13/2024 at 06:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg today\nMessage 378 of 4024\nCan you set one up for Monday.
