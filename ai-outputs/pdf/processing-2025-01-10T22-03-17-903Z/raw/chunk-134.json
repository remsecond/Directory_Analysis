Let’s put our differences aside and\nlet’s just reassure him that we will sort our stuff out, but he is never going to be out in the middle.

How could I?\nYou won’t tell me the big secret.\nAnd he is asking to see me now.\nDoes that factor into the equation?\nSent:01/17/2024 at 03:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 03:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 499 of 4024\nI do not know if I can figure it out.
