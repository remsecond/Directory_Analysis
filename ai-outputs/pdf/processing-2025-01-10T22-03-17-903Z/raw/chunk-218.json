If you want to send your responses to my\nasks here you are welcome but I won’t engage in those discussions anymore.\nPremera can walk you through how to submit the Luis bills and re submit Yurishka bill for reimbursement. As Yurishka is from last year you will have\na limited time to do so. I am also uncertain if you sent the doc from my work to get the cobra portion of me and kids insurance reimbursed that was\nerroneously charged.I have not seen any more charges so you may also want to check you are still paying the cobra premium for your insurance\nthrough msft.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 07:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 08:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 795 of 4024\nI can’t do this now, please!!\nSent:01/25/2024 at 08:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 08:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 796 of 4024\nPlease hold on\nSent:01/25/2024 at 08:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 08:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!",
