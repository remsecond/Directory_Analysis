I have made it clear I have no desire to meet in person due to\nthe anxiety it causes.\nI will not discuss in person as it is not documented and devolves into arguments.\nIf you have made it clear next steps please put in writing in OFW.\nI am waiting on Dr. Brown outreach but you said no.\nSAAS I will reach out end of week.\nStarting my day.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD\nMessage 657 of 4024\nIm just asking if you have a blue green glassy baby. Why are you harassing me for that? If you don’t want me to ask a simple question like that just say\nso.\nI don’t need the courts to stop. All you have to do is say it. We have been working together as a team, side by side on this move, and had a lovely and\nproductive time just 12 hours ago. Can we just continue that trajectory instead of you making some argument for a legal restraint? We just helped\neach other.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Flagging: Glassy Baby\nMessage 658 of 4024\nThanks for",
