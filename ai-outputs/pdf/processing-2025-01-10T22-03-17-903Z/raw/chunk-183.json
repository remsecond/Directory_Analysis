  "text": "Message 664 of 4024\nAdrian is my son. You have neither sole legal custody or a parenting plan that you agree to follow. Given those two things, and the insistence on\ndefying any commonly accepted standard parenting practices,\nI am asking to be involved in decisions about what he is doing, with who, and how he gets back and forth. If we had a parenting plan, I would\nconsider it to be your time, and not bother. But we don’t. So I am making a documented request that I’m involved in these decisions about my\nchildren.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:23 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 665 of 4024\nWhy did you call before then? It makes zero sense. Nothing you have done since Juily 4th has.\nYou asked on OFW why we needed to chat. I told you. You called. Then said you can't chat.\nPlease help me understand what that means? It makes no sense at while a locksmith is there.\nOr are you busy explaining that you are married but it has never mattered to you. Stick that key in!\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:26 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Please call me\nMessage 666 of 4024\nGiven the serious concerns Adrian raised regarding the surveillance , I paused the plan we initially aligned in, and requested to regroup with Dr.\nBrown to factor the impacts.\nYou have refused to move forward on that.\nPlease make any requests via your lawyer and we can let them handle if you have concerns with the current situation.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:27 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Basketball today\nMessage 667 of 4024\nI’ll do 12:30-1:30 if you and the locksmith are done by then\nSent:01/23/2024 at 09:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 09:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Please call me",
