They always ask that.\nYou took my soulemate, my lover, my kids, and my house. Please don’t take my opportunity to start over.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 01:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 02:32 PM)\nSubject:Restraining Orde\nMessage 688 of 4024\nI’m there now.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 02:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 02:33 PM)\nSubject:Please join the call\nMessage 689 of 4024\nYou agreed to the restraining order knowing the impacts.\nGiven the escalation of tone in emails, texts, calls, it was prudent to put in place additional guardrails around communications .\nThis morning’s email was just another example of an unwanted and disturbing communication that was intended to cause distress and disrupt. It had\nnothing to do with kids or other areas we are navigating.\nI am hopeful we can focus on moving forward in a constructive manner. OFW will be the tool.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 02:37 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 03:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: Restraining Orde\nMessage 690 of 4024\nI am asking to please discuss this before you ruin my life. We had agreed to work together after that email. That gave me the impression that we could\nmove forward and make progress. So when I saw things getting testy, I asked to stop it. I was doing the right thing.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 03:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 03:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Restraining Orde",
