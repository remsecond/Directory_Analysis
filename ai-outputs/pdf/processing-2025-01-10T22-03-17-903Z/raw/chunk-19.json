Please let me know if you see anything you disagree with or note as\nmissing. We could also send this to her for confirmation after we agree. Once we are signed off I can start investigating and lining up how we proceed.\nLet's get right!\nThanks!\nbest\n1 Dialectical Behavioral Therapy program\n- Christine will participate for at least 6 months\n- Robert will participate for 12 months\nResources: Eastside DBT, Thira, EBT Seattle, and the Seattle Clinic are good options.\nNotes: We can talk about if we do it at the same place. Does not need to be same person.\n2 Marriage counseling\n- Christine and Robert- Not to stay together, but to peacefully coexist for the kid's sake.\nResources: We can consider Debbie or someone else.\nNotes: Important to get the details from Dr Brown. Let's discuss how to do that.\n3 Child Therapy\n- Max and Adrian should go to this as soon as possible. Therapist should have the final parenting plan.\nResources: Kari Betts is who I have reached out to or someone else.\nNotes: Let's decide if we want to go with her.\n4 Substance Use Counseling\n- Christine should be allowed a session with a substance use professional\n- Robert goes once per week with a provider who specializes in working with addiction\nResources: New Life or perhaps one of the places where we do DBT since they coexist so often\nNotes: Robert to investigate and talk to Christine\n5 Child Led Reunification Therapy\n- Robert, Max and Adrian\nResources: None suggested\nNotes: Perhaps we ask Dr Brown or Kari Betts for recommendations.\nSent:12/27/2023 at 02:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 04:20 PM)\nSubject:Therapy Roundup",
