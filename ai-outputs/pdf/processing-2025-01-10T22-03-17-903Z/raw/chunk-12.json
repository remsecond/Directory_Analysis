You are refusing to bring him down stating I was off this platform for. 21 hours. Very confrontational. I am moving off\ntext to document.\nYou are suggesting to bring him back to the Kirkland home with no time stated and that you need packages that I do not see. You saw my message and\nchose not to respond.\nDr. Brown suggested no pick ups and drop off at residences. You are located in an apartment tower so there is not a threat of me entering your\nresidence. You are stating you will come directly to the house which I do not agree to.\nI will move this to lawyers as this is not working and you are not following Dr. Brown guidelines\nSent:12/26/2023 at 10:10 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2023 at 10:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: Pick up\nMessage 54 of 4024\nI will not replying to this point by point. When I do, it seems to always make the matter worse. We have different perspectives and I do not wish to\ninflame either our relationship or this situation. And I certainly don’t want a repeat of what just transpired.\nWe had a plan. It worked yesterday and came off the rails during pick up. We honestly don’t need to argue or expose the children to adult situations.\nMaybe thats where we start? But I think it’s about getting back to the way we worked together yesterday.\nWe will chat later before 1:00 as agreed. So let me know when. My humble suggestion is that you let me know what you want and expect to make this\na healthy relationship for the kids. And even us. We need tools in our box more than ever before.\nI promise to bring a healthy, optimistic, can do attitude to our discussion. I also assure you that nothing that happened in the past will be used as\nmaterial- no retribution. I only want to sincerely and calmly discuss moving forward. Golden Rule!\nThanks for the opportunity to be healthy for the kids and hopefully even us!\nSent:12/26/2023 at 10:30 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2023 at 10:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Pick up",
