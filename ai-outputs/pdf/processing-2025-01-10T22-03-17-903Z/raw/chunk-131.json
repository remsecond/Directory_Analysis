Given the  concerns he raised to me I don’t feel comfortable until it has been addressed with assistance with a\nprofessional. I was waiting to finalize next steps with lawyers as this is a serious issue but it seems your side is not interested in any further response. I\nam not going to debate on this platform. It is serious and needs to be treated as such. I am appalled that Adrian was witness and pulled into this. He\nknows i am working on addressing it.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 02:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 02:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 483 of 4024\nSo it’s frustrating dealing with you. You never respond to what I have said. Ever. I did not say you put him in the middle of this. Just like I did not say\nI needed to enter the house to move when I suggested FaceTime instead. You respond to words you want me to have said so you can justify a fight. It’\ns unproductive. We have to go back and forth and show you I never said it, putting the real issue on pause. Then you get pissed when you realize that,\nand cut off communication so the issue is never addressed.\nIf there was inappropriate behavior of any sort I should be alerted. That’s the way things should work as parents of shared children. You say it was\nappalling and he should have never seen it like this is some sort of porn situation. But again you won’t tell me what it is. What if whatever he thinks he\nsaw actually has a reasonable explanation? Is there any possibility that he might have not understood what he was seeing? Because I sure as hell did not\nopen any of your nudie pics, our Amazon shopping history of kinky bondage and sex toys, or your hidden KO folder of pics and gifts swapped. And\nthat is the only thing I can think of that meets this bar.\nWrt to Lawyers, I have been telling you that we should connect for a week. I think just presuming that there is no interest or I have been dumped as a\nclient is again, you making things up in your own mind. I have tried to communicate for a week now. But somehow you are 100% privy to everything\nand I’m totally in the dark. Don’t you think there is an issue there? Is this really serving our best interests to say that we are not interested in trying to\nresolve your super top secret, unshared, black box event that only you and AD can know, but not me, the parent who supposedly did it?\nSent:01/17/2024 at 02:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 02:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 484 of 4024\nHe is asking to come over right now.\nSent:01/17/2024 at 02:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 02:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nAttachments:IMG_0927.PNG (2 MB)",
