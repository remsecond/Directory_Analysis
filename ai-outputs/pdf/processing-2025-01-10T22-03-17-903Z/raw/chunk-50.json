You escalated a conversation just now, hung up for no reason, and acted like I was\nescalating. You create a false narrative for your own needs. I need to be able to have contact for the safety of my kids as we agreed. So moving off of\nthis until we agree that we will follow the plan that was laid out.\nSent:01/02/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Moving back off OFW\nMessage 177 of 4024\nMove everything to OFW from now on.

I think in our parenting plan it discusses undermining each other. And that includes too friends of our child’s\nparents. Specifically in this case, you lied to me and you told me that you had not told our deepest and dearest friends of 16 years. But I found out\nwhen they texted me about how I was doing. You always lie about anything that you want but then have a clever excuse that it’s all justified. So when\nyou are violating the terms of our parenting plan, undermining me as it stipulates not to, and lying about it, that becomes an issue for me.\nSent:01/02/2024 at 05:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 05:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock me\nMessage 179 of 4024\nWe are all or none on the parenting plan\nSent:01/02/2024 at 05:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/02/2024 at 05:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moving back off OFW",
