Thank you\nSent:12/27/2023 at 04:21 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2023 at 04:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 83 of 4024\nGood stuff.\n- Sometime tomorrow, I can send our Therapy questions to Dr. Brown. Let me know if you would\nlike to approve it before sending it.\n- The next topic is the last draft. Not sure if you reviewed it, but it's sloppy and incomplete, IMHO.\nShould I start a separate thread?\nSent:12/27/2023 at 04:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 84 of 4024\nI’m fine with you sending the therapy questions to Dr. Brown.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:02 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy Roundup\nMessage 85 of 4024\nThat was one of the two questions. I’d like to minimize our back and forth.

The room is booked for April 6 - 13.\nI propose I take the boys this year. Max and you will still be in unification therapy and there is no concrete plan to address what Dr. Brown posed as\nhow do boys feel safe in a foreign country with no ability to escape, if your anger, or sobriety where to relapse.\nTickets are very expensive so I would need to book quickly.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 07:08 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 07:09 AM)\nSubject:Spring Break (not urgent)",
