We never lived off salary and always paid bills from stock and bonus. They will be due again soon.\nMessage 209 of 4024\nDetails sent to Hotmail.\nI do not want to argue with you. We had a plan to nest. Period. That was our plan of record. You decided that Yurushka’s label was appropriate and I\nwon’t argue that point or the change in perspective.\nBut prior to that, whatever we had then, it was ok to nest. But you have changed your mind. That is fine. But I understand our history, it’s and our\nevolution so to me it’s still confusing. But I accept that.\nYes. Divorce is expensive. I hope we can get a handle on our relationship well enough to work collaboratively together. I want to partner with you so\nplease let me know how to do you feel safe.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 10:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 10:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nMessage 210 of 4024\nYou still do not recognize the DV aspect of the relationship.

I agree. And I don’t agree that I asked you to hide anything. If our relationship was not normal for 29 years, I would have expected a\nconversation.\nBut I don’t want to fight. Period. I’d like to understand it better as we had planned to do, but am willing to wait on your timeline. That’s most\nimportant now.\nJust because you decide to change your perspective, did not mean I stopped wanting to improve and be the best husband and father I could be to us.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 11:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 11:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List",
