  "text": "Message 653 of 4024\nI think we have been clear on all counts what we need to do next. Please don’t play your games on OFW like you give a crap about anything I say. It’s\nfake, insincere, and insulting. You make every decision as if I am not a parent at all. I get you are just trying to F with me to show your lawyer but we\nhave documented discussions where I have made my asks clear on these topics- SAAS, therapist, Dr. Brown. When you have time to discuss the well\nbeing of our children instead of playing the documentation game let me know. We can wrap this up.\nI don’t get you and actually think something is wrong with you mentally. Friday and again yesterday we killed it. Made a ton of progress working\ntogether. But by the time you hit the bridge you brought it to a screaming halt. And now you start this BS on OFW with an email “last call “ blast. I\nreally do think you will find any reason to screw with me and use the kids as pawns in your glorious, narcissistic grand plan.\nLet me know when you want to quit playing again. Because this is a waste of time and you know it.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD\nMessage 654 of 4024\nSo? Do you have a blue green one or not? Going on their site makes me physically and emotionally ill. The reminder is actually f’ing disgusting to me.\nSo I’d prefer to use one we already have rather than do that.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:22 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Glassy Baby",
