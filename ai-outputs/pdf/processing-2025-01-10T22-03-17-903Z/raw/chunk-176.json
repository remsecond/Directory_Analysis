  "text": "Message 647 of 4024\nGotta say, I pretty much nailed you when I sent this at 2:30 am. As soon as you got what you wanted tonight, and we killed it together, you had to\nprove\nme right. You did exactly as predicted by the time you hit the West Seattle bridge. You have to admit it’s crazy how predictable you are.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 10:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: I realized this weekend..\nMessage 648 of 4024\nI have been clear communications will be in OFW.

You lack the decency and backbone to even notify me. On the very day we both saw we\nneeded to communicate with urgency. So you block me without telling me, and don’t check OFW for 10.5 hours. That’s rich\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:03 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:04 AM)\nSubject:Re: I realized this weekend..\nMessage 651 of 4024\nI reached out to therapist again.\nI’ll wait to hear back from you re Dr. Brown.\nFor SAAS, I’ll reach out end of week if I don’t hear back from you on that end.\nSent:01/23/2024 at 08:04 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 08:04 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD",
