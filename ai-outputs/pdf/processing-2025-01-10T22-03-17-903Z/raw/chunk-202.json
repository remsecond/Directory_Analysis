I have not touched anything since that last lugg move. You were aware of items that were moved. In light of\nconcerns of recording devices and monitoring equipment hidden in residence, I would like to move these items out of the house as I am uncertain if\nin your belongings.\nThere is still hidden a router that is broadcasting a WiFi signal and the hidden Blink modules that I haven’t located.\nParenting. The children have expressed concern in regards to safety. I suggested Dr. Brown to assist navigating. You are refusing on this platform\ndespite communication from your lawyer of plan to proceed with this approach.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 11:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 11:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items\nMessage 736 of 4024\nThere are still some items that hit that account but I have moved majority to BofA. Some items likely hit the Amex when BofA did not have enough\ncash and we needed credit to cover.\nCan you move your charges that currently hit the Chase card to your Amex or fidelity to track spend.\nI have tried use BofA debit for household and kids expenses.\nWe will both need to provide details of all cc spend for all cards when we do financial disclosures.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 11:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 11:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card",
