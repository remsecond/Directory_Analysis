  "text": "Message 582 of 4024\nI asked you to work with me about six hours ago. I worked with Xfinity as noted, to make you as the sole owner of 1210, and made sure I moved\nDiamond status to your account. So did my best to set you up for success. And asked you to confirm you were happy with the new private set up.\nIt is approaching midnight. You stopped communicating and I still have no working bed to sleep on and no internet access. You have changed the\npassword and even though I’m listed as the owner now, I can’t get in because of the password change that you made. And they need to know why I\nwant to reverse something you did intentionally with them.\nI told you that you took over my account all afternoon. We have so many mails on it back and forth. You said you were working with fraud and it\nwould be 24-48 hours. I kept asking just to call me so we could tag team like we had successfully all day. I know this stuff. But you still refused.\nI made sure you were totally dialed in. Set up Lugg moves on the fly. You sent junk to my place after we agreed not to do that, sent me a bed that is flat\nso I can’t sleep on it, a TV you know I need the remote for and are the only with access to my WiFi. Sheesh Christine. You are actively monitoring me\nnow (and we know we both know how it works) and sleeping on my bed with me on a couch.\nTbh this is really messed up. Like what do I need to do to get my admin access back from you? I showed you everything today. And got you up and\nrunnjng after you screwed it all up not following simple directions. So you know how it all works now if you paid attention. And now you can see\neverything I do, just like you were complaining about with me.\nThe difference is you have done this willingly, knowingly, and in opposition to my asks. When we shared access that was voluntary on both parts,\nwhether you knew what you were doing or not.\nBut now you know!\nI don’t want to fight. I’ll work with you to get my physical and digital property, IP, and WiFi access back. But like the kids, I’m asking to work\ntogether. It’s not right for you just to steal it all from me, monitor me, and unilaterally control access to my digital life after making such a huge stink\nover this the last ten days. You have to see that, right?\nWe don’t need to have the attorneys for this. It’s common sense. Can we please work together like when I was leading the charge today and everything\nyou asked for got done?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 11:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 06:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 583 of 4024\nThe couch is actually pretty comfy  and I have a TV that streams fine tonight. We will get Xfinity sorted. I’ll take the lead in the AM and let you\nknow what I find out. It’s not a big deal. And we can get on Dr Brown’s calendar. It’s all good. We have a bunch of stuff to do before you leave next\nweekend so let’s just make it happen.\nWe used to have a deal, for better or worse-never wake up mad. I’m proposing we fall back tomorrow to our defense mechanism. I don’t care to fight\nanother lick. I want to peacefully partner and stop my nonsense and you can make your decisions as well. I think we were so successful most of the\nday that it made you nervous and scared and made me overconfident and hopeful.\nThen the wheels came off. I am sorry for pushing blame on you and want to do better myself. I plan on doing some beach stuff tomorrow and also\nbuy a CL rug in Shoreline. We can work together or avoid each other. Your call. But if we cross paths at the beach I promise you a great bowl of\npezole or lemongrass chicken for lunch. Your call.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 01:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 06:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account",
