And you might have but it was either in the kava bowl or the wine cabinet draw.. So it’s in one of the\nmany boxes you just dumped into a bag. That is the way all my stuff arrived. It’s gonna take weeks to figure where the shit came from and locate what\nI knew the exact placement was before.\nSo now we have situations like this and you are washing your hands clean of the shit show related to this along with your affair with Kevin Otero,\nhiding an lying about it to me, and then blowing up the Moyer family. Have a freaking spine. Own something you did wrong, anything, like the\nXfinity account. You just are not capable or big enough to ever find the least bit of fault with yourself.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 12:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 12:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA\nMessage 627 of 4024\nThe Kava bowl disappeared a long time ago.\nA AAA card in a drawer or bowl in the house would not have been helpful to you nor would I have had access to it sitting at work.\nI gave you exactly what you need below.\nI thought you said you would not poke? That is exactly what your last paragraph is.\nSent:01/22/2024 at 12:33 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 12:34 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA\nMessage 628 of 4024\nSo... again. You started this by poking me. Explaining how you could bear no fault and any inconvenience is of my own making. It’s the thing I keep\nnoting whenever you scold me for my disgruntled replies. Don’t poke first and I don’t poke back? What about that is so hard to understand?\nSent:01/22/2024 at 12:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Triple AAA",
