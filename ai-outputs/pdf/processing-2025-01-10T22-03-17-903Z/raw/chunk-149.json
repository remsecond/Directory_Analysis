Please take time to review the add-ons. And I am more than happy to help you pick the right data plan. I made some great choices here and\nwould be happy to share with you so you find the right solution at the right price! Just let me know if I can do anything!\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kirkland xfinity account\nMessage 548 of 4024\nHmmm... you have been in OFW to send mails but you are not checking or responding to my concerns about treating Adrian’s mental health. Please\ntake a moment to consider that we both should work together on mental health issues just like a decision we would make in an emergency room\nsetting. Can we work together?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 549 of 4024\nI’m managing work and changing accounts.\nI can reach out to Dr Brien or you can.

I don’t want to do that. That is not the way we are expected to behave as genetic parents.\nIf you are going to proceed that way of course I am strongly frowning on the omnipotent power play suggestion.\nAnd I recognize you are balancing his mental health with your work. I guess something has to give. But I’d still like to be involved just like if we are\ndeciding to remove his appendix. So please let me know if you can make the time to discuss. Hopefully you will free up for a moment soon. I’ll make\nit work on my end.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 551 of 4024\nWhat is your suggestion? If we talk let’s use the feature in OFW moving forward\nSent:01/19/2024 at 04:03 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock",
