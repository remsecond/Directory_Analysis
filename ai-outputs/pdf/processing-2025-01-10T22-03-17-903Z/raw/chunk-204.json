I will need to address your dishonesty later.\nThe truth is, you don’t know what the truth is. You lie with every communication. If you need evidence, I am happy to start documenting here.\nJust let me know. It will be easy to do but take a really long time to just cover the items since July 4th. Obviously I can send digital evidence as I have it\nall documented for your convenience.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW\nMessage 744 of 4024\nYou are welcome to do as you like. I would not recommend it as I have employed a strategy that has netted us ~55% over the last year. But you do you.\nI have told you on numerous occasions to just let me know when we need cash. I like to generate income as long as possible. I have never delayed a\ntransfer.\nI’m not trying to argue but I don’t get how there could be more spend since you stopped in October. And especially ~15k. I trust you, but it makes no\nsense.\nHappy to move to Amex too like you. I was just doing so much on Amazon that it seemed like a sound decision. Do you feel like that is not the case!\nI understand what we will need to provide. Why are you telling me that? We also are supposed to have a parenting plan in place. That has never\nmattered.\nIf you want to have an all up “Running List” discussion I would like to at your convenience. I assume you have to initiate, I will be kind, and it would\nhelp.\nThis OFW thing is fine. I am happy to abide by it so you feel safe. That is super important. But I hope you can still use the phone so we can really\nprogress.\nWith all that’s going on, especially w.r.t. to the kids mental health it would be much easier to sort ahead of time rather than in front of them. I promise\nto be kind and constructive.\nAnd if I am not, end the call. No second chances. But for you and the kids I assure you I will be on my Monday night behavior. When I honestly\nthought we started a new chapter of cooperation till we did the opposite. Please consider.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Credit Card",
