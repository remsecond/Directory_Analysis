Saying the same thing over and over does not make it true. You said you were going through your lawyer and you have not given me a single\nchance to respond. You only just told me today. How the hell am I supposed to respond??? Please let me help! I really am trying but you won’t let me.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Disclosures\nMessage 430 of 4024\nI know what I said below. And I have explained that I can speak to this issue. You won’t allow me to.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 05:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 05:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Disclosures\nMessage 431 of 4024\nI’m getting pinged tonight for a 1st round Thursday and I have a 2nd round on Wednesday. I have your ask from this afternoon of course, but I’m\nstill in the dark on what it means. I know you mentioned some sliding scale that I am totally unaware of but it sounds like you are going DV no matter\nwhat I say. If you can confirm I’ll cancel with some dignity. If/when this gets worked out in the future, they are both with companies that I really\ndon’t want to be blackballed from. I’m not blaming you, I’m just trying to gracefully adjust to the situation without burning all my bridges.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 07:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 08:15 PM)\nSubject:Recruiter\nMessage 432 of 4024\nYour lawyer was trying to mitigate for you to I think try avoid what you describe below. We made our ask and you are refusing and unwilling to\nprovide this information despite what you say can be explained easily.\nIf you prefer to easily explain this away in front of the court/judge after we file our order, when you could do so on the front end easily, as you say,\nthat’s an interesting strategy but one it appears you have thought through with your lawyer.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 08:25 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 08:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter",
