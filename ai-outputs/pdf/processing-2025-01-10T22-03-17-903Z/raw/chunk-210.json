  "text": "Message 766 of 4024\nI’m frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of things this am. Can you please let me know if the RO prevents you from calling me to discuss?\nI intentionally tried not to limit you in any way so we could have that flexibility when we needed it. You keep saying that calling me would violate the\nRO.\nIs that really true, or are you just saying that is true. Just wanting to work with you in a constructive way so I’d love to confirm what you have said.\nMuch appreciated!!! Looking forward to cleaning up some of these outstanding issues. Especially the really messy ones we need to partner on.\nThanks Again!\nSent:01/25/2024 at 02:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:RO\nMessage 767 of 4024\nYes it was just confirmed RO has been filed and restricts communications with text calls email and OFW limited to co parenting related issues. You\ncan read it in the RO that was signed. .\nI intend to adhere to that.\nFor anything outside parenting issues including financial, household I was informed it should go through counsel. I will send any communications on\nthese topics to my lawyer and they will send to your lawyer and will try minimize time spent in these issues to limit bills.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 03:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 03:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: RO\nMessage 768 of 4024\nIs this really where you wanted to be after Monday?\nAll I did was show respect and hope. Now we can’t talk at all? How do we do therapy? Did you kill that too? That was part of Dr Browns\nrecommendation.\nI really hate it has come to this... I just had to hang up on AD because I started bawling and so did he. But you can see how we started. How can you\nhate me this much? Please talk to AD",
