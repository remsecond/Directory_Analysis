If you have the place Friday-Sunday, a Saturday AM drop seems like the day you wake up after checking in. So not sure it\npencils out. You would have to leave as soon as you get there. Let’s discuss.

Let’s partner.\nSent:01/03/2024 at 08:26 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/03/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Whistler Jan 26 - Jan 29",
