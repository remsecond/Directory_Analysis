I don’t see any of below as an emergency and don’t want to set a precedent for a connect.\nIf there is an emergency that we can’t deal with in OFW then that would be a forum to connect.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 05:52 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 05:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1464 of 4024\nSo are you saying that everything we discussed for the last two weeks is out the door, you don’t want to work together for peace, and the only way you\nwill meet to go over our list is in an emergency? You are just not even going to try anymore? You just want to stay enemies? Are you bailing in the Dr\nBrown advice you said you would kick off yesterday? Why do you string me along all week and then turn into someone completely different on\nFriday? Two weeks in a row\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 06:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1465 of 4024\nI’m trying to figure out what is a healthy way for interaction with you.\nAt this time I’m just not emotionally or mentally ready\nI feel the anger and resentment from you in all your texts. Why would I subject myself to that other than to calm and appease you.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 06:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1466 of 4024\nI’m on now. Give me two minutes please\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 06:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1467 of 4024\nIf you will give me the chance I can show you. If I never get the chance I cannot. Everything gets more frustrating and the issues that cause the anxiety\njust compound. Two minutes, that’s all. Please\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 06:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
