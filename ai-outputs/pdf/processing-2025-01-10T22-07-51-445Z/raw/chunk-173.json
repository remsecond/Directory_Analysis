And while we fight, until that ink dries, I owe you the respect and\ndignity to listen to my wife's feedback and be a better husband. And no matter what \"progressive\" therapists may say, I'm not dating and won't\ncommit adultery. I owe you out of respect for our 29 years. Let's do this.. till we aren't married.\nHave a great night, Christine. And sweet dreams.\nYour STILL husband for a few more months, who still wants to be better for you ..,\n- robert\nMessage 1345 of 4024\nI’ll call Xfinity this weekend to see if I can resolve. Alternatively you could call and see what they suggest.\nThank you fir letting me know\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1346 of 4024\nHi There!\nI will move on this today\nPlease also share the list.\nAdmittedly I am realizing how much my nervous system is appreciating the calm and removal of chaos in my life. It was stressful, unhelpful and\nincredibly traumatizing. That is certainly not what I want to return to.\nChristine\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:20 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1347 of 4024\nNo worries. If you’re not down trying to reverse course, that’s your prerogative. But, the chaos is due to not being able to communicate and solve\nissues.\nI appreciate the quiet too. But if you feel like trying for a more peaceful and constructive conversation is going to make things worse. It will. It’s self-\nfulfilling.\nI’ll stop this track and begin working through Lisa. Lots is housecleaning, but I reached out because I feel like we also have consequential legal issues\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
