  "text": "toast. We will have the coldest, sweetest flavored soda water choices, and I'll surprise you with a yummy dessert.\nThis helps us out by:\n- Allowing you to inspect where the boys may eventually spend the night\n- Letting you mock and criticize my taste in my \"man decor\" furnishings\n- Permitting me to cook for someone for the first time in six long months\n- Gives us time to actually have potentially game-changing conversations\n- Providing an environment more personal, where body language matters\n- Giving you an out to walk away if I ever, in any way make you uncomfortable\n- Perhaps kindling a blueprint for the way the kids could see us in the future\n- Ending the catch 22 where we can't see each other ... because we don't now\nI already know you have reservations (with me on Wed.. lol ) But I am asking you to be brave, take a chance, and let me show you I am the husband\nyou can trust and who has listened and applied your feedback. If I can't show you, we will be stuck here forever.\nThis doesn't violate our RO and could show us a future of cooperation and friendship.\nPlease, I am not trying to manipulate you, I'm trying to build a bridge. Please allow me.\nYour Wed night chef and confidant in all things Moyer Kids\n- robert\nMessage 1359 of 4024\nSince I sent this I can't think straight. I am soooo nervous. Maybe more nervous than the night I first asked you out at La Dolce vita and we ended up\nat Club 97 for strawberries and cream..\nIf you already thought \"no\" may I please implore that you re-consider. And after 29 years allow me one night of friendship with my bride. It honestly\nwould mean the world to me, Christine.\nPlease do this for us and what it could mean to our future and the Moyer kids. I promise to spoil you with kindness and consideration. Now, I'm\nballing just thinking about it  Please say yes!!!\nSent:02/13/2024 at 12:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Chat\nMessage 1360 of 4024\nI appreciate the kind and sincere invitation. I know you put a lot of effort into this and all emails.\nAs you noted I am not comfortable at this time, but I do recognize you are trying.\nAnnaLisa indicated restrictions are indeed on you.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Chat",
