  "text": "Message 1176 of 4024\nIt's unfortunate we still have to try and solve complex muti-topic issues this way post a new RO.\nHope to make my point constructively here. But I will be honest and forthcoming and hope you see this as a constructive response and not a\npersonal attack.\nAn RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified. I am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any\nviolation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I would hope you received same guidance.\n<<You have been saying that the RO was filed for a couple of weeks. But we did what we needed to do to advance our issues. Now you won't and\nhave a sudden change of heart. You were going to work with Anna Lisa to modify the RO so we could be more effective, especially acknowledging the\nneed for our \"Running List\" format. None of that happened. We are not much better off today than two weeks ago. And even after trying to resolve it\nat your request yesterday with haste, the \"no upgrade\" RO was filed.\nToday- zero progress, nothing in sight. I realize this is not business, but know you are far more capable than this. If you were 90% blocked from\neffectively doing your job, had been saying you would fix it for two weeks, came back and told Julie you didn't fix anything, you are still blocked but\nwill keep at it with no timeline or schedule even with all the help you can get, I don't see that flying tbh. I will be patient as I promised, but you\nbrought it up so just replying. >>\nFor Dr Brown, we will need to align here. She asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me. My goal is to update of\nsituation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will consider. We all have a different\nperspective on what occurred. Impact to Adrian and me was/is real. I am not going to brush aside Adrian’s concerns that he expressed to me. I’d like\nto confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we lose the spot and it gets pushed out further.\n<<We do need to align. The only context she has to define her plan of action is your email. That's it. She has no idea who and why to involve in the\ndiscussion and why? I would like to align, as I have mentioned from day one. Not just today, but every single day since this started. Only responding\nto the 10th request a day or two before we do this is not grounds for saying \"well it's too late, let's go with it.\" Further, this was about AD and I. That\nis it. We both saw it and were never given a chance to discuss or explain.\nSo now we need to discuss reunification as a result and if we handle the situation in a way, healthiest for him. And what we should do in the future. It\nis appropriate for those impacted by what AD saw- AD, Me, you, to have that conversation. No one else. This is not about relitigating something I\napologized for, and as you say, we both disagree on. Dr Brown should not be making that judgment. She is not qualified>>\nA shared proposal I hope we can both get behind and work as a team:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nwe handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns. .\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting\nplan if necessary.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 03:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",
