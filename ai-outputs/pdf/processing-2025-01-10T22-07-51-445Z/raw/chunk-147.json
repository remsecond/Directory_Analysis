It has varied because of the ski bus.\nApril 15th - if we estimate 24% of 215K = 52K at a minimum.\nJV is going to fix the holes in the fence for $400.\nI bought a new dryer using Elsa's Costco card for $850. The other one was purchased in 2005!\nI had the faucet replaced in kitchen. Bill (plumber) had 5 of them laying around. That was $495.\nGreg is going to give an estimate for replacing a broken door upstairs.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 04:30 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 04:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Support for the Family\nMessage 1266 of 4024\nMay I grab AD for practice?\nSent:02/09/2024 at 05:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 05:29 PM)\nSubject:Basketball\nMessage 1267 of 4024\nIâ€™m doing Surya before and after.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 05:29 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball",
