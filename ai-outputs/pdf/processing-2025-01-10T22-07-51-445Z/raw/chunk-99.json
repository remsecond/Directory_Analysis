Well done today, Christine. You were super helpful and I canâ€™t thank you enough for the positive teamwork and\ncooperation.\nI hope that today is a blueprint that we will use in the future. I still hold out hope for the Alyssa model for the health and success of our family and us\nas well.\nPlease call me if you see anything missing or have any questions or concerns\nSent:02/05/2024 at 02:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 02:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size\nMessage 1123 of 4024\nNot too worried because I think you said it could take up to 48 hours.
