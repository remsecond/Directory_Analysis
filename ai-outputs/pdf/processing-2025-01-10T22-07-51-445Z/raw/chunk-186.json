We can’t be expected to go on like this and I’d like to resolve amicably. Like I’d\nlike to figure out even the most basic form of communication.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:00 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1387 of 4024\nThe delay has been getting input from Dr Brown which hopefully is moving forward.\nIt was a real traumatic event that needed to be addressed.\nExpressing disappointment is fine but it feels directed at me which is what I hope you did not intend.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:02 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1388 of 4024\nIt might be a little. But we can discuss. Dr Brown not only did not do what was outlined. She went further to say she is specifically avoiding doing\nthat. Given it was your suggestion, and I wanted to work with you, I agreed. I think that was fair. But it’s so far off the rails I have not destination even\nin sight.\nAnd I agree that it was traumatizing. It was for you and I both as well. But you and I have been given a small chance at least to discuss. We still disagree\nbut we can be civil and even see each other. AD has not had that opportunity. He is shut out of both an explanation or what I have apologized for.\nThe net is it continues to fester. The fact that he can’t get a reasonable explanation from his father just reinforces the idea it was nefarious. I know you\nare doing what you think is right, but shutting out one whole side of the story and allowing him to draw his own conclusions seems\ncounterproductive.\nLet’s shine some light on this and let him decide.\nDr Brown has no intention of helping the situation.",
