You are a natural leader, charismatic, and self-\nconfident. Dragons are thought to be lucky individuals who are passionate, decisive, and do things in a grand manner. You are also perceived as being\nintelligent, enthusiastic, and have a strong sense of independence.\nSounds about right to me! Wishing you prosperity and wealth. Have a great day kicking off your year!\n-robert\nSent:02/10/2024 at 07:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 08:34 AM)\nSubject:\nMessage 1282 of 4024\nHa!
