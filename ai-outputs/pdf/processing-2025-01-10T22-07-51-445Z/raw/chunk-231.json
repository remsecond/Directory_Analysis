Now my Saturday nights are spent alone.\nMy wife left me. I’m not allowed to see my kids. So here I sit.\nAnd this is what I do now. I order a vase, some string, a few kinds of pampas (had never even heard of that before) and eucalyptus stems. I slowly put\nthem together in a way I like. It’s dumb, but gives me joy.\nI have to find pleasure in solitude. This is not what I want but after 25 years, life threw me a curve ball. I’ll never be given a chance to make it right. It\nhurts so deep. But I will find little things to make me smile.\nHope you are able to find joy as well... I always have.\nSent:02/17/2024 at 08:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:31 PM)\nSubject:It’s not Driftwood\nAttachments:IMG_1471.jpg (3 MB)\nMessage 1490 of 4024\nThank you for sharing.\nSent:02/17/2024 at 08:32 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: It’s not Driftwood\nMessage 1491 of 4024\nAside from the issues with any information technology background searches, I assume you would like me to update this as well?\nSent:02/17/2024 at 11:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/18/2024 at 07:52 AM)\nSubject:Updating my LinkedIn for Job Search\nAttachments:IMG_1478.PNG (373 KB)",
