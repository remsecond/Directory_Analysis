I am happy to set up a Zoom call for the three of us to discuss\nAdrian joining us at SAAS.\nIn the meantime, I strongly encourage you to complete the Ravenna application for Adrian so the process can start as soon as possible. We cannot\nmake enrollment decisions without an application, and we will need it regardless of a midyear transfer or entry next year. The sooner the application is\ncomplete, the better.\nI am available for a Zoom call next Thursday between 8:00 and 11:30 or Friday between 12:30 and 4:00. Would either work for you?\nThanks\nLori",
