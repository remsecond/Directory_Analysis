  "text": "Message 989 of 4024\nI'm frustrated and I want to communicate with you. We are getting a divorce because we did not do that. Can we not make our divorce shitty, and\nour kid's lives hell for the same reason?\nThe spirit of my emails is accurate. I won't repeat them. I am frustrated to see us going in circles. But it is not helpful to make passive-aggressive and\ncynical comments to make my point.\nI want to apologize for my counterproductive tone. I'd like to try and resume working together as we discussed Tuesday. And if I am frustrated by\nyou, I want to respond better than I did tonight.\nOne thing I really wish we had done, and will do even now, is follow Dr Brown's instructions to see someone. A professional who can help us\ncommunicate better.  Be kind. We did not, and here we are.\nAnd tbh, I don't want to bother with Dr Brown if we are just going to blow off her advice again. It's just a waste of time and money. Especially if we\nplan to still go to meditation in the future.\nSo I will try harder tomorrow. I hope you do too but it will not make me try less. I hope you can start to try and give a lirttle sometimes as well. But if\nyou do not, I will still try to do my best.\nWe should not be going from bad to worse. It's in our and the kid's best interest to both be happy. To appreciate each other, and our history. We\nshould advocate, not defame each other.\nI hope we can break this cycle. This time this summer, you were laughing till you peed your pants. Swapping yummy sides. And heading home with\nlust in our eyes and love in our heart. We gotta do better.\nrobert\nSent:02/02/2024 at 08:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 06:27 AM)\nSubject:Spirit v Tone\nMessage 990 of 4024\nJust remembered that we owe them for two trips.

Should I reach out about today still?\nI didn’t see a list or if after game works\nSent:02/03/2024 at 06:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 06:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg Tip",
