It’s all good. I just can’t tell when you are going to drop off till the next day. That’s all.\nI’m not trying to poke you. I’m just trying to make sure I don’t make the same mistake. I did last night.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 05:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 05:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW\nMessage 978 of 4024\nSo... As I mentioned, I think it’s unfair to have this conversation without setting the context first.\nI have not been able to talk to anyone and have basically been shut out while fear and anxiety has only increased from the cameras to Xfinity and then\nto AT&T. And I am begging not educate you.\nThen yesterday Elsa weighed in with her side of the story, but she has never even heard from me. So I don’t know how she has commentary on my\nside of the story if I’ve never even talked to her.\nNot only that, but I never even got to hear what A.D. even said so I can speak to it. That said it turns out that he saw exactly what I saw, but I’ve not\nhad an opportunity to tell him that and explain.\nThen, of course, nobody knows that’I have apologized to you and acknowledged that the cameras were there. And Indefinitely caught an earful for\nnot saying “I’m sorry” when I already had weeks ago.\nSo as I have me mentioned and offered several times today I would like to show you everything. I would like to do that as soon as possible. Right now,\nwe do not have a full accounting of the story.\nCan you please work with me on at least that part? It will go a long way. And I don’t think it hurts us to tell Dr. Brown that we actually looked at this\nrather than ignored all of the explanation.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 05:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 05:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD",
