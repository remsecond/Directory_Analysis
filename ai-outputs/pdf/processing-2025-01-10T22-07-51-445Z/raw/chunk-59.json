But now I appear to be blocked on both of their phones. I can’t text them or call them. This is obviously giving me some major anxiety. Can you\nlet me know how we can talk quickly about this? It is a major concern for me.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 03:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Whats Going On?\nMessage 962 of 4024\nFalse alarm... I’m not blocked. Thanks!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 03:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Whats Going On?\nMessage 963 of 4024\nThank you for sharing.\nI’d  like to get guidance from Dr. Brown. He’s shared concerns with that I can’t push aside and welcome her perspective how to navigate.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 04:00 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 04:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD\nMessage 964 of 4024\nHe has shared with me as well. See attached. We are having constructive conversations. I want to partner here as if I am actually his father. But I am\nnot allowed.\nIf we can have our conversation please. If you would please make learning what i am talking about a priority, we can speak with one voice again.\nAdrian deserves an explanation for what he saw. I saw the exact same thing- mom in the garage in the app. And I want to show you how/why. Please\nlet me.\nLet’s not put our head in the sand for another week please. There is nothing wrong with me showing the real world experience so you both\nunderstand.\nPlease work with me, Christine.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 04:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD\nAttachments:IMG_1232.PNG (785 KB)",
