  "text": "molestation eventually. As you might do soon. It took years, jail time, and drug the children through hell. And it all never happened. Ot destroyed\ninnocent lives. But apart from sex abuse, we are no different. It’s playing out the exact same way so far.\nAnd please, don’t act like you are not capable of that. It’s insulting to us both with your signature sitting on a legal document with the court and\npolice department alleging that I beat my family. It’s just the other side of the same coin you have already used.\nMessage 1426 of 4024\nConfirmed. Have at me.\nMy point was sometimes we think we remember big things. But we don’t. That seems bigger than just the cams around the house when all was good.\nSince you didn’t, do you think it’s possible you didn’t? Because it might be the case. Or are you so sure you will destroy me and take the boys father\naway.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 03:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 04:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nMessage 1427 of 4024\nThank you for confirming you have deleted the pictures. That is a huge relief for me.\nMy hope is that one day you might recognize my perspective on what unfolded and how I’m just trying to do the right thing by myself and the kids. I\ndidn’t for many years and the harm it caused to me and them, I can’t take back. I own that.\nWe both need peace.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 05:28 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 05:55 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nMessage 1428 of 4024\nAs an FYI-\nSharing two of the live cams you have had in my place since the beach days. You also had one on your desk but not sure what it was used for, but\nknow it acts as the receiver for watching video and listening for audio. I didn't know about them so moved them from Alki to Bellevue thinking they\nwere innocent. I still assume they are, but want to confirm.\nBut both have drop-in enabled. So as we have done so many times in the past, you can just \"drop in\" unannounced and see and hear everything that\ngoes on in the most private spaces of my home, not outside in public view where the expectation of privacy is far different. These were great when we\nneeded them for a quick check in on the kids.\nThen of course, a bunch more (registered to you, again) came over recently that if I plug in, can also monitor audio and video via drop-in. That is\nactually how I found out about the other two that were in my place for who knows how long. I drilled into who they were currently registered to and\nwhat they were capable of.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 05:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 06:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nAttachments:image_123650291__10_.JPG (269 KB)\nimage_123650291__9_.JPG (289 KB)",
