In general, since this all began, it seems tech has not been our friend\nunfortunately.\nI am open to a mutually agreed protocol for urgent or emergency situations. This was not one. But if there is one, we need a better way to\ncommunicate.\nTechnically you can unblock me and we know I won’t use it because of the RO. But if AD has an issue at school (example) I could. What would you\nsuggest?\nSent:02/02/2024 at 08:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 09:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Sync Tonight\nMessage 945 of 4024\nHope you are ok with the investment decisions I’m making. I’ve been very deliberate since July and spend time on this while I am unemployed.\nI trimmed back on losers I wanted to see rebound (ARK, AMD). I was being stubborn. I’m focused on stocks I believe are best for the next 6-12\nmonths.\nThat said, we still have a good chunk of Tesla I’m not comfortable with. It’s not like a real stock. It behaves like a Musk popularity contest. Still tbd\nthere.\nBut loser sales have funded bills and should help offset capital gains we see as we transition to selling some of the winners. I think it’s a win-win\nthough?\nI realize penning this, how I miss our intellectual connection. Between that and booty, we eliminated our most electric/satisfying connections. I\ndigress..\nPlease let me know if you have questions or concerns. I’d be happy to consider input or feedback if you want to consider a more conservative position\nright now.\nIncluding Vanguard as well as fyi..\nSent:02/02/2024 at 09:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 09:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: Support for the Family\nAttachments:IMG_1223.PNG (399 KB)",
