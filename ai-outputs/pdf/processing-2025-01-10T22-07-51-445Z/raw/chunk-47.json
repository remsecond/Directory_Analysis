  "text": "We are putting so much time, energy, and money into this, including the cycles through the attorneys. And that seems to have put a halt on all the\nthings we were trying to wrap up. It has to be worth an hour of our time to be able to put this to bed and put the kids at ease again....\nWe really can solve this before we even start another week!\nMessage 932 of 4024\nLet me know what you think. I'd like to keep this moving and get it to them before the weekend.\nRealistically this does put pressure on you and I, to work out you and I, but I know we can do that.\nbest\nrobert\nSent:02/01/2024 at 08:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:59 AM)\nSubject:SAAS email has been sent for your review\nMessage 933 of 4024\nThis all sounds good. Let me sleep on it as well. Also, since we are trying to clear your headspace, if something is in your way that you really don't\nwant to see, let me know and I'll see if it just makes sense to move it over (I just don't know what those things could be really?). I think we also have a\nplan for Sonos (thanks) and Peloton.\nThe thing that would honestly help me the most, is have you look at my place and think about unused accent pieces that work. That was your jam\nand I know we have some extra (old hallway painting? ) I need stuff to put out, not hide away. But I don't want \"Big & Little together forever\" stuff\nand hope we can just store for now.\nA pretty productive day, Christine. Especially the Teams call where learned to threaten but back off quickly..lol. I hope we maintain now that we\nhave seen what rock bottom looks like. We both want a path to mental health and normalcy... But uou won't send to Anna Lisa if I point out how\nwell we get along when we need to, right ?\nHave a great night. Thanks again for the teamwork...\nSent:02/01/2024 at 08:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items",
