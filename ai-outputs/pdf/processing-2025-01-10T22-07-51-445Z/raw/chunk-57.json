You can still draw your own conclusions in the end.\nBut this lets you see it live, in real time, on the apps and with cams and ask as many questions as you like. You can even drive! I want you to see you’re\nsafe.\nThanks for the thoughtful consideration\nSent:02/02/2024 at 11:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 01:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: As We Discussed\nMessage 957 of 4024\nHey-\nI’m trying to figure out how we do this for Max and even me. The Vyvanse is over 1k name brand w/o insurance and around $450 with. I know that\ncaused a stink before with us.\nBut I know Max just recently had his Rx filled so I am wondering how we did that because the generic has not been available for sometime and it will\nhelp me decide how I do it too.\nAnd side note, I’m hoping that by coming off your Starbucks insurance as you asked, and moving to something else I don’t have a worse plan where I\nhave to pick that cost up.\nLet me know your thoughts. It’s a big number and between Max and I we could be talking about ~1k-2k a month so while it might seem like a\nfrivolous ask, I think it’s important to agree on.\nThanks!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 12:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 01:11 PM)\nSubject:ADHD- Max’s Vyvanse",
