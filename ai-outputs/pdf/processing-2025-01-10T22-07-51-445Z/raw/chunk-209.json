So I’m completely at your mercy. With nothing planned at this point and we had hoped to wrap last\nweek, would you consider just asking what conditions would be appropriate for just some simple face time?\nI hope I add some value to his life.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 01:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 01:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops\nMessage 1457 of 4024\nHey!\nGiven Basketball was canceled, can we touch base real quick at 6:00? No, it is not an emergency. But we have a huge list of things that only got more\nimportant as we ignored them for two weeks. I assure you I will be very civil. We always were for “running list” meetings. We can even do it that way\nif you like.\nI am not going to make this an anxious engagement. I want to reverse course, and know we both want peace and what’s best for the kids. Let’s modify\nDr Brown rules to ask ourselves “is this peaceful and constructive? Is this in the best interest of our children” I believe you can do it, and I know I can\ntoo!\n“A journey of a thousand miles, starts with a single step” let’s please take the solitary step to build on.\nThank You!\n-robert\nSent:02/16/2024 at 02:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 02:12 PM)\nSubject:Touch Base",
