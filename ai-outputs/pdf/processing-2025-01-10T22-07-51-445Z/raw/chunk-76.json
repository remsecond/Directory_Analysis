  "text": "Message 1028 of 4024\nBTW- I am fine when we are trying to go back and forth with line items or answering more than a single question, doing it for that part only in email.\nThis is not designed for that. It’s for short, single subject, tweet length communication. We can keep it super professional and then summarize here.\nPlus an email client will never loose your work!\nSent:02/03/2024 at 07:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\nMessage 1029 of 4024\nIn my mind I was thinking I keep house but guess we address at later date.\nYes got Sonos piece out of closet.\nSocks were straight from closet draw from nice ones to hiking to everyday and not the give to Max.\nThe bags that are in my way are mainly clothes in front room. I had emptied out the closet and dresser drawers so likely workout gear, ski clothes and\nlayers and the other items mentioned below. I’ll put whatever you don’t want sent over in garage so I can rent furniture for front room.\nBox of promo video cassettes.,throw or send?\nSent:02/03/2024 at 08:20 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\nMessage 1030 of 4024\nSo... we definitely discussed. You said that you could make it work. But definitely wanted to move. I offered to see if I could help (when we were on\ngood terms) but you said no. Then I made it clear i planned to try and keep it in the family for the boys sake. It’s all discussed in email. I have never\nheard that you want to change your mind. That’s why I have so much heartburn moving every little thing since I’m coming back.\nFeel free to send socks\nThanks for Sonos\nWhat are “promo videos”\nSounds good on clothes. I want you to have your space. I am hopeful we’ll find peace and civility at some point (this is neither healthy or sustainable\nlong term) and then we can work on garage together and I sort what I keep vs. goodwill.\nSent:02/03/2024 at 08:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys",
