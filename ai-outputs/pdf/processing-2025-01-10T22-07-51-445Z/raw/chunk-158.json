  "text": "I am asking to discuss this with you. Will you please do that. I understand your perspective. I take it very seriously. That is why I went to great last\nnight to explain. May we please discuss rather than you going dark on what you and Dr Brown are doing?\nMessage 1307 of 4024\nCan you please respond?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1308 of 4024\nDr. Brown did not know the issue going into this.\nAfter Adrian shared with her, she asked me if I knew surveillance fell under this category to make sure I was aware. It is alarming and requires the\nappropriate safeguards. I said I did.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1309 of 4024\nHow did she not know? It was in the very first email from you.\nAnd you two did meet, despite her saying otherwise. So she is a liar?\nI am not trying to fight. I just want to find out what is really going on.\nCan we please discuss since there is clearly something going on?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1310 of 4024\nI’m not doing anything with Dr. Brown.\nSimilar to Yurishka, these individuals have a professional obligation to call out when they see harm or DV. They are obligated to Robert.\nPerhaps take a step back a think why all these people are ringing the alarm bell. Is it the entire world or is it you?\nIs everyone else just crazy?\nThis was Adrian’s story.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password",
