  "text": "I want to be helpful and hope after all of this mess on my, you are not using these \"drop-in\" devices for anything nefarious. Or trying to sneak in new\ndigital trojan horses, but you see what I see and have shared. So, they could all be used to spy on me if you want, its just a question of if you are using\nthem. And again- I honestly do not think you are.\nThis was one of the core reasons I tried to open a dialog with you this week. It is in the emails I sent and on the list you asked me to document of\nthings to discuss. I don't believe this is intentional, especially after all we have struggled with in this area. And that's why I wanted it to stay between\nus. I totally give you the benefit of the doubt here.\nSo let me know how would like to proceed given we can't communicate peacefully. I still want to resolve this constructively, but I'm stuck between a\nrock and a hard place if I can't even talk to you about it. And I am NOT making any threats. I am NOT coming after you for cameras in my place. I\nam looking to resolve this and prefer not to go through attorneys.\nCan you let me know your thoughts? If you go dark, I'll assume you are going straight to Anna Lisa instead of working with me. I hope that is not the\ncase for the aforementioned reasons. I honestly believe this is an innocent mistake we can just resolve. I can even talk you through \"unregistering\"\nthem so you can't drop in on me anymore!\nLet's please use common sense and just let me help... This is a super easy fix for us.\nWe can be civil one last time before we burn the bridge behind us. Just let me know!\nMessage 1429 of 4024\nPlease don't go there. That is not fair to me. I would have parted the Red Sea for you and the boys and was fast on the path to self-improvement with\nyour blessing and approval. There is literally nothing in my life I would not have changed for you.\nIf you had got off that plane from Hong Kong and said \"Robert, I am serious as a heart attack. I know it appears that we are doing our best ever, and\nyou may think you are making improvements, but none of it is good enough. Period. I realize now that this is a five-alarm fire. I did not before. So I\nam putting you on notice. You need to listen to my concerns and put something in place that salvages our family after years of destruction.\nOtherwise, I am walking.\"\nAnd if you want to know the truth, Christine, I might still be open to it. Even with all that has happened. I don't want the Moyers to blow up. Or\nleave a man behind. I want to fix it, more than ever. With the knowledge and wisdom of past mistakes so that we can all thrive together.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 06:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 06:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nMessage 1430 of 4024\nI have no words.\nSo those devices were in the house and had capability for what you noted until I sent them to you recently.\nGo after me Robert.\nIt is a threat.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 06:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM",
