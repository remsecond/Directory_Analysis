  "text": "I want to be able to take you at your word and understand when we are working together. Not have the rug pulled out from under me at the last\nminute with no discussion at all (as promised)\nI’m trying to say this in the most peaceful way, consistent with what we agreed to. But it’s very frustrating, Christine. Please don’t teach a bad lesson\nabout trust and patience.\nThis definitely won’t be the road back to any kind of normalcy. Let me know what you think. I am still going to cling to the hope that we can do this.\nPlease exercise some control here.\nThanks\nMessage 1243 of 4024\nI am in control Robert.\nWhat I am slowly learning is to see things for how they really have been, and how what you pushed as normal behavior and how I was treated, your\nactions, was so wildly inappropriate.\nThe continued attempts to manipulate and control me, by shaming me, or stating things as fact when they are grossly untrue, its just shocking.\nThe e-mail about Elsa, and attempts to portray your numerous infidelities as something that I endorsed or condoned....\nSo the correct RO will be filed, and I will not let you to continue to shame, humiliate me, control or manipulate me into doing what you want.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 09:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 09:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Super Frustrated\nMessage 1244 of 4024\nOk, Christine. You lied to me all week.

Go back and read what you wrote. How are things “really” . I did just as you asked me to do to start being a\nhealthy coparent with you. Not manipulate you.\n“Please tell Lisa to send an email to Anna Lisa”\n“I am open to your suggestions, please share”\nBut after I do exactly as you asked, I am a manipulator. I don’t get that. How is that true?\nI thought it was teamwork. I thought I was being helpful. I was doing as I was asked. And I know you won’t read what you wrote. It doesn’t fit your\nSent:02/08/2024 at 10:10 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 07:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Super Frustrated",
