  "text": "Message 833 of 4024\nHi Robert,\nAdrian shared a video you sent him and Max in regards to all devices that you have access to and are connected to via WiFi. It was confusing to me and\nAdrian was very confused as he believes he is still being monitored and is very concerned and anxious.\nCan you provide a list of all devices you are still connected to in the Kirkland residence or have notifications or access to? Per letter from your lawyer\nthe Xfinity’s notifications was the only one that was remaining.\nI understand the Xfinity’s alerts to you should have been stopped and you would provide notification if this was not the case.\nThank you\nChristine\nSent:01/29/2024 at 03:20 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/29/2024 at 03:39 PM)\nSubject:WiFi/connected devices/kids communication\nMessage 834 of 4024\nHi Christine-\nI do not have access to any of those devices. They show in my Alexa account because I bought them at some point over the last >10 years. They just\nget associated with my account as the purchaser.\nThat said we have intentionally connected them in the past of a matter of convenience and automation when we were one big happy family. It made\nsense. But I don’t have any connection with them now.\nI spent some time talking to AD today. Like a lot. Very deep. Really thoughtful. I also discussed the event we shared, and what the video was showing.\nIt would be great to further those conversations ASAP.\nAs for Xfinity, I’m still locked out. We spent quite a bit of time trying to get me in by changing user names and passwords. Still no luck so I cant see\nanything I should. But no new Kirkland alerts I think?\nI’m also not able to make changes to my ATT. Double factor auth goes to your Hotmail. So you’re the gatekeeper. But not sure how to fix unless you\ndo it, but you can’t log in to get that far. Catch-22?\nI’m happy to continue to offer assistance in any way I can but back and forth “gotcha OFW” messages are not going to interest me. Especially with no\ncounsel in town. I just wanted to put you at ease tonight.\nbest\nSent:01/29/2024 at 09:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/29/2024 at 09:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: WiFi/connected devices/kids communication",
