Can we talk!\nDo you have a Valentine’s date?\nSent:02/13/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Chat\nMessage 1362 of 4024\nSo.. you pinged Anna Lisa, Anna Lisa looks like she pinged Lisa, Lisa definitely pinged me and now everyone wants a signature on the same RO that\nwas sent a long while ago.\nObviously, a week back you said: \"Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or\nemails and texts as it is demonstrated they have been ugly, tone is confrontational, scary etc. nothing in recent history demonstrates that will change. I\nam open to your suggestion.\"\nI hope that the offer still stands. AND I hope I have shown a trend toward cooperation and peace, communicating in a way that puts you at ease. My\nsuggested updates to the RO are still valid and will afford us to be much more effective than the current way (which has me re-sending this mail from\nten days back). I hope you can see that.\nSo appreciate the continued partnership here. It is so much nicer than living in a bomb shelter. Just let me know if we are going to follow through on\nthe suggestions you requested of me, and we can ask for an update and be done with this mess!\nHope your day is going well....\nSent:02/13/2024 at 02:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1363 of 4024\nCan you share a list of O/S items?\nI did not see you respond to Dr. Brown for date for your session but maybe I missed it.\nI have a date with the boys and the EY Japan team.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 02:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 02:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Chat",
