  "text": "- Know if even switching this year is an option for us now\n- What a reasonable plan would be if he could not move\n- Want to start something we are not 100% prepared to act on\n- Know if the financial situation is going to be an issue for us\nAnd as an aside, we really need to know what this whole thing means to our future fiscal viability.\nI have always hoped we would be civil and even aligned well enough we could think big picture in terms of the actual execution date of the final\npaperwork so we could \"be divorced\" but if it was going to make a ~100k difference (making up a number) that we would be flexible on the date given\nall the long term implications.  But even saying that given recent history is kicking a bees nest so let's table that. I assume we won't have that luxury. I\ncan dream.\nSo we need to make some assumptions we are not sure will come to pass and come up with a roadmap that assures he can go to SAAS and what it\ntakes to make that happen. The elephant in the room is when I can find work. That helps a lot with our planning. Even if we have no idea what our\nsplit looks like, we know more money and a dependable revenue stream always helps, no matter what. That is not a debate.\nSo, there is another bee's nest. As I am wandering around this place, up since five as usual, trying to sort my life from bags and boxes, as you and I\nnormally are manning our battle stations for the day (again maybe all my fault) I have to be realistic about trying to start an entirely new life (you were\nable to continue your sans me), attend therapy, and be ready for the next crazy, while trying to land a job at Amazon or Google. We know the toll that\ntook on me when you were fully in my corner. So that weighs on my mind as I apply for jobs. And tbh, in my mind there is just no way I can work if\nthings are like they are now (my fault or not) or even land a job.\nSo... without a fight, we need to decide if we have enough confidence in our direction and desired decision to make a Go/No Go call on the bullets\nabove. The reality is we can, we are just at a high risk of getting ourselves into a situation that we cannot sustain. My feeling is we need to have a really\nhonest discussion about what we see as our next steps. SAAS is a little microcosm of our macro picture that could be a forcing function for us. I went\nWAY OFF into the weeds but wanted you to understand my perspective. I want to work. I want to be settled. I want stability. I want to be what I was\nto our family for 25 years without the bad parts.\nBut I am not confident I can do all that in the status quo. But I can assure you my goal is to continue to provide support for my family, monetarily\nand emotionally for - you and the kids. That was my lifelong commitment, no matter what.  But it's not going to be solved in OFW. And I am not\npushing you to go off OFW. I am asking for realistic ideas for how we have a peaceful and planful discussion on SAAS right now along with an\nacknowledgment of the macro factors that I am trying to consider every day. If this in any way has kicked off a fight, please let me withdraw the\nthoughts above and just get back to a SAAS decision this week.\nWhat would you like to do?\nMessage 870 of 4024\nAppreciate the perspective. It’s a lot to digest but feel and appreciate it is hitting all the issues that need to be navigated.\nI’ll need to connect with my lawyer on how best to navigate how we can address these pressing issues.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 08:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 08:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops Friday\nMessage 871 of 4024\nTo overstate the obvious on the elephant noted below...
