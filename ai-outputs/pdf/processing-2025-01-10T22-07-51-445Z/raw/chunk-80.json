  "text": "Message 1044 of 4024\nI’m not comfortable with you coming to the house.\nThe tone in your last few emails is aggressive and is making me feel uncomfortable. The RO is in place for a reason.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 09:39 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 09:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Gift\nMessage 1045 of 4024\nI do not know which lawn chairs are not junk so will leave them for now.\nI will take care of the porn and destroy it. I do not want it in the house.\nWe have mediation to sort the house out.\nThis tone is very aggressive and makes me feel uncomfortable.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 09:43 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 09:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\nMessage 1046 of 4024\nPlease don’t do that. I’m asking to give my son a get well present. I am not trying to be aggressive in the least. We loose a lot in translation. I’m\nsincerely sorry if it came across that way. I will try extra hard!\nSent:02/04/2024 at 09:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 11:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Gift\nMessage 1047 of 4024\nI apologize for the misunderstanding in the written word. It’s unfortunate that is the only way we can communicate because we know historically it’s\nabsolutely the worst way for us to try and get along.\nHow can we move forward today in a constructive way so we get the most stuff done and also cooperate? I do not want to have a fight with you. I am\nlooking for a peaceful and constructive resolution.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 09:45 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 11:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys",
