It sucks but you did a great job here. I think we start with what you are sending. I can only digest so much at a time.\nAlso worried about sending a bunch of stuff that just needs to go back in 8 months. The last conversation we had was me taking over the Kirkland\nmortgage.\nThat said, if it is in your way, of course I want to get it out of your eyesight. But we’re talking about deep into the garage at this point I think. Do you\nagree?\nNothing works for the Sonos unless I have the\ncloset piece.\nNo worries at all about the pillows. That can be whenever.\nWhat did you think about linen and towels? You suggested we refresh.\nI probably need to share other stuff for taxes like my unemployment info.\nHope you are keeping the good extender. I will help when you are ready.\nThey can only move the heater head. No propane. So it needs to be removed.\nAre the socks good or are they the ones we said we would give to Max.\nThe other clothes I’d like to see before we move them. Still ten bags here.\nI would take my backpacks I think. But I owe you luggage back.\nReally appreciate the planning. We will get there!\nSent:02/03/2024 at 07:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys",
