You asked me to just be patient. To wait and you would address. you also said for the court filing just tell Lisa to send Anna Lisa\na note and you would address.\nI think you are telling me none of it is happening. My patience was a waste and you are not doing any of the things that we had discussed all week.\nNot trying to fight, just confirming.\nBTW- you know that forcing us to go through them for every little nit is a conflict of interest right? She stays in the middle of our business. You are\nlike a child with a big piggy bank.\nDon't you ever want to try and get this back on the rails or did she convince you that is the wrong path for the mental health and wellbeing of our\nfamily? It is not normal or healthy.\nThese are not the discussions we have had all week of cooperation, Just go back and look.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 05:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 07:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: RO Communications/Kids",
