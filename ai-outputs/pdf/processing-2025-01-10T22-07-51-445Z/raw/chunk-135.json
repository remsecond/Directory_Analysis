  "text": "Yes update Dr Brown.\nMessage 1221 of 4024\nI’m pretty sure I didnt  agree to cancel Elsa. Was my response like your where you couldn’t see it? . I said she had an important pov. I’m really\nfrustrated and jumping in a call\nI thought urgency was to align before discussion with Elsa. Not cool\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon\nMessage 1222 of 4024\nDr Brown sent.\nPlease let me do the transcript and recommendation. I might have a couple of questions, but you are too busy. I'd like to take that off your plate, so\nyou have at least one less thing to worry about.\nAD was happy to hear the news. And I promised him you and I are working as a team and will put our best foot forward as happy parents. He was\npleased to hear that.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon\nMessage 1223 of 4024\nPlease see this mail from you -> me that includes your comments that I replied to.\nSpecifically, please see your bullet below that is labeled \"Participants.\" From you to me.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns.\nI realize we were discussing the value of Elsa with her limited information and non-participation in this but we were still going back and forth. We set\na time to work on it and you bailed.\nI am happy to repeat my concerns again if I need to, but I offered an alternative plan. And at the end of the day, the Participants list that came FROM\nYOU did not include Elsa. Period.\nSo while we might have been misaligned, I went with what you said. You can say \"not cool\" but I asked repeatedly if we were aligned so this DID\nNOT happen. Blaming me is \"not cool\"\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",
