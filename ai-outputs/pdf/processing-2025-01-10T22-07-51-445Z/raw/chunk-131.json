I don’t want to loose it\nSent:02/08/2024 at 07:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 08:26 AM)\nSubject:Dr Brown\nMessage 1208 of 4024\nI think so. He is in no matter what, right?\nWhen you do, would you mind sharing our thoughts? It would be better to present our teamwork and cooperation rather than coming across as\nuncooperative and uncoordinated.\nAlso, I don’t think the RO applies to you if you ever need me quickly. So just feel free to ring me or text me. I would hate to keep you waiting on an\nanswer from me. Then just block me again afterwords.\nDo you want me to take a!pass at the sass update?  As mentioned I’m not terribly familiar with his ICS experience, but I’ll be happy to take a go at it..\nI think the fine line to walk is being respectful and appreciative, but at the same time, acknowledging the fact that he does not like it and wants to\nquit.\nJust let me know I’m here for you !\nSent:02/08/2024 at 08:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 08:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown",
