  "text": "reasonably timely manner. Thanks again for everything!\nMessage 1506 of 4024\nAre you just too busy? This is pretty important.\nI’m trying to be polite and cooperative. All weekend for that matter after an awful last week. But you knew I had privileges again. So I’m struggling\nwhy you would block this conversation on his last day of winter break.\nI want to give you the benefit of the doubt, but what event on your social calendar today is so incredibly important that you can’t just poke your head\nin on the behalf of Adrian and I after Dr Brown’s approval?\nI really hope it was a hell of a hot date.\nSent:02/19/2024 at 05:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/20/2024 at 05:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1507 of 4024\nPlease accept my apologies. I am sure you are doing your best.

It was an intense session today so pivoting back and focusing is what I did. I was not aware Dr Brown\nwould suggest that.\nApologies accepted.\nThat last comment was inappropriate given what I manage on a day to day basis especially given the intensity of it all.\nIt demonstrates to me you are only able to hold in your comments and behavior until you can’t.\nSent:02/19/2024 at 07:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/19/2024 at 07:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1509 of 4024\nSo apologies not accepted?\nSent:02/19/2024 at 07:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/20/2024 at 05:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown",
