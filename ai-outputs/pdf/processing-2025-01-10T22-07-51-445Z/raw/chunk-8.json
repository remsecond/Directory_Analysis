  "text": "I’m sorry you are taking this approach when I was trying to be helpful. If you would like to drive over right now, I’ll hand you my phone, go in the\nother room and let you try to connect to anything in the house. You will not have any luck.\nThe billing address for my Amazon account is 1210 Kirkland ave. So every device gets set up there by default. So it looks like I have access to things at\nthat address. That is not the case. I’m sharing everything, and trying to explain transparently.\nIf you read my note to the boys, you will see it is just trying to explain the signals we get and how they can be used and interpreted. I’ve tried to tell\nyou many times as well and it is the reason I insisted we separate the ATT and Xfinity accounts.\nIf you would stop using OFW as an assault tool to send to Anna Lisa, and want to work together as Lisa mentioned, I am available, but you just don’t\neven care to learn the basics. If we sit, your phone, my phone we can stop this nonsense in 30 minutes.\nWrt the SoberLink. I found it when i was at the beach. Packed another load, and it was in the boxes again last night. I pee tested today for you so you\ncould see I’m clean on my own. But I thought it was to see the kids which you don’t allow anymore?\nP.S. I just reread my explanation. Why is any of that wrong? It’s spot on. I’ll play the same game with you. It’s all there and real. It’s literally a selling\npoint for each service. They advertise it. Not punish people who use it. I feel like I’m traveling back in time.\nSee attached. I can send as many as you like. They are registered to you. And offline. And given they are 8’ish years old before I even had an Amazon\naccount I guess I should ask you how you made them show up on my app. I’m trying to explain this to you.\ntbh- this is all nuts. It’s beyond nuts. Being an intentional Luddite does not make me a criminal. And the fact that you insisted I beat you and my kids\nrecently and am a threat to do it again in an RO is insane. Every day this is more unhinged.",
