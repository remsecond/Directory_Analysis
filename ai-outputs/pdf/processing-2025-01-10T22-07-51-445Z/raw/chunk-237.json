  "text": "Message 1510 of 4024\nWould you like to discuss what’s next and debrief on Dr Brown? Specifically if the plan is still in accordance with what we sent, as you thought. Or\nhas she just gone ahead with an alternative agenda at this point?\nI don’t care to fight but we double down on what has never worked every week. And now the total blackout on communications means our list is\nstacking higher every day, so love to hear your thoughts on that.\nMost importantly, since everything has gotten really awful since we quit Debbie and ignored Dr Brown, if you are looking into providers as promised.\nWe can say we don’t need it, but history says otherwise.\nJust let me know...\nSent:02/19/2024 at 08:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/20/2024 at 05:52 AM)\nSubject:Next Steps\nMessage 1511 of 4024\nAs I understand next steps, Dr Brown will speak with you Friday then come back with some options for us to consider into the parenting plan.\nWe take that then try finalize something so our layers can make that a legal document.\nLet’s move this forward. I’m hopeful we can align on something we both can agree to.\nI’m meeting Milo and Christina on Saturday to discuss summer schedules. I’ve missed a lot of sign up dates already unfortunately except Camp\nOrkila for Adrian. I’d love to get that squared away soon. Max and Parker are trying to connect for a couple of weeks too.\nSent:02/20/2024 at 05:56 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/20/2024 at 07:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1512 of 4024\nThanks for the update. I’ll need to step away from this for a bit because as I read ...\n- You won’t make an effort outside of this to talk\n- We’re not doing as agreed ‘in writing’ with Dr Brown\n- You “understand” that, and are moving forward\n- I clearly could have helped with ADs summer camps\n- Our ‘list’ efforts will only get worse, but that’s ok\nI don’t want another week like last week. I offered a peaceful solution to work together and was cooperative all weekend. Yet it’s Tuesday and things\nhave only gotten worse with every passing day.\nI really have to step away...\nSent:02/20/2024 at 07:51 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/20/2024 at 09:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps",
