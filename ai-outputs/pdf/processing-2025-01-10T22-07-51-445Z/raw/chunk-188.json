So he does have both his perspective and lived experience and your\nexplanation.\nDr. Brown is trying to help. I’m not sure where you think she is deviating.\nIt appears you are linking her in the Yurishka bucket, where all therapists fall, when they raise alarm bells.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:14 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1390 of 4024\nHow would he know my side? We have never discussed it at all. I have only said I’d like to.\nPlease re-read Dr Brown’s mail. It says exactly what I described below. She called it a grey area that she is going to avoid. That is super easy to\nunderstand.\nI don’t link her to Yurushka. She had an obligation to talk to you. It’s probably an oath they take?\nBut she did not have an obligation to say she did not talk to you, when she did.\nIf this was a police investigation do you really think that would fly? Hell no. She said she did not and did.\nNone of this matters. If I’m wrong, juts copy paste her plan to address the detailed request we made.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:22 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1391 of 4024\nShe is going to talk to us separately to address our plan.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1392 of 4024\nThat is not what she said, Christine. If it is please quote. I don’t want this to devolve. Simply show me.\nThere is no transitive property that because she is talking to us separately, she is doing as we asked.\nShe specifically says she is not. I even pointed it out in my response to her. Let’s not debate. Show me.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 01:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: AAU",
