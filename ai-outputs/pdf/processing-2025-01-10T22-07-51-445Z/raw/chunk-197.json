I don't care to fight.\nFor that matter. Given your reaction this morning, I want to respect your position and don't care to communicate much anymore. You said we both\nwanted peace and explained what it would take to get to normalcy. I tried for almost two weeks, and you were mostly pleasant in OFW for which I\nappreciate. But we got nothing done, no olive branch, and today we only got worse. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy kicking the football. You can\nGoogle it...\nBut you asked about the cams that you sent over with the exact same mounts (one single, one none) you said you never knew existed and if they did,\nyou never knew about them. I won't disagree with you. I just saw you had packed them away and eventually sent them to me. I won't confirm or deny\nyou knew of them. You just handled them. I gave you the ring for xmas. I did not install it. The others were set up but were not reliable or all that\nuseful. We took the white indoor cams down, you put the away, but left the outdoor cams up as a deterrent.\n- Sending a pic of the Amazon purchase before Xmas in 2020. Install date is unknown tbh.\n- Sharing a pic of the outdoor cams, please note how the mounts match the newer ones.\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I am not saying you knew but you asked two questions I'd like to offer my thoughts on.\nOne: \"If we had them, why didn't I have the Blink App installed?\"\nI don't know. If you say you never installed it I believe you. I had it, they did a shitty job so perhaps we stopped using them before you even needed to.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 02:42 PM)\nSubject:Your Questions This AM\nAttachments:Amazon_Screen_Purchases.jpg (261 KB)\nimage_50434817.JPG (1 MB)",
