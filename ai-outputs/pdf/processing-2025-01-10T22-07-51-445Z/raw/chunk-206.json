  "text": "My goal is not to have the chaos in my life that our dynamic has had historically and appears to continue to this day. I am going to minimize that.\nMessage 1444 of 4024\nOk... yesterday you said we would finally move forward and get the help Dr Brown advised we needed. You said you would start that.\nAs I read the below, you seem to be saying that the status quo is fine for you. We just need to accept it. So are you changing that again today?\nDo you realize that you are saying this because you don’t see a change. All while you block every attempt at an olive branch or a change suggestion.\nI’m trusting you to help make a positive change.\nPlease let me know if you are willing to participate.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 09:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 10:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th\nMessage 1445 of 4024\nPlease do let me know on the below...\nBut I want to ask a favor. Since you dictate all communications. And I have no way even to discuss anything of import with you, would you mind\nplease changing one protocol you employ?\nI have alerts. As soon as you send something, you get a reply in one minute. And we can resolve something we are discussing. But you fire at me, and\nthen go back to the foxhole for 3-14 hours.\nJust from a communication efficiency perspective, and maybe even common decency to someone else, can you please consider not doing that? It is\nexactly in contrast to Dr Brown's guidelines.\nEven if you choose to hate me and abandon what you said yesterday (which I sincerely hope you won't, it is exactly what we need most now). I hope\nyou can stop intentional poking me like this.\nHave a great day!\n-robert\nSent:02/16/2024 at 09:58 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 10:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th\nMessage 1446 of 4024\nDid you just do it intentionally again\nafter I politely asked you not to?\nMake it a great day!\nSent:02/16/2024 at 10:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 10:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th",
