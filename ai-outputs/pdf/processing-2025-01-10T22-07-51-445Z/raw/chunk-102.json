Much appreciated. Awesome!!\nI am in a rental for 8 months. So essentially short term storage. The more we move to short term storage with an expiry date in Sept. the worse my life\nbecomes. If I end up in our home or not.\nGiven I might very well be moving back into the house as planned. Let’s hold on clearing everything out. You might end up there as well, but I’d\nprefer we err on the side of the last outcome we discussed.\nThat does not mean we can’t still sell stuff. Or even Swedish clean if you and I can learn to play nicely again. But I have two full rooms of unpacked\nboxes and if Max wants to visit ever has lost his bedroom.\nI am finding more things that can go back, so I’ll wait till we get to critical mass and we can bring them.\nYou gave some Xmas presents back so I assume you don’t want them anymore. Just gadgety stuff.\nVery expensive watches (Mavado) were almost lost. Do I have other valuables that I can look out for? They were with an empty bottle of talcom\npowder I tossed into the can till I heard the “thug” in the trash. Any way to tell the junk from my most expensive possessions?\nThanks again!! We are still going strong, almost a whole day under our belt! Do I see “sell the Porsche” possibilities on the distant horizon?)\nSent:02/05/2024 at 06:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size",
