  "text": "Message 1516 of 4024\nPlease take a moment and read your response. It really makes very little sense. I don’t know if it is just awful grammar or you are calling me a lawyer?\nThe first paragraph is indecipherable. Please clarify.\nAnd I did not note her alarm. I know you two secretly met as you confirmed and she denied, but I was not involved in that. So I have no way of\njudging her reaction to one side of an easy solved riddle.\nI have zero idea what the “eyes wide open” comment means. Is this for our 25 year marriage? Or Is it for the cams that did not exist but were sent to\nme? Or the impossible reconnect that you see the TVs do too?\nYou still did not answer the single most and original question I sent.two days and roughly eight hours ago. I have approval to see Adrian from Dr\nBrown. That was your requirement. So how do I see him now?\nYou also completely skipped the question about doing as Dr Brown had asked us to do and you committed to last week. So we begin to work more\npeacefully and constructively together again.\nAnd as you consider how I downplayed things in my past, do you think you might have downplayed your affair with Kevin? It was worth flat out\nlying about to your husband’s face. Did you downplay that at all?\nAs you reply, may I ask you to save the extra words as I do for you. Also please answer the questions. If this is the only format you will permit, it will\ndo us good if you can show even the most primitive attempt here.\nGiven the “emergency” exception noted, how do I get in touch in that case? You plan to stick to this I see, and say I beat you and my kids (the truth\nwill come out) but I don’t know how to reach you, right?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 05:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 05:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1517 of 4024\nYou meet with Dr. Brown on Friday. She will come back with some proposals for the parenting plan.\nSaturday seems like a good day for you to spend time with Adrian. I could suggest before pictures. I have an event I would like to take him to at 3pm\non Saturday (it was going to be a surprise) but I am open to your suggestions.\nSent:02/21/2024 at 06:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 06:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1518 of 4024\n4th time the charm? are we going to try to get the help we have been prescribed but refuse to follow as our ability to co parent goes deeper into the\nshitter every day? You said you were looking into it since we both wanted peace. Again, are you doing that?\nLet’s discuss Saturday later but thank you for the initial proposal. What’s the surprise if I may ask?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 07:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps",
