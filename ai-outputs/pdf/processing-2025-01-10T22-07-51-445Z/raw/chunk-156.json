  "text": "together in a more cooperative way than this in the future.\nCan you please let me know how it goes since you have shut me out of the process? I have also asked you and Dr Brown if it is at least safe enough to\nsee each other before we meet. I hope we agree there.\nI’d also like to get AD his Nike Tech today. Any chance you can swing by and let him grab it?\nThanks again. Hope this gets better soon!\nMessage 1301 of 4024\nFreaking amazing!!! I have four pairs of jeans now for about total of around ~$45...\nGetting the receipts out and going back to Nordys. I just can’t do the $225 crap.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 02:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spend Today\nMessage 1302 of 4024\nYour Ask:\nRobert (cc'd) and I are aligned that it would be very helpful to engage your assistance in navigating this sensitive area involving surveillance activities\nand monitoring. Robert and I have a different perspective on what unfolded and can share in our discussions. Our lawyers are also aligned with this\nproposed approach on how we might address this issue in relation to the parenting plan. Our proposal would be to schedule a conversation with our\nyoungest son Adrian to share his experience and impact to him, potentially our oldest daughter Elsa, myself and Robert.\nOur Ask:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nway we handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns.\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our\nparenting plan if necessary.\n- How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being\nformally approved. So TBD.\nDr Brown did not seem to do this at all. In any way. Either one of our asks above. I assume this was not a bait and switch, but the intent was clearly to\naddress Adrian's reaction to the cam incident and how we reunify safely and healthily.\nSo now I guess we will never address the cam, how we handled it, and when I can see our son. Given this was your idea, I want to work with you since\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:40 PM)\nSubject:Dr Brown",
