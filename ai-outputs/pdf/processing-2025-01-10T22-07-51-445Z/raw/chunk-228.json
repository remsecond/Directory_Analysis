You and your lawyer said I beat you and the kids. Details matter. You two made that claim\nthat you two can support in court with prior Hillary and witnesses if pressed.\nI’m not in a fighting mood. You said if we wanted to change it just tell Anna Lisa. But then you pulled it back after you talked to her. So there is no\nquestion who came up with the physical violence angle. Let’s not argue.\nLet’s have a nice night!\nSent:02/16/2024 at 07:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me",
