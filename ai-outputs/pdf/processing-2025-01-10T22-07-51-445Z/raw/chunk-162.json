When you need to swap pick up plans. What we are trying to do right now is way bigger, and will have a\npermanent impact on our children’s future and how you and I treat other for a lifetime.\nPlease consider a one time peaceful discussion. I’d be happy to go for a walk, do teams, or phone call. I know we have things we need to work around,\nbut we could do the Bellevue park circle or a place of your choosing. Whatever works.\nBut we are kidding ourselves that this format will do us any justice at all. We know it does not work. Let’s try something that has for us in the past.\nHell. I even sold and bought a house in one day after one of our more contentious walks!\nIn my mind we really are not far apart. Mainly because I’m willing to do whatever you like to feel comfortable. I’m honestly open to ideas and trust\n“most” of your judgement. We have been through the wringer. Let’s compromise.\nLet’s take this back. I showed last week I’m done fighting. Let’s start putting our energy into healthy kids, your job, and my job search. We really don’t\nneed to wake up to ground hog day with every sunrise. I am dying for normalcy.\nYou said you’d consider it. Let’s do it. I know you well enough to believe in you. And I just need a shot to show you who I am now. What we’re doing\nis not working. The kids need healthy parents. Let’s just do it. If we miss failure, we can always do this again.\nYou tell me the time &!place. I’ll have my walking shoes warmed up and bring you cofeve.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 06:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 07:39 PM)\nSubject:Realistic Expectations\nMessage 1324 of 4024\nHe asked if he can come over to watch the Super Bowl tomorrow. He is dying to see the house he chose, furnished. Both the boys are pleasers so he\nwants me to ask you. I think he is concerned about doing something he feels like may disappoint you.\nGiven that he wants it. Dr Brown will not offer an opinion, and there is no harm that will come from it, would you mind asking him like you did for\nthe Alabama game? I trust that you will do it in a way that makes him feel comfortable. I trust you completely.\nGiven zero help from Dr Brown except for her helpful insight for me. That I will take to heart and find healthy moments to explore his concerns, I\nthink we are kind of now at a point where you and I need to decide. And possession is 9/10 of the law.\nSo I’d like to have him over. The alternative is pick some random date in the next few weeks when nothing has changed. It will be like all of last month\nall over again for us. Or we wait weeks/months to try and do something big and formal like for Max.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 07:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 07:38 PM)\nSubject:Adrian",
