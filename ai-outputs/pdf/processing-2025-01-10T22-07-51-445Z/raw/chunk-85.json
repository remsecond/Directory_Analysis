Thanks for all the effort to make this possible.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 01:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move\nMessage 1064 of 4024\nI have no idea what you are referring to. I saw a barrage of messages earlier and told you I’d come back to it as I was navigating xfinity then sat at att\nstore since 11.\nThis is uncalled for. I can’t do this back and forth with you. There has to be a better way.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 01:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 01:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1065 of 4024\nHe said he was flexible. What window works for you and I’ll work around meeting schedule and wfh\nSent:02/04/2024 at 01:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 01:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move\nMessage 1066 of 4024\nThe better way is exactly what I suggested.\nWhere did you say that after the messages earlier? They were sent at 9:30 and you checked out. You mentioned ATT three hours later, making my\npoint.\nI don’t want to fight. I told you exactly what the issue is and how we could work better together. And you are saying you knowledges me and would\ncome back.\nBut you did not. That is all I was asking for.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 01:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 02:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1067 of 4024\nWhat works best? Kirkland 1:00 start? 2:00? Did you get an idea on truck size?\nSent:02/04/2024 at 01:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 02:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move",
