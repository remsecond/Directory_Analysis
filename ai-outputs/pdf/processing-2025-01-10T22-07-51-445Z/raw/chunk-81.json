  "text": "Message 1048 of 4024\nI understand you felt like my tone was aggressive. I have apologize for that. I don’t think the written word does us any justice. It never has and it never\nwill. It’s unfortunate that that is all we have.\nYou did let me know that you had a change of plans to something that was very significant in our lives. I would like to understand that better. If you’\nre not ready to talk about that, then I will Acquiesce and we can talk about it at another date.\nBut I don’t want to have another bad day with you. Let’s please work constructively to resolve our problems. We have a lot of stuff on our plate and\nit’s Sunday so we can start planning and making progress.\nPlease respond to this so I know that you have seen it. It gets very frustrating in this mode of communication when I have to wait around hours for\nhours and I really don’t know what we’re trying to do.  Thanks!\nSent:02/04/2024 at 09:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 11:08 AM)\nSubject:Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1049 of 4024\nI am not trying to be aggressive.\nSo we can work better together can we establish some mutual expectations for tasks we are working together on?\nYou send questions. Know I get alerts and will respond. Then check out. So you are well aware of what you’re doing.\nDr. Brown was very clear on her suggestion about how we can have more peaceful communications. To make OFW work, her suggestion was to talk\nto each other like you were speaking to your boss afraid of losing yourjob.\nSo trying let’s imagine you and Julie were working on a problem together in real time that meant a physical time commitment from you both today.\nYou send some q’s and step away for a few hours not telling her you checked out.\nAgain not being aggressive, but what would she think? How am I supposed to respond? I’m guess my feedback is you are complaining about me\nbeing aggressive, then doing the most passive aggressive thing ever.\nI am asking to work with you on time sensitive planning that requires a physical commitment today. Can we please be more respectful of each other?\nSent:02/04/2024 at 10:10 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 11:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1050 of 4024\nBack to this:\n- Do you need Pyrex? I have too much.\n- I think you have enough TV remotes but I have more\nSent:02/04/2024 at 11:03 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 11:09 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Gift",
