  "text": "Message 912 of 4024\nGreat email. Thanks. My questions are...\n- if we say there is a difference of opinion, we need to kick off the discussion. She can’t go into this blind. Your proposal only speaks to scheduling\nAD.\n- we spent considerable time discussing the Elsa thread this AM and how we arrived at our status quo. You offered to include that. I don’t see it.\nHow do you feel like we should address?\nReally appreciate it, Christine!\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 10:46 AM)\nSubject:Dr Brown\nMessage 913 of 4024\nFeel free to follow up.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:46 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 914 of 4024\nThat will give the appearance I am arguing and only thinking of myself. I have been there, done that. I can’t do that. You sent the mail.\nIf I come over the top of you, correcting oversights it is not a fair reflection of the situation. May you please address as we had discussed originally?\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 915 of 4024\nActually I included scheduling a discussion with you, Elsa and I in the email.\nLet’s wait for her to come back as my original thinking was by requesting above it would cover what we are trying to achieve on both your points. Y is\ngoing to share her perspective on what happened\nSent:02/01/2024 at 12:15 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown",
