Can we at least do a five-minute teams call to even discuss what’s next to even get to the running list discussion?\nOf course we can talk Dr Brown too as that is most pressing but we also have SAAS, which we seem to be dead in the water on after the call to\nurgency yesterday.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 10:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 910 of 4024\nI’m in back to back meetings through this afternoon and need to align with lawyer so I do not cause violation of RO. I don’t intend to be blamed for\nthat.\nJust sent email to Dr. Brown.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 10:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 911 of 4024\nSo... there will be zero blame. I am asking for it in the best interest of our kids. And I am documenting it here as not something that is to blame you\nfor. Plus, it’s not in the RO.\nI am happy to wait till the afternoon. Just let me know what time works and I will work around you.\nThanks for kicking off Dr Brown.\nI see there are other threads on move stuff too. I’ll try and keep up with everything and try to organize our discussion by sending the agenda ahead of\ntime.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 10:34 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 10:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
