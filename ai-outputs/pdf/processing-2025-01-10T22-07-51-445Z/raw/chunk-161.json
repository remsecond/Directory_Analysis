Actually, not at all. But I want to respect that. I am really trying to work with you here.\nI don’t understand what is not working with regard to our parenting plan. We just had an agreement to go discuss something today and she went\nwildly off scope it sounds like..\nI think that is OK I am just disappointed that she’s not being honest about it . And I get your perspective totally. But it does not change the fact that I\nwant to work with you and understand how I can be a good dad.\nBut I will step back. I hope we can touch base later tonight. Thank you for the thoughtful consideration.\nPlease tell Max I am still working on this. But it is very difficult.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1320 of 4024\nI think you know what I’m gonna say...\nI’ll keep telling you whenever I get them OK?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1330.PNG (5 MB)\nMessage 1321 of 4024\nTell him to try V1\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:42 PM)\nSubject:Really Password...",
