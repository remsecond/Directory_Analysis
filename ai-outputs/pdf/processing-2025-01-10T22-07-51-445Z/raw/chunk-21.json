  "text": "plan which I am going to request.\"\nI'm super bummed our kids think there is spying going on and I'm not sure they are getting the most accurate answers to their concerns. So I hope\nyou can help. To close on the phone and text messaging comments, I want to clarify the history of call/text reporting, the nature of these reports, and\nour mutual access to them as account holders. And when I was thinking about it, I realized they have likely never even seen a paper phone bill.\nI hope you will tell them that the activity described, which includes calls and texts, has long been a standard practice by phone companies that began\nin the 1980s for long-distance calls. Which were expensive. The purpose was to ensure billing accuracy and transparency to customers so they could\nmanage phone usage. This used to terrify me when I would sneak down River Oaks Parkway every night to secretly call you in Hong Kong.\nSo as account holders, we both have always had access to this information. It is our family plan after all. I even think we used to get a paper bill\nourselves. But it's not a form of surveillance by me or you. It's a standard feature by ATT for accountability, fraud detection, and accurate record-\nkeeping. And your status as an account holder inherently includes consent to reporting your data back to you as a part of the service agreement, we\nhave.\nI get without context and having never seen the fat white and blue envelopes with tens of lines of numbers inside, they don't have history. They don't\nrealize that roommates or families would grab a highlighter and take turns finding their boy or girlfriend's phone number and say which calls were\ntheirs. Then pull out the calculator to total everyone's share of the bill, just like we did with restaurant tabs when we would split up a big dinner bill.\nThey should know that our intention was never to monitor or surveil their phone usage. The logs on our bill for phone and text records is just a\nroutine aspect of our phone service. It has gone on for decades now for good reason. It started with paper fifty years ago and has since largely moved\nto an online bill where it's possible to filter, sort, pivot, and categorize history just like you can do with any online date. But it's not spying now or\nthen.\nI hope since you have their ear, and I can't teach them like I used to do, you will explain so they understand. It's just good parenting, and I trust you\nwill convey the message and ease their unfounded fears. I think we all grew up knowing that every number we dialed would show on the bill so we\nsure as hell better not spend all night on the phone with our future wife in Asia. It's just funny how we lost that history and the tribal knowledge\nsince.\nThanks!\nMessage 850 of 4024\nIs due Feb 7 in amount of 7,612 to cover Max’s ongoing school enrollment,\nWith a balance of 6.7k in BofA currently which is  insufficient funds to cover tuition in BofA plus ongoing expenses.\nThe 40k transferred was to cover my Amex card for 13k plus Chase/Amazon account for 28k.\nWhen I looked you had paid off your Amex for 9.5k (I had no visibility balance) and your lawyer bill of 3.6k  which was not factored into the 40k. We\nalso had to pay deposit of 3.6k for SAAS reenrollment which was shared.\nGiven that, I had only paid off 20k of chase so there remains 8k balance before new charges and I haven’t paid Alaska card of 2.5k.\nLet me know when funds will be transferred.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 04:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 04:46 PM)\nSubject:SAAS tuition payment",
