I highly doubt that we would be in this state if we had listened to her advice.\nI am all in. Perhaps we even use the plan you have laid out near term and then take her advice and see if it helps us be civil again.\nIf we really believe in her, can we really believe in her? It can't get any worse.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 01:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 01:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 823 of 4024\nCircling back... so many issues in this thread. In the past, I think I would be fighting and striking back.\nI think the first biggie is if you wanted to include the part in the RO that says I have and am likely to beat you and the kids again. Paraphrasing of\ncourse.\nThe second biggie was the Dr Brown proposal. I do not understand how we hope she can heal us or what the plan is. I'd love to try and work with\nyou.\nI am not in a fighting mood. I accept m responsibility for this and our entire marriage. I have apologized for everything that I have done.\nI would just like to know how/if we can work together for the benefit of the Moyers. So, I'll take the drive by fire. But hope we can do more.\nJust let me know... I'm all ears and ready and willing, Christine.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 02:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 02:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>",
