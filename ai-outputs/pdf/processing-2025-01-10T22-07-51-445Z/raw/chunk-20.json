Our family really needs it now.\nrobert\nMessage 846 of 4024\nSee your text to them. If it misled them that’s on you in regards to your communication.\nPutting blame on me is unbelievable given the nefarious monitoring cameras you put up without my knowledge. No one believes your explanation\nand if you insist we can test it out.\nI still need log in credentials to the blink account I have never had knowledge of or access to. Deleting an app does not delete an account.\nFor employment, if you are saying you are no longer employable because of the RO, that’s your position and we will prepare our side accordingly.\nThe RO was a result of your direct actions. You are not the victim here but us. If you disagreed then you and lawyer should not have signed it. I\ncertainly did not agree to one.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 08:27 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Stop the Forked Threads\nMessage 847 of 4024\nPer below you will not be employed because of the RO.\nSo I should not expect any contribution from you in form of salary but clearly there are other ways to have you contribute.\nAre you saying the decision for moving forward with SAAS is up to me? If this is your position that I will make a decision and inform you\naccordingly.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 08:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS/Adrian\nMessage 848 of 4024\nIf it was an outright lie as you purport it says, why did you sign it? Your choice.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 08:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS/Adrian\nMessage 849 of 4024\n\"The text message to the boys was very clear that everything they do is being tracked and you can see everything.
