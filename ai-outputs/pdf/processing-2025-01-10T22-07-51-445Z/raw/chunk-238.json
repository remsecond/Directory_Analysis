Please advise.\nRobert Moyer on Feb 19, 2024, 1:58 PM\nElapsed Time: 2 days and 10 hours\n- Question: Now that I have approved Adrian visits, can we chat? OFW is going to take weeks.\nRobert Moyer on Sent Feb 19, 2024, 8:59 PM\nElapsed Time: 2 days and 3 hours\n- Question: Is Dr Brown pursuing our mutual ask or an alternative agenda?\n- Question: Do you plan to accommodate a running list format or just this?\n- Question: Are you still pursuing the communication counselor as promised?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 03:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1514 of 4024\n.\nSent:02/21/2024 at 04:10 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_1516.PNG (7 MB)\nMessage 1515 of 4024\nYour last message was you are going to step away so I respected that.\nI don’t believe I owe you a status update on my communication counselor, just like I don’t ask you. We will both need to demonstrate that we have\ncompleted, if that’s what we put into the parenting plan.\nDr Brown I believe is following our ask. If you noted her alarmed at what transpired, my personal\nOpinion is that’s it’s justified. You have a different lens on your actions and what they are labeled as, and impact. I don’t think you and I have come\nacross anyone that minimizes your actions from your lens, rather they raise alarm bells. My eyes are wide open now to what was happening and how\nthey are characterized despite your efforts to downplay.\nYes unless it’s an emergency, I intend to use this forum for running list.\nSent:02/21/2024 at 05:19 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 05:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps",
