I wish I could have shown you everything the moment I\nrealized this was happening when I cam over the next day. But we are where we are.\nMaybe someday we come to terms with all this, but I'm not hopeful anymore. No dialog or shared exchange of perspectives will only entrench and\nincrease the hate for one another.\nMessage 1424 of 4024\nI appreciate you responding to my questions below with that level of detail.\nOne thing that really jumped out for me, and now I am terrified of, given the volatility of the situation, and past threats, is mention of explicit pictures\nwith my face on them.\nI am going to ask you destroy those. Please confirm once that is done.\nWhen reading the different forms and options, pics, videos and other images of a sexual nature, that could be used as a weapon, could be ordered\ndeleted.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 02:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 02:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nMessage 1425 of 4024\nSo... I wanted to let you know after I sent this.\nI destroyed all the face, tattoo pics and couple of years ago. You were my wife. I had the real thing whenever I wanted. And I wanted to protect you.\nHacking happens (juts like the last few days) I would never let my Queen be tarnished.They have been long gone.\nI will also delete the anonymous ones. I have not looked at them in two years.I have no issues with that. I do want the undie ones that don’t show\nanything more than your amazing body and what anyone would see at the beach. Let me know if that is an issue. I’d like those maybe?\nWhat forms and options are you reading about how to come after me if I may ask? I’m not doing any of that. I’m trying to focus on improving us but\nyou won’t I guess maybe I should stop and light a fire with Lisa. Tell her we need to stop playing nice and start preparing for a frontal assault because\nmy efforts to heal wounds and co-parent are in vain.\nMy hope was we could work this out and move on with grace and respect, but not a single hope has materialized. You say I have, and will beat my kids\nagain. Realistically I assume you might say anything. Perhaps sexual molestation is next. It would be just as true as me beating them and pack an even\nmore lethal punch for ya.\nI have zero desire to cause you harm. I have shown that. I never surveilled you but you won’t even consider if what I have said could even possibly be\ntrue. And it definitely can and I can show you. But you refuse to even watch a real life demonstration. You seem dead set on not even considering an\nalternative explanation for the cams or the physical abuse claims you levied against me.\nIn your heart. Like really deep down below all the hate and willful destruction you have for me, you know, the kids know, the world knows I never\nbeat you or my kids. To sign your name on a legal document saying that is nuts. Yet that is what you have alleged to god and everyone, including the\ncourts and police. You don’t think that perhaps, at this point you and Anna Lisa have taken my persecution too far yet?\nI watched a show the other day about a wife who alleged the same thing on her husband for custody like you are doing now. She moved to sexual\nSent:02/15/2024 at 03:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM",
