  "text": "devolved into acrimony and contempt.\nI know what’s in it for Anna Lisa, but you’re the mother of our family. And despite how this is positioning your mediation strategy, imho, we are\ndoing life long damage to the kids and frankly you.\nI anticipate a response that it’s all my fault. That’s fine. It is. Our entire marriage was my fault, the kids are my fault, and we never had a nice day in 29\nwasted years. But I still want to unwind our disaster peacefully.\nSo.... I’m asking in a hopeful way in the spirt of healthy co-parents, how we communicate moving forward. The prescribed method isn’t  working and\ngets worse every day as asks go ignored.\nThanks!\n- robert\nMessage 1332 of 4024\nThank you for the kind note.\nYes I agree there are items we should circle back on.\nYour list probably covers all my items but please feel free to kick off.\nHope your day has started well too Robert.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 11:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 11:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1333 of 4024\nThank you for the prompt and kind reply.\nI can start list and share beforehand. My concern is for some of these things we could spend 20 minutes talking to reach an agreement or a week going\nback and forth here. For each of ~five issues?\nIt’s not meant to be a criticism but a simple acknowledgement that when four hours pass before you can afford a reply, an exchange that should take\n5-10 minutes usually takes more than 5-10 hours.\nMy hope is we can:\n- Start with a list here (OFW)\n- Both share our thoughts (email?)\n- Agree to discuss peacefully (tbd?)\n- Peacefully agree/disagree\n- Document our decisions (OFW)\n- Expedite our existing backlog\nIf we can agree, I will start the list today. We can swap our first thoughts (it would be far easier in email for inline comments?). And then have our 1-1\nmeeting together on Wednesday evening.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 12:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 12:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
