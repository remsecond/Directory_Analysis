  "text": "Message 838 of 4024\nI have some legacy address settings that still get applied to some items. Would you mind bringing mail and packages to Adrian’s practices till these are\nworked out of the system?\nBTW- I am still stumped on how to explain the standard services and gadgets we have in a way that you and the boys will understand. It feels like you\nall have so limited knowledge it’s a non-starter.\nI wonder if there is an immediate solution to host a safe discussion. Perhaps with Elsa, Milo, Katherine there. Someone who knows tech at least the\nbasics. Because we are just spinning right now.\nOr would you like me to search out YouTube videos, author a deck? You guys are just so so far off wrt to understanding even the most basic things we\ncan’t have a productive discussion. It’s frustrating.\nCan you imagine trying to explain accounting to someone who doesn’t known what numbers are? To them, they are just symbols, or little squiggly\npictures on a page. That’s literally where we are now.\nSending this to Anna Lisa in the end is not helpful. If\nyou have a question or concern we have to address it. It’s all very straightforward and easy if you take the time. Can we find a safe space for that\nconversation?\nSent:01/30/2024 at 06:20 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 06:55 AM)\nSubject:Friday Practice\nMessage 839 of 4024\nForgot the attachment...\nSent:01/30/2024 at 06:26 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 06:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: Friday Practice\nAttachments:IMG_1194.PNG (208 KB)\nMessage 840 of 4024\nI would like to get a lugg set up to move the remaining items to your place or I can move them to a storage unit. Let me know your preference.\nThe text message to the boys was very clear that everything they do is being tracked and you can see everything. They asked to be moved off your cell\nplan which I am going to request.\nSee ending sentence “we can play a fun game where you describe how could you know if I cuz and I’ll tell ya.”\nThe paragraph about every call text when you leave and come home etc\nIf you can’t do that now why tell them  you can?\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:01 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 07:09 AM)\nSubject:Re: Friday Practice",
