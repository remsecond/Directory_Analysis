I could have been more helpful but did not want to ruin a positive conversation with you.\nNow that you have taken the reigns of the Network, however, you see all the stuff I used to see.  It is not intentional, you don't always understand it,\nbut unwelcome alerts pop up on your phone. I know, it happened to me all the freaking time.\nThe good news is that Samsung is likely a TV that was out of Wi-Fi range and conditions changed (a door that is usually closed is left open) or it has\nnot been turned on in a long while (maybe the TV in the man cave?). Then it reconnects, then you get an alert.\nThe good news is to join the network, it had to have a password at some point. And maybe this was just a TV that has not been joined since you\nchanged the WiFI name? That can happen. So it's annoying for sure, but probably safe, and not nefarious.\nSo as mentioned, if you let me know next time, I can teach you how to open an alert, investigate what it is, and have some peace of mind that it should\nbe there. Some android devices are no help, but Samsung usually has the metadata you need.\nAlternatively, perhaps I can screen record simulating the same situation on my phone and share it with you. A picture is worth a thousand words, so a\nvideo is probably worth a book. Divorce is the worst time to have this kind of alert crap happening.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 10:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1358 of 4024\nWe are waiting on Anna Lisa. That is fine. And I am waiting to formalize my list, so I will run some errands while we wait. BTW- Fernish does NOT\ndeliver to Kirkland or Bellevue. So I am buying a real cheap kitchen table from World Market ($650).\nSo I would like to propose something that keeps us on track, but more importantly, could yield unlimited potential for how we work together in the\nfuture. Our chat should not be time-boxed and should be in a comfortable and relaxing setting.\nSo, to kill so many birds with one stone. I am proposing you allow me to make you dinner here tomorrow night and start something new. I know\nyou'll say you are not comfortable. I am asking to please step out of your comfort zone for a couple of hours.\nI will make you the most delicious Filet Mignon you have ever tasted, fresh steamed rice, and broccoli. Then serve it all with hot buttered French\nSent:02/13/2024 at 10:51 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Our Chat",
