  "text": "none of our intentions were met. What do you suggest next. This is all so beyond fucked to me.\nBut it does make it clear why Elsa was going to be involved. There was never any intention to do what we had asked her to do. I know I had issues. I\nknow they need to be addressed. But I can't do that if I can't address them. What would you like?\nThis is absolutely not the engagement described, requested, or signed up for.\nMessage 1303 of 4024\nAdrian shared what he witnessed with Dr. Brown, impact and as I understand what he feels needs to happen to earn trust etc.\nShe is scheduling time with you and I separately but indicated that surveillance activities are highly concerning and meet the threshold for DV.\nI know you are contesting the surveillance but understanding consequences and long term impact are something I am uncertain you have fully\ncomprehended.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1304 of 4024\nMax is trying to access the Xbox account which uses the robmoyer_ms@hotmail.com account.\nThe password it has traditionally been does not work.\nHe is asking if you can please share it.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:51 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Password\nMessage 1305 of 4024\nWait... I did not think you two met? That’s what she said. And if it did happen, I agree. But did you two meet and discuss this and she lied?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1306 of 4024\nIt’s always V1.\nI don’t hide anything from you guys. He can call if it’s a problem.\nHow can we sync on Dr Brown before you go dark? You clearly are privy to details I am not.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password",
