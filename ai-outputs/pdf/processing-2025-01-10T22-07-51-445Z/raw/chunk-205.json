Just go back into our bunker and lob bombs?\nI spent two weeks hearing:\n“thank you for the thoughtful effort”\n“I appreciate the positive tone today”\n“If patient I’ll come back this afternoon”\n.... Crickets...\nBut I’m sure you were doing the best you could. I realize this is hard for you. But we are never going to agree on perspectives so the question is do we\naccept that, learn how to be nice given that, and try to be kind and constructive.\nI’d like a dialog, but I’d like some commitment and follow. I hope that is reasonable. I really just wish we were not set up to hate each other for profit\nby others since August. But we are where we are. Hope they enjoy the new hot-tub.\nWhat would you like to do? This is not working and saying that every day seems dumb to both of us.\nI’m all in if you would like to try, Christine.\nHave a great day and enjoy the sunshine!\n- robert\nSent:02/16/2024 at 09:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 09:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th\nMessage 1443 of 4024\nI know we both want to move this forward so we can both focus on positive aspects and rebuild our lives to be happy.\nThe divorce is happening.\nWe need a parenting plan, either with assistance with Dr Brown, engage a parent evaluator, hash out in mediation, have judge decide.\nAlign on child support\nAlign on spousal support\nAlign on division of assets\nSet a mediation date.\nWe both need to accept realities of where you and I are now in communications and what we can expect or not from the other.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 09:22 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 09:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th",
