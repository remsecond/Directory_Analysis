  "text": "Side Note- Thinking about the day ahead a bit. I'll be doing the apartment and will send an update. We have a bunch of other threads on you name it.\nYou have your mandatory workday.\nI meant what I said last night. If you want to light up a topic, I'll respond of course (kindly as noted) but it's been a tough stretch. I am happy to put\nanything on ice for a day (or two).\nPerhaps we get a more cordial running list together in a constructive way in our own quiet moments and share later without the back and forth.\nOtherwise, It's going to take a toll on us.\nI'll save my superfluous words. You do you. I'll do me, and try and try to make the best decisions without bugging you. I am here for you if you need\nme, but otherwise don't sweat me.\nMaybe a simple Ack or thumbs up on this would make me feel better, but your call.\nHave a great and productive day, Christine.\nMessage 868 of 4024\nThank you for the cordial note\nI am ready to move to a phase with less acrimony. It is taking its toll on everyone.\nAdrian, I am concerned about his mental state and believe his current school situation is contributing greatly to it.\nThat said, I am uncertain what to do about SAAS given I need your alignment on any attempt to move and how we address the cost.\nWe can address in separate email when you are ready.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 06:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops Friday\nMessage 869 of 4024\nThanks for the ack.\nwrt AD, I’m super concerned all up. I’ll own my contribution to that and want to see how I can start making that right in a healthy way ASAP. That\nis a longer discussion but wanted to acknowledge my impact.\nwrt SAAS, even if it's a no, we need to agree on a plan that we can share with him ASAP. He needs that settled in his brain no matter what the answer\nis. The uncertainty as a child this age is not fair to him and we owe him better.\nMy thought is that we need to figure out how to make it work. The only question is this year or next.\nWe don't:\n- Want him to go through admissions if we don't have to\nSent:01/31/2024 at 07:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops Friday",
