I agree. Nothing you can do for a virus. What are his symptoms and which ones are getting better, persisting, or getting more acute. Does he\nhave a fever at all? Is his cough getting better or worse. Children’s Tylenol and Day/Night quill will help with comfort and sleep. Just my two cents.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 07:49 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!\nMessage 1089 of 4024\nThroat hurts, breathe is sharp pain, head ache, body chills.\nHe has been eating and drinking so great sign.\nYesterday I heard him on phone with friends playing video games but very weak.\nI honestly think he needs to just rest and key it pass.\nI’ll give him some pain reliever.\nIn regards to the move I’ll prioritize front room that would help my mental state greatly. I sounds like you won’t have space to store many of items. As\nmuch came from dresser drawers perhaps i load up dresser too and you put in the room that has laundry that you said was huge? That way you won’t\nbe looking at garbage bags for clothes you use infrequently. Just a suggestion.\nElsa i am sure will be willing to help sort out. Just get her in the books.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 07:53 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!\nMessage 1090 of 4024\nFor throat relief use Chloraseptic spray and lozenges.\nTylenol is for pain and chills, it will ease the pain and severity.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!",
