I am their dad, and I’m always there for them.\nSo with that, I assume there is no longer a need for a parenting plan. If I’m fighting so hard to see them but they don’t want to see me, it doesn’t make\nany sense. I can’t force them to love me, so I’m going to stop.\nI assume that will end 90% of our fights and give you what you want (and actually have already taken) I hope I did that in a healthy way. Everything\nchanged when you said AD doesn’t want to be with me.\nPlease let me know if you need anything and same as for the boys, I’ll be there for you. I understand why you all hate me now, so I’ll stop being your\nburden. You are all free. No more Dad!

Just wanted to touch base given a long list of things (mostly kid related\ntopics) that I would like to touch base on with you.\nI shared several related emails over the weekend that went unanswered. You might be too busy or are just choosing not to reply. That is honestly none\nof my business. But I did comply with the OFW ask.\nSo, in the spirt of healthy cooperation I’ll send one more to see if you would like to - continue using OFW despite it not working, arrange for a way to\npeacefully communicate, or move to expensive lawyers.\nI am trying hard to recognize your concerns and anticipate a response of “it’s too much to even reply”. But I am using OFW as asked, and when you\ndon’t reply, I agree. It’s a lot, now we are backed up.\nI’m also disappointed that we keep adopting the guidelines you and Anna Lisa dictate, and since October our relationship and co-parenting has\nSent:02/12/2024 at 11:42 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 11:55 AM)\nSubject:Touch Base",
