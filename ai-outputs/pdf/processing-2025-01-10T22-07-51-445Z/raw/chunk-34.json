I called to be sure that she knew phone numbers showed up on our bill but it exploded into how I\nruined her life. I may not agree with some of her characterizations, but that does not matter. It is her perspective. Her perception that it was me alone\ntrying to figure out what was going on in High School was surprising but understandable.\nShe told me she saw the cameras in September and thought you had put them up. I wish we had the discussion then. But it was a small point to what\nshe opened my eyes to. And it is consistent with the talk track you have played to me. That in my alcoholic years, you felt a need to acquiesce to me.\nYou were just trying to keep the peace and not rock the boat. I needed to hear that.\nI understood then as she snuck boys into her room, sent underage porn on her phone, vomited vodka over both sides of the truck (she had been\ndriving), lost a six-figure full ride to college shoplifting for a boy, and made LBGTQ offensive online posts, what we were doing to get her back on the\nrails was mutually agree to. we both were trying to sus things out together.\nBut her perspective is that it was all me and has always been all me. And now this incident is just a continuation of that behavior. It is important to me\nthat I know now that I am seen as the villain in this family. That we were not the team I thought we were. And at least in her mind (and maybe yours)\nI was doing all these things to be nefarious and ruin her life. I need to think on that.\nBut most important is the insight into where I think you are coming from. I thought as we were raising our kids we were aligned. But you are washing\nyour hands clean of that. That this was all me and you had nothing to do with it. It is a history that does not match mine. But I was an active alcoholic\nso maybe I was missing things that you were telling me or misinterpreting things.\nEither way, it was a deep and insightful lens into the narrative you and the kids have. And at this point in my life, it helps explain a lot. I believe\nmarriage takes two, but if the perspective is it was all me as some despotic ruler, I want to acknowledge that and do some soul-searching on how this\ncame to pass. How I thought we were making parenting decisions together but were not.\nIt has been said that \"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”\nMaybe I'm that asshole...\nSent:02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM)\nSubject:Elsa",
