Dr Brown is not shy about\nvoicing her concerns. And she clearly did not. Thanks!\nSent:02/16/2024 at 12:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 12:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops\nMessage 1453 of 4024\nI’d like to align with next steps in discussions with Dr Brown.\nIn any case his arm is still healing.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 12:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 12:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops\nMessage 1454 of 4024\nAll good.
