  "text": "we were able to accomplish. We did incredible things that less than a percent of Americans can do. We soared together (obviously at too high a cost)\nSo while I might be able to do better without you, as a unit of \"resource-generating horsepower'', what we did together, as a team, was generational.\nI honestly don't believe solo, I can do better without your contributions. You were our backbone, while I was the muscle. Muscles don't work\nwithout strong bones to anchor them. We both need to be realistic about what an amazing and irreplaceable role you played in what we were able to\ndo together. So, as we discuss \"getting a job\", it is easy to say. But this muscle no longer has the backbone that made it a success. You were at least 50%\nof the equation.\nEverything will be different without you.\nMessage 872 of 4024\nI appreciate your acknowledgment of my contribution. Thank you.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 10:48 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 10:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops Friday\nMessage 873 of 4024\nI just had to diary my thoughts to you of grace and thanks. No more hard feelings. But it's in a draft email that I can't send to share my gratitude.\nAnd I am realizing we don't have any way to say thank you anymore. No facility for kindness or appreciation of one another. We are locked out.\nIf I promise to keep it brief, can you ask your attorney how I can say \"thank you\" for all you have done for me? I owe so much to you in my life.\nBut to play by the rules... it would also be good for the kids, I think, if I'm allowed to tell you how much I appreciate and want to work with you.\n\nHopefully, the inspection will start soon. It's supposed to be at 1:00. Hope you are well...\nSent:01/31/2024 at 12:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 02:17 PM)\nSubject:Gratitude...\nMessage 874 of 4024\nKicked off a 10k transfer last night\nSent:01/31/2024 at 01:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 02:18 PM)\nSubject:Tuition\nMessage 875 of 4024\nCan I ask a question?
