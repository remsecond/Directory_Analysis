Even the stuff we are doing on email now is not allowed.\nSomeone always has to be on the mail for you and I to swap them. So we can’t just share basic information about our own kids.\nAnd honestly, it would be better if we could have a running list format. We can start with something very small but effective.\nIt’s not going to get filed today anyway, so can we please consider it? It’s gonna cost a lot more money to make it right in the future.\nI’m not gonna fuck this up, Christine. And please don’t take this as me trying to manipulate you. If you do just forget it.\nThanks\nSent:02/09/2024 at 01:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 01:34 PM)\nSubject:New RO\nMessage 1261 of 4024\nYowza... pretty Good Friday to close the week.\nI’ll look to get us “SAAS ready” on time.
