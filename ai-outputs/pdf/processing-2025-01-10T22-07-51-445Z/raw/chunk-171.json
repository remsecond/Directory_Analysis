Obviously ADs screen time is more intrusive than the things we had set\nup for us.\nWe had simple things like “joined the network” for anyone (Elsa, Christina, Ms Stephanie... etc) and it never said anyone’s name in the actual alert.\nBUT if you drilled into it you could kinda figure it out by looking at the device name- “Ms. Stephanie’ iPhone” and triangulating on the time it fired.\nThis (when we were a family) was important. You want to know if people are on your family’s network. They can do bad things to work laptops, kids\nstuff, etc...\nWhen I was in the fold, I tried hard to keep us all safe. Just like you file our taxes. We did what we know how to do as in an effort to keep the Moyer’s\nhumming.\nBUT!!! The big takeaway for you, is there were NEVER indoor cams. This hint is enough to infer things. So please know your privacy was NEVER\ninvaded.\nI will swear that’s true on my children’s life, Christine.\nI don’t want to hurt you. I still love you more than life.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 04:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1354.PNG (4 MB)\nMessage 1339 of 4024\nGot another but accidentally dismissed. It’s not going to kill me, we have had these for years. Just don’t arrest me for getting them. Because tbh, the\nvery last thing on earth I should be doing is telling you. Because that looks like I’m stalking you all when we both know (I hope) that I’m really trying\nto help you figure bout what is going on. Does that make sense?\nPlease don’t use this against me.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 06:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 06:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1340 of 4024\nThank you. It’s frustrating but I need to call and figure out why. Perhaps block the number in your contact list?\nSent:02/12/2024 at 06:25 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 06:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts",
