  "text": "Message 1170 of 4024\nOf course...\nI will be patient. I said it last night. I’ll repeat it today. You were my soulmate and still are my partner. I support you. I want you to thrive, Christine.\nI’ll say I don’t understand how work crazies could be weaponized? “Christine’s co-workers are late getting her information... she is a bad mom”\nThe only thing that was ever weaponized related to a regrettable work incident and our marriage. I assume that kind of thing isn’t happening.\nOn our path to normalcy, I hope we trust each other again. We both have just cause to doubt. But I want to trust my best friend of 29 years again.\nPlease let me know how I shoulder as much burden that I can. Don’t be shy. You shared your expectations for normalcy. Let’s do this!\nSent:02/07/2024 at 09:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 09:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Lisa Email to Anna Lisa\nMessage 1171 of 4024\nI think I fixed it btw. See attached. No shut offs in almost a month. I hope that’s helping keep the house temp more consistent without the shut\ndowns.\nIf this is monitoring (and maybe it is?) and you want me to cease and desist, please just let me know. I’m just trying to save us the 8k replacement cost.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 10:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 10:26 AM)\nSubject:Furnace\nAttachments:IMG_1286.PNG (351 KB)\nMessage 1172 of 4024\nIs there any way after coding I can shoot hoops with AD? He is noticeably falling behind his peers and selfishly I’d like to share a few laughs not in\npractice or a game.\nHappy to have him home whenever. I assure you a few games of Pig will only help our father/son relationship and it will only get better after Dr",
