  "text": "Message 1372 of 4024\nSo... why don't we try an icebreaker on Saturday? Let's look at stuff together.\nWe both have reasonably good taste. We can bounce thoughts off each other. And it gives us something very non-controversial to accomplish\nsomething together.\nDrop AD of after the game, let's meet at the Starbucks next door. And let the good times roll. We gotta start somewhere. This could not be a better,\neasier, safer, baby step. Let's do it!\nSent:02/13/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 06:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fernish\nMessage 1373 of 4024\nSo it might be time to step back from this. It is not working. I appreciate the civility we have shared over the last ten days, but the reality is we are not\none task closer to solving anything. And you don't reach out with the smallest olive branch to communicate with me, even with the last\nobstacle cleared by Anna Lisa. I don't anticipate any change. It is an established pattern, and I was misguided to think you might find the time or\nenergy but I am still glad I tried.\nBecause it's not about the RO. Has little to do with emails, texts, or calls. Or the fact that Xfinity spams me with alerts even after you took\nresponsibility a month ago. It's not about you attesting that I have and will beat you to the police. Or that you have five registered audio/video devices\nthat can drop in on my most private moments going back to my beach days. Or even Dr Brown's crazy misguided off-target effort that includes no\nreunification agenda. It is about the barriers.\nSee, those are just bumps in the road. Hindrances to the singular thing that matters. And that is if you believe our boys are better off without me. You\nhave wiped me, and our memories from the house. I assume you would format their brains if you could. And if by whatever means possible, believe\nthey should have me separated from their existence all altogether. This, all after the best spring and summer we could ever have had together.\nYou are omnipotent in this system and your actions demonstrate that eliminating a strong, sober, father figure is your desire. It is not a priority for our\nboys to have a biological father as a role model or a positive force in their lives, teaching them lessons learned and passing on wisdom from my failures.\nAfter banishing all positive memories perhaps, you will replace me soon. And with each passing day, it becomes their new narrative, engrained more\ndeeply,\nI acknowledge the challenges I have introduced into our lives, and I understand the expectation was for me to have navigated my childhood based on\nan innate moral compass and not pass anything I learned along. But now the question comes down to redemption and healing. And is that something\nwe should foster in these young men? Will it serve them better to face the past, do the work, and heal or should they continue down the path of\nalienation and punishment?\nYour stance suggests a preference for moving on without addressing the potential for reconciliation and growth. But this overlooks the essence of my\nattempts to communicate and reintegrate into our sons' lives, aiming to contribute positively to their development into resilient and capable\nindividuals. You may see it just as \"robert wants to text or call... no way\" but it misses the point. I'm trying to knock down obstacles that keep us from\naddressing the issues.\nSo as another day passes, you sign on for five minutes, spraying a couple of responses before going dark for the next five hours, only to rinse and repeat\ntwice more before you shut down, I urge you to reflect on the deeper reasons behind my persistence. I am striving to dismantle the barriers preventing\nour sons' healing. Please consider if it might be worth taking a moment from Starbucks or your social life, and sitting down to discuss our path\nSent:02/14/2024 at 12:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 06:53 AM)\nSubject:Happy Valentine's Day!",
