  "text": "Message 851 of 4024\nI would like to plan these things with you.\nI warned you this was going to happen. I saw your email for SAAS, moved money and you paid off the Amex you have not been using for months\ninstead.\nI am so tired of fighting, Christine. Please start working with me. I’ll do whatever I can to make this work. Please get one call approved for us.\nAnd btw, this new way is going to cost us tuition in no time. Please work with me. If it is not productive, we stop on the spot. But we are hurting\nhere.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 04:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS tuition payment\nMessage 852 of 4024\nI assume you are doing walkthrough and getting the TV out as discussed? If not let’s figure out how I can help. It was still a dump yesterday. I’m not\ntrying to fight. I want to problem solve with a deadline in a few hours so the kids have happy parents. Let me know the plan and how to coordinate\nsuccessfully. We are on the same team for this!\nSent:01/30/2024 at 05:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 853 of 4024\nYou are charging some things to Fidelity that I have no visibility to but decide to charge others to BofA that I can’t factor in as you give me no\nwarning.\nI told you balance for my Amex, the chase card under my name that you put all your Amazon and unrelated Amazon purchases on. That’s what we\nagreed the 40k was for.\nYou then pay off your Amex and lawyer fees that I have no visibility to with BofA . You use fidelity for expenses that I currently have no visibility too\neither so no idea what your are charging.\nBlaming a low balance in BofA for your hits that you give me no visibility to is strange.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 05:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS tuition payment\nMessage 854 of 4024\nNo I made it clear I was just in charge of move out clean and to let me know if anything else. I aligned that with landlord they would use their cleaners\nwho are cheaper and come out of deposit.,\nSent:01/30/2024 at 05:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 05:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki",
