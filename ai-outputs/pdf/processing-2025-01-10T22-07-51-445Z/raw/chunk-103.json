You said to the court I have committed domestic violence.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1139 of 4024\nGood Morning,\nI have your revised RO. Thank you for getting Anna Lisa to send. Two questions on the terms that I hope that you and I can discuss more cost-\neffectively than the lawyers.\nWRT - [x] Credible Threat: The Restrained Person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the Protected Person.\nYesterday you told the court I had committed domestic violence. Today you are asking me to sign something that says I am a physical threat to you\nand the kids. My hands have been there to tie shoes, wipe tears, hold ice packs, make love, walk hand in hand, morning hugs, and make love. That is all\nthey are for with you and the boys.\nThat is what you have seen and I hope you know is true this morning. Do we need to say you believe that I will beat you and my children? I can't\nimagine in the deepest depths of my despair over our dissolution I would seek you out and physically harm you or our boys. Must you say that you\nbelieve this to be untrue and you think I will beat you all?\nWRT - The parties may also communicate via email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or\nmanaging the parties’ shared assets.\nThanks again for this. Very helpful. But as I have noted on many occasions that OFW is a terrible platform for much of our communications. It is\nbetter as a single subject, single reply, 124 characters, non-copy paste, short burst text tool. Most of the time we communicate on emails we have\nseveral things we are trying to resolve in somewhat complex multi-point situations.\nAnd more often than not, we actually do not want to conduct our \"sausage-making\" in front of the diner who will eat it. But your offer proposes that\nthey always have to be present on the thread, we can't drop them, resolve, and add them back. Can you please reconsider?\nThanks again for your efforts to partner constructively in a positive way. Given this is a timely conversation and Lisa is waiting on my direction, it\nwould be great if we could resolve ASAP.\nbest\nrobert\nSent:02/06/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
