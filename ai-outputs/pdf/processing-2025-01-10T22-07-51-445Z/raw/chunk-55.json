You lead, I’ll follow.\nSecond- let’s jam out the request today. I want to be responsive and timely. Then let’s agree on a time and send a response that captures both in a\nsingle email and also asks if we can do this in person.\nWRT the impending divorce, it’s not our friend in this discussion so I’d prefer that we appear to be a happy, well adjusted family. That way it does\nnot look like ADs issue is really home life, and not ICS.\nIf that is controversial to you, let’s move to OFW to discuss.\nMessage 948 of 4024\nShe only offered zoom so let’s stick to that.\nI sent my times so you pick.\nI’m comfortable with you responding if you could add some language to reference the application already completed for the school year.\nI don’t think a teams call is needs for us to align.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 09:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Moving AD to SAAS\nMessage 949 of 4024\nThe teams call was because we don't agree on some of the approach and we could discuss.\nIf you are going to just insist on your way, then I guess we can do that too.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 09:56 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 09:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Moving AD to SAAS",
