  "text": "When it needed your updates, I did the same. I wanted to show you we could do something good together.\nPlease don’t find a reason not to do it.\nPlease provide a reason for us to partner.\nIt could make all the difference someday.\nMessage 1252 of 4024\nI truly appreciate the speed and attention you made to the responses and questions. I input into the system as it was first requirement for the\npreliminary application but I have been unable to submit it. I’m going to ask why on the call.\nI hope you have seen me move forward in the other front for teacher evaluation and transcripts with similar urgency.\nAgree that when we do partner together it can result in real synergies.\nMy hesitation is based on years of lived experience that I am only just unpacking. Anytime I would show or demonstrate a willingness to forgive,\nmove on, forget etc, it is rewarded briefly (days, weeks, sometimes months) with improved situation, but things have inevitably fallen back to\nbehaviors that have been traumatizing, scary, disrespectful etc. often times my accepting behavior is then weaponized against me in the most\nhumiliating or embarrassing way, to demonstrate my weakness or lack of judgment.\nI fully expect this to happen in our mediation and future interactions, so I am in a position that I can’t respond in ways I used to. It does not serve me\nwell.\nI don’t expect you to understand but that’s my explanation whether you accept or agree with it.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 10:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 11:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1253 of 4024\nI am not gonna fight your explanation. I realize I have a demonstrated track record. What I am asking you to please do for the sake of us. Moving\nforward is to try one baby step in the right direction.\nI can assure you there will be no trauma no ill will at all. it will be as I said an opportunity for you and I to celebrate something positive that we did\ntogether. Changing the way that we were because I did not know about it. I was not aware of it. I am now.\nI am trying to make the change, but if you do not give me an opportunity to show you that, it will never happen. And we are doomed to this life of\nhating each other. This is one hour. Please give me the chance for one hour Christine.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 11:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 11:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1254 of 4024\nI believe it is 30 mins.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 11:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 11:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting",
