  "text": "You never installed the Beach Cams either. But I had shared them with you (indoor and outdoor) and knew those worked, but never installed the app\nfor those.\nThat said, you also never installed:\n- Nest App- It works well, you are aware of it, and never installed it, but ask me to use it for you.\n- Sleep Number App- It is also helpful but you never installed it. But maybe just did not need to.\n- Frame Apps- We had them in the living room and used them daily. You choose not to install.\n- Samsung App- It sets the picture you see in the cat room and bedroom. You did not install.\n- Alexa- You still have several cam/audio devices that can drop in on me. Not sure what's up.\nWhen we were a loving couple doing our own thing, lots of times I would be geeked out on something, you would smile and nod, feign interest but\nnot really act. That was normal.\nTwo: \"If we had them, I would have remembered them?\"\nI don't have any reason to believe you would not, so this may be true too. And I won't fight if you really believe that you have no memory of that. I\nwill say that we do forget things sometimes, however. Everyone does.\nThis could be a long list, but you will get the point:\nCarbon Monoxide Detector- I made a pretty big deal of this, explaining that I always am sure to take them on vacation with us. I talked about why I\ndo that and all the crazy AirBnB stories that made me scared. I wanted to protect our family and noted that I would be taking it to protect your\nbrother along with Justin and Josh. For some reason, it was being used as a WiFi repeater in your clear line of the site where you spend hours every\nweek. Maybe you forgot?\nPrivate Moments- I asked you recently if you remember our Hyatt stay. You didn't. This surprised me. It was one of the few times we made time for\nan overnight together. In the end, we bickered on the way home, but that night, and especially the morning, was an all-time great freaking sweaty, sexy\ntime. WOW!! And.. we took crazy explicit pics of you. By far the hardest core thing we ever did. Face and all. I won't attach pics. I would think you\nwould remember, but don't.\nMy point is everyone forgets things but believes they are absolutely in command of the facts. I have even watched Netflix documentaries on it. It is\ncalled the \"eyewitness memory distortion \" effect. It's a fascinating human phenomenon and it's super interesting to see it broken down and explained.\nThat said, who knows, maybe I did not even mention it to you. I may be guilty of the same thing and thought I told you but didn't. But like the\n\"Alexa drop in\" we used often at times; it was just normal when we were a happy family. We did not think of it as spying.\nThis is of course equally true of:\n- Our shared ATT family plan\n- Parental control for the kids\n- Screen time alerts for the kids\n- New device joining Xfinity alerts\nI don't really care about what the Luddites in the family law world or the perversion of good intentions into bad, that this has become. When we were\na happy family, this was all approved, discussed, and, welcomed. Protecting your kids in the real world is expected. And phone bills have had call/text\nhistory since long before cell phones even existed.\nYou didn't ask about things rejoining the network today or about alerts that pop like Blink did. But you have seen them with Samsung Alerts. So, at a\nminimum, you have to realize this is a true and demonstratable network phenomenon. I can also prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the cams DO\nNOT work in the places you saw them, in the open, pointing at exterior doors.\nAt this point, I have digressed. But you asked two questions about the cams, and I wanted to give you, my thoughts. If in reading this, you think that\nit is simply impossible that what I am saying could ever be true, that's you right. I am only offering my true and honest perspective on the event that\nhas traumatized you, because I never had any desire to surveil you.... ever.\nAs mentioned, many times before I am happy to prove this to you in front of your eyes. I have also told you that I bought the new ones at the",
