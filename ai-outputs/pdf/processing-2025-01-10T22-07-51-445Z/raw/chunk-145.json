I would never question what a great mom you are.\nI am only asking if per chance we could make a step in the right direction to be good coparents. The kids will know if we hate each other.\nI understand that it’s not happening today. And I’m not gonna fight you on it. But please consider another opportunity in the future.

I can be a good partner.\nI would really like to test my zoom set up if you can let me know please\nSent:02/09/2024 at 11:34 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 11:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1256 of 4024\nHow do we do a test?\nSent:02/09/2024 at 11:44 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 12:23 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1257 of 4024\nCan i zoom or teams you?\nSent:02/09/2024 at 12:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 12:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1258 of 4024\nTeams\nSent:02/09/2024 at 12:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 12:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1259 of 4024\nSent the running list invite.
