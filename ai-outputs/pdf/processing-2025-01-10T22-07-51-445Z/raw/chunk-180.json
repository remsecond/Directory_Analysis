  "text": "Message 1367 of 4024\nI have mentioned we are out of Fernish coverage area. So I planned to go get a Cost-Plus world market table. But when I got my Starbucks, this AM I\nthought i had nothing to lose by going into the Bellevue Consignment store. Wham!!! Jackpot! This table is so much better than what I was looking at\ncost plus. It is a huge store and I think you might be able to find stuff for the cat room there. Plus, they have a very reasonable delivery service, or you\ncan use Devan? It's worth a look since it is SO much easier the Craigslist. I'm going to start there from now on.\nHave a great day!!!\nSent:02/13/2024 at 03:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 06:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fernish\nAttachments:image_167806977.JPG (1 MB)\nimage_67530241.JPG (4 MB)\nMessage 1368 of 4024\n.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 06:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 06:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1364.PNG (295 KB)\nMessage 1369 of 4024\nThank you for sharing.
