I am sorry, and hope that it is nothing on fire, but it usually is. Good luck with all\nthat. You are the consummate plate spinner.\nI think you know the issues, and it sounds like we need two corrections, and chat before we need a 3rd... lol\nI really hope you and I get to the stage where we take the reins back. Just fixing this stuff will cost a few K.\nI'll be leaving in about an hour. I'll see if you had time to check-in. If not, I'll work around your schedule!\nWe both want to address these, so I assure you I am not going to harass you. Take your time and take care!\nTeamwork!!!\nSent:02/06/2024 at 05:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 06:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse <<4:15 Meeting Update>>\nMessage 1160 of 4024\nHey, I had to finally go to Nordstrom’s today and buy some new jeans. It was like $700 so I wanted to get it on your radar. I also got AD his\nreplacement jacket.\nWhen I got home, I realized that all my baggy ones were 32s that I got a couple months ago. Since the new ones are 31s, I might just go back and get\n30s.\nI’m trying to be smart about it but I haven’t been this size since junior high. I keep thinking it will stop and it’s safe to buy but I just keep getting\nthinner.\nI’ll keep looking on eBay too.\nWhy couldn’t I look this good when we were married?\nSent:02/06/2024 at 11:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 05:18 AM)\nSubject:Spend Today",
