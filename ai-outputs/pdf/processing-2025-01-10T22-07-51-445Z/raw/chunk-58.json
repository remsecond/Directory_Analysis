I assume it’s because we moved me off your plan?\nI assume I should go for it then. Just trying to be respectful of our community assets.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 01:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: ADHD- Max’s Vyvanse\nMessage 960 of 4024\nSo the way I I make sure Max feels safe but welcome is we chat a bit to catch up. And then I will offer something to do together like this \"Hey, I know\nyou probably already have plans, but if they fall through, I'd love to XYZ with you, so just let me know\" He always does but at least he knows the\noffer is there and I'm thinking of him.\nI'd like to do the same for AD this afternoon to shoot some hoops here. It is gorgeous and would be fun. Just so you are aware, he and I have been\nhaving some deep, AD lead conversations- Cabo, Whistler, Hawaii, and Vegas. We have touched them all. He wants me to understand the impact it\nhas had on him, and know why I did that.\nEvery time we go there, just like when he has asked me to blow, I am very positive and reassuring. I thank him sincerely for not turning his back on me\nand loving me enough to have a difficult conversation that makes him feel uncomfortable. It is a true sign of unconditional love. I appreciate it and\nwant him to know I'm an open book.\nSo, with those things noted:\n- Gorgeous day to shoot some hoops\n- A safe way to bow out of an offer to play\n- We are having important conversations\nI'd like to see if he wants to shoot hoops for an hour. I take him to practice. You pick him up!\nI don't see a down said but appreciate your concerns in advance. I hope you can find a way to let \"us work on us\" in a safe space (nothing safer and\nmore comfortable than a game of pig for me and him) in a small-time boxed opportunity until you and I have a longer discussion/explanation.\nthanks!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 02:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD",
