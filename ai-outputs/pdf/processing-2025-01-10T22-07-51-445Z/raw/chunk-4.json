I arranged for him to use his cleaners for move out so they can do it based on timing that works best after repairs. , he said it would be cheaper\nthan my quote from Twinkle.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 09:48 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 829 of 4024\nYes we are here safely.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 09:48 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safe Arrival\nMessage 830 of 4024\nOk. I appreciate the reply. But I have noted that you do not really reply several times. And you still do not really reply. Here or on the other threads\nwhere you requested info. I shared it, then you go dark.\nAt first you asked questions, I responded. I brought up issues that are both substantive and important to address for our children and I am only using\nOFW as intended for the topics it was intended for.\nNothing on the “beating you and the kids” in RO\nNothing on your Dr Brown next steps or timing\nNothing in the possible running list discussion\nNothing on a future path to normalization again\nNothing helpful on you owning BofA account\nNothing on timing of all this just as Lisa goes out\nNo agreement on SAAS, you unilaterally decided\nThe only thing you bothered mentioning twice was what you wanted to know about- The Xfinity alerts.\nI’m not upset, but I recognize it appears I am being played. There appears to be no sincere effort here.\nIt’s unfortunate as I was really acting in good faith per your instructions and hoped to make progress.\nGive Anna Lisa my best. The “two word” answer blueprint worked for you today. I’ll step back now.\nThank You for the Thank You\nSent:01/26/2024 at 11:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/27/2024 at 07:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>",
