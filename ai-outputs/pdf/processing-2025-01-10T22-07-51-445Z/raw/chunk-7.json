  "text": "Message 835 of 4024\nThe communication sent to the boys with video which they sent to me because it was so alarming in nature and indicates continuing monitoring is\nbelow. I have shared with my lawyer and guess will address when yours is back.\nAlso attaching soberlink test results which indicates you have found the device just choosing not to use it and doing tests spaced 1 minute apart.\nI’ll share JUST the Alexa devices in this video to show you the things we have that light up and throw alerts. We were a geek family ...\nWe have around 60 Xfinity connections- Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, nest, smart bed, picture frames... they all give a signal when they are used.\nThen we have ATT. That shows all data, by text, phone, streaming, time and date. So we can see every number we text or call and when we did it.\nThen you have other connected home apps, Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home, etc... all can control, alert, light each other up.\nThis happens if something is connected or has recently reconnected for the first time in months. The Alexa’s do it all the time. So do the cams.\nAnything with WiFi.\nWe can literally tell almost anything about what each other is doing with these signals from Xfinity and ATT\n- Total screen time\n- Tick Toc time spent\n- YouTube visit frequency\n- Websites you visited\n- When you get home\n- When you leave home\n- Who you text/call\n- Naughty sites you visit\nAll of this is a good thing when you are one happy family. It’s safe protection. But if someone suddenly gets kicked off the island then it’s called\nspying.\nAnyway... we can play a fun game where you describe “how could you know if I xyz” and I’ll tell ya. You will be amazed! But smarter!\nLove you guys!\nThat’s all for tonight\nSent:01/29/2024 at 09:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/29/2024 at 09:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: WiFi/connected devices/kids communication\nAttachments:IMG_9566.PNG (396 KB)\nMessage 836 of 4024\nSent:01/29/2024 at 09:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 06:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: WiFi/connected devices/kids communication\nAttachments:IMG_1189.PNG (116 KB)",
