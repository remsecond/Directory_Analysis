I’m going to tell AD I love him and I have all his stuff packed up ready to go back to Kirkland. I have always told him I was proud of him for sharing
his concerns and will continue to do so.
I also would like to share what happened so he knows my explanation and that I agree with what he saw. I need to let him know I can’t see him
anymore but I love him dearly and he can always call.
I know we have plans for Dr Brown but I don’t know what they are and I think I have accepted after all these months of trying to get something,
anything in place, i just won’t see my boys again.
I’m not a victim, there is just always a reason that all this horrible nightmare won’t end. And if it’s all my fault - you, the kids, retirement, I need to
eventually accept the blame and start a new life.
Please be there for AD... I don’t want him upset but at some point I have to be honest and stop leading him on. We FaceTime every day so he can see
progress. Its super fun but It’s not right to keep that lie going. He will never trust me if I do.

His room is all re-packed. I finished today. It’s not a ton of stuff but it is meaningful. That is why it was here. I’ll be sure Elsa brings it all back so don’t
want him to think I just took it and had no plans to return.

Sorry. Last thing (I hope) I put the new basketball goal and ping pong table on Craigslist. If you want to send pics of the peloton or other things, I can
mange all at once.
Or we can wait till it gets here if that ever happens in our new world. For that matter I guess the ping pong table could get moved to Kirkland too. It’s
nice but only 90% together.
I’m out. It’s been a hard day. Have a safe trip. I’m trying to remove you as my emergency contact too.

Circling back... so many issues in this thread. In the past, I think I would be fighting and striking back.
I think the first biggie is if you wanted to include the part in the RO that says I have and am likely to beat you and the kids again. Paraphrasing of
course.
The second biggie was the Dr Brown proposal. I do not understand how we hope she can heal us or what the plan is. I'd love to try and work with
you.
I am not in a fighting mood. I accept m responsibility for this and our entire marriage. I have apologized for everything that I have done.
I would just like to know how/if we can work together for the benefit of the Moyers. So, I'll take the drive by fire. But hope we can do more.

Do you mind letting me know the Canada agenda since it is an international trip? Just for peace of mind.

Ok. I appreciate the reply. But I have noted that you do not really reply several times. And you still do not really reply. Here or on the other threads
where you requested info. I shared it, then you go dark.
At first you asked questions, I responded. I brought up issues that are both substantive and important to address for our children and I am only using
OFW as intended for the topics it was intended for.
Nothing on the “beating you and the kids” in RO
Nothing on your Dr Brown next steps or timing
Nothing in the possible running list discussion
Nothing on a future path to normalization again
Nothing helpful on you owning BofA account
Nothing on timing of all this just as Lisa goes out
No agreement on SAAS, you unilaterally decided
The only thing you bothered mentioning twice was what you wanted to know about- The Xfinity alerts.
I’m not upset, but I recognize it appears I am being played. There appears to be no sincere effort here.
It’s unfortunate as I was really acting in good faith per your instructions and hoped to make progress.
Give Anna Lisa my best. The “two word” answer blueprint worked for you today. I’ll step back now.

I just recognized what I find difficult about your emails. The ask is often buried in a long discussion of complaints and feelings. The list below is
helpful as I can see exactly what is outstanding, but when surrounded by extra words that are unhelpful, the focus moves away.
Ask for future emails to be concise about ask without superfluous language.
RO language. I’ll need to review. I assume you discussed with lawyer and agreed to content,
Dr. Brown. I suggested to reach out and request engagement to assist on how to navigate this situation, with her individual speaking with You, myself,
Adrian and Elsa. I disagree what was in The letter for how we use her reccomendations as it should be for guidance only, and my lawyer will respond
to Lisa.
Running list discussion. I am not comfortable with a call at this time.
Path to normalization is with assistance of Dr. Brown.
BofA account. It is a joint account as I understand we both access. You were to set up your own account. I have not seen boys money from Beth
deposited into their accounts but I assumed you cashed, paid off credit card for Bend bills (700 flight charge was actually booked to my Amex as your
delta account defaulted to my Amex which has now been updated) and were going to transfer money to boys account for their Christmas gifts.
I could not time discovery of cameras and subsequent steps I need to take to ensure safety. I don’t control your actions that needed to be address. It’s
unfortunate Lisa is unavailable to help you navigate. .
SAAS we had discussions you would reach out and apparently told Adrian you had. When he told me you had and asked about response that’s when
I started asking you and you never responded. I have not reached out to Jonathan yet but plan to do so so he has an email Monday am. If you disagree
let me know and proposed next steps
Xfinity. Noted you have confirmed alerts have stopped. If they reappear my expectation is that you will inform me. I will ask my lawyer to formalize
that request to Lisa.
Going to engage with the group now and enjoy whistler.
Hope the basketball game goes well. I’m sure Joe and team is grateful for you to step in.

Hi Robert,
Adrian shared a video you sent him and Max in regards to all devices that you have access to and are connected to via WiFi. It was confusing to me and
Adrian was very confused as he believes he is still being monitored and is very concerned and anxious.
Can you provide a list of all devices you are still connected to in the Kirkland residence or have notifications or access to? Per letter from your lawyer
the Xfinity’s notifications was the only one that was remaining.
I understand the Xfinity’s alerts to you should have been stopped and you would provide notification if this was not the case.

Hi Christine-
I do not have access to any of those devices. They show in my Alexa account because I bought them at some point over the last >10 years. They just
get associated with my account as the purchaser.
That said we have intentionally connected them in the past of a matter of convenience and automation when we were one big happy family. It made
sense. But I don’t have any connection with them now.
I spent some time talking to AD today. Like a lot. Very deep. Really thoughtful. I also discussed the event we shared, and what the video was showing.
It would be great to further those conversations ASAP.
As for Xfinity, I’m still locked out. We spent quite a bit of time trying to get me in by changing user names and passwords. Still no luck so I cant see
anything I should. But no new Kirkland alerts I think?
I’m also not able to make changes to my ATT. Double factor auth goes to your Hotmail. So you’re the gatekeeper. But not sure how to fix unless you
do it, but you can’t log in to get that far. Catch-22?
I’m happy to continue to offer assistance in any way I can but back and forth “gotcha OFW” messages are not going to interest me. Especially with no
counsel in town. I just wanted to put you at ease tonight.

The communication sent to the boys with video which they sent to me because it was so alarming in nature and indicates continuing monitoring is
below. I have shared with my lawyer and guess will address when yours is back.
Also attaching soberlink test results which indicates you have found the device just choosing not to use it and doing tests spaced 1 minute apart.
I’ll share JUST the Alexa devices in this video to show you the things we have that light up and throw alerts. We were a geek family ... 
We have around 60 Xfinity connections- Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, nest, smart bed, picture frames... they all give a signal when they are used.
Then we have ATT. That shows all data, by text, phone, streaming, time and date. So we can see every number we text or call and when we did it.
Then you have other connected home apps, Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home, etc... all can control, alert, light each other up.
This happens if something is connected or has recently reconnected for the first time in months. The Alexa’s do it all the time. So do the cams.
Anything with WiFi.
We can literally tell almost anything about what each other is doing with these signals from Xfinity and ATT
- Total screen time
- Tick Toc time spent
- YouTube visit frequency
- Websites you visited
- When you get home
- When you leave home
- Who you text/call
- Naughty sites you visit
All of this is a good thing when you are one happy family. It’s safe protection. But if someone suddenly gets kicked off the island then it’s called
spying.
Anyway... we can play a fun game where you describe “how could you know if I xyz” and I’ll tell ya. You will be amazed! But smarter!
Love you guys!

I’m sorry you are taking this approach when I was trying to be helpful. If you would like to drive over right now, I’ll hand you my phone, go in the
other room and let you try to connect to anything in the house. You will not have any luck.
The billing address for my Amazon account is 1210 Kirkland ave. So every device gets set up there by default. So it looks like I have access to things at
that address. That is not the case. I’m sharing everything, and trying to explain transparently.
If you read my note to the boys, you will see it is just trying to explain the signals we get and how they can be used and interpreted. I’ve tried to tell
you many times as well and it is the reason I insisted we separate the ATT and Xfinity accounts.
If you would stop using OFW as an assault tool to send to Anna Lisa, and want to work together as Lisa mentioned, I am available, but you just don’t
even care to learn the basics. If we sit, your phone, my phone we can stop this nonsense in 30 minutes.
Wrt the SoberLink. I found it when i was at the beach. Packed another load, and it was in the boxes again last night. I pee tested today for you so you
could see I’m clean on my own. But I thought it was to see the kids which you don’t allow anymore?
P.S. I just reread my explanation. Why is any of that wrong? It’s spot on. I’ll play the same game with you. It’s all there and real. It’s literally a selling
point for each service. They advertise it. Not punish people who use it. I feel like I’m traveling back in time.
See attached. I can send as many as you like. They are registered to you. And offline. And given they are 8’ish years old before I even had an Amazon
account I guess I should ask you how you made them show up on my app. I’m trying to explain this to you.
tbh- this is all nuts. It’s beyond nuts. Being an intentional Luddite does not make me a criminal. And the fact that you insisted I beat you and my kids
recently and am a threat to do it again in an RO is insane. Every day this is more unhinged.

Your dad's message describes various ways that digital devices and services can track and record user activity. His claims are very accurate, as many
modern devices and services do have the capability to monitor and log various types of usage data.
Here's a breakdown of the key points mentioned in the message:
1. **Xfinity Connections (e.g., Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, Nest, smart beds, picture frames):** These devices, when connected to a home
network like Xfinity, can indeed transmit signals indicating their usage. For example, a smart bed might record when it's being used, and a Wi-Fi-
connected picture frame could log when new photos are viewed.
2. **AT&T Data (text, phone, streaming, time, and date):** Telecommunication providers like AT&T can track data usage details. They typically
have records of calls and texts (including the time and the number contacted), as well as data usage details for streaming and internet browsing.
3. **Connected Home Apps (Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home):** These apps and devices can interact with each other, often
providing notifications or logs of activity. For example, a smart home system might log when lights are turned on or off, or when a door is opened or
closed.
4. **Alexa and Cameras:** Devices like Alexa (Amazon's virtual assistant) and Wi-Fi-enabled cameras can provide significant amounts of data. Alexa,
for instance, records voice commands, and cameras can log when they detect motion or are accessed.
5. **Detailed Activity Tracking:** The ability to track specific activities like total screen time, time spent on specific apps like TikTok or YouTube,
visited websites, and even the tracking of location (such as when someone leaves or arrives home) is possible with the right setup and permissions. 
6. **Monitoring Texts/Calls and Visited Websites:** It's indeed possible to see who you text or call and what websites you visit, especially if the
network or devices are configured to track this information.
All these capabilities exist, and it's important to note that accessing and interpreting this data often requires specific permissions and sometimes
technical know-how. In a family setting, monitoring is viewed as a safety measure, but it's crucial to balance safety with privacy and trust. The
perception of such monitoring as either protective or invasive can vary greatly depending on the context and the individuals involved. 
In conclusion, all the technical aspects of your dad's message are accurate, but whether this constitutes 'spying' or 'protection' can be subjective and
depends on whether this was initially set up for family safety and convenience or implemented as a way to surveil. Remember these services are offered
to protect families, not spy.

I have some legacy address settings that still get applied to some items. Would you mind bringing mail and packages to Adrian’s practices till these are
worked out of the system?
BTW- I am still stumped on how to explain the standard services and gadgets we have in a way that you and the boys will understand. It feels like you
all have so limited knowledge it’s a non-starter.
I wonder if there is an immediate solution to host a safe discussion. Perhaps with Elsa, Milo, Katherine there. Someone who knows tech at least the
basics. Because we are just spinning right now.
Or would you like me to search out YouTube videos, author a deck? You guys are just so so far off wrt to understanding even the most basic things we
can’t have a productive discussion. It’s frustrating.
Can you imagine trying to explain accounting to someone who doesn’t known what numbers are? To them, they are just symbols, or little squiggly
pictures on a page. That’s literally where we are now.
Sending this to Anna Lisa in the end is not helpful. If
you have a question or concern we have to address it. It’s all very straightforward and easy if you take the time. Can we find a safe space for that
conversation?

I would like to have the Lugg sent to my house. But, I don’t need more junk. You sent actual bags of trash last time instead of the list of documented

The text messages is accurate. We have family plans, Christine. Please go into yours and you can see what is tracked for yourself. This is a service. This
is not spying. I keep explaining that.
If everyone wants to pay for their own accounts that is fine. Phone, internet, Netflix, Xbox, office. We did this as a family till you did your thing. That
is normal. Please don’t present it as otherwise.
If everyone chooses to be thier own person, and ignore that we are a family, that is ok. But i will not be expecting to pay the bills for that. It is an
unnatural act. If you are not family, you are not.
The game suggested is very real. I am trying to teach you all about your digital footprint. It is not spying, like the way schools offer internet safety
courses. Knowledge is actually helpful to us all.
And per your last line. You are mixing metaphors. Please stop! You can see phone calls and texts. But who wants to? Who cares? Please see ChatGPT
explaining this to you to educate yourself.
Can we PLEASE facilitate a safe discussion so I can do as i have offered. Back and forth here is useless. It is straightforward if you don’t mix and

Each data point is very specific. Acting like this is one big tracking report is inaccurate. Please let me help you understand what you are mixing up. A

Did you understand this incredibly clear explanation from both me and the fact check from the foremost AI tool known to man?
It’s so good that there has been congressional testimony around the possibility and timing of when it could become sentient.
If none of that convinces you, then you are either incapable of understand, or being intentionally uninformed. Not sure what to do.
Please share this with the boys if it helps. But, for the love of god, please allow me to explain this if it scares them. It’s all very real and relevant.

This has all come down to one issue. Period. You and the boys think I am tracking you. It comes up on every thread.
You make statements that are true for one scenario and false in another. But accuracy is important in this discussion.
Please find a way to facilitate a discussion and education on what we have now or had as a happy family before.
Then we can severe what we want, as I asked you to do for my own safety for Xfinity and ATT accounts. It’s super simple.
But to keep spinning and trying to create lawyer bait is really unhelpful. Please stop. Please let me answer your questions.
This will have a long term impact on our family if we keep deceiving our kids by intentionally not educating them. Please stop.

See your text to them. If it misled them that’s on you in regards to your communication.
Putting blame on me is unbelievable given the nefarious monitoring cameras you put up without my knowledge. No one believes your explanation

I still need log in credentials to the blink account I have never had knowledge of or access to. Deleting an app does not delete an account.
For employment, if you are saying you are no longer employable because of the RO, that’s your position and we will prepare our side accordingly.
The RO was a result of your direct actions. You are not the victim here but us. If you disagreed then you and lawyer should not have signed it. I

plan which I am going to request."
I'm super bummed our kids think there is spying going on and I'm not sure they are getting the most accurate answers to their concerns. So I hope
you can help. To close on the phone and text messaging comments, I want to clarify the history of call/text reporting, the nature of these reports, and
our mutual access to them as account holders. And when I was thinking about it, I realized they have likely never even seen a paper phone bill.
I hope you will tell them that the activity described, which includes calls and texts, has long been a standard practice by phone companies that began
in the 1980s for long-distance calls. Which were expensive. The purpose was to ensure billing accuracy and transparency to customers so they could
manage phone usage. This used to terrify me when I would sneak down River Oaks Parkway every night to secretly call you in Hong Kong.
So as account holders, we both have always had access to this information. It is our family plan after all. I even think we used to get a paper bill
ourselves. But it's not a form of surveillance by me or you. It's a standard feature by ATT for accountability, fraud detection, and accurate record-
keeping. And your status as an account holder inherently includes consent to reporting your data back to you as a part of the service agreement, we
have.
I get without context and having never seen the fat white and blue envelopes with tens of lines of numbers inside, they don't have history. They don't
realize that roommates or families would grab a highlighter and take turns finding their boy or girlfriend's phone number and say which calls were
theirs. Then pull out the calculator to total everyone's share of the bill, just like we did with restaurant tabs when we would split up a big dinner bill.
They should know that our intention was never to monitor or surveil their phone usage. The logs on our bill for phone and text records is just a
routine aspect of our phone service. It has gone on for decades now for good reason. It started with paper fifty years ago and has since largely moved
to an online bill where it's possible to filter, sort, pivot, and categorize history just like you can do with any online date. But it's not spying now or
then.
I hope since you have their ear, and I can't teach them like I used to do, you will explain so they understand. It's just good parenting, and I trust you
will convey the message and ease their unfounded fears. I think we all grew up knowing that every number we dialed would show on the bill so we
sure as hell better not spend all night on the phone with our future wife in Asia. It's just funny how we lost that history and the tribal knowledge
since.
Thanks!

Is due Feb 7 in amount of 7,612 to cover Max’s ongoing school enrollment,
With a balance of 6.7k in BofA currently which is  insufficient funds to cover tuition in BofA plus ongoing expenses.
The 40k transferred was to cover my Amex card for 13k plus Chase/Amazon account for 28k.
When I looked you had paid off your Amex for 9.5k (I had no visibility balance) and your lawyer bill of 3.6k  which was not factored into the 40k. We
also had to pay deposit of 3.6k for SAAS reenrollment which was shared.
Given that, I had only paid off 20k of chase so there remains 8k balance before new charges and I haven’t paid Alaska card of 2.5k.
Let me know when funds will be transferred.

I told you balance for my Amex, the chase card under my name that you put all your Amazon and unrelated Amazon purchases on. That’s what we
agreed the 40k was for.
You then pay off your Amex and lawyer fees that I have no visibility to with BofA . You use fidelity for expenses that I currently have no visibility too
either so no idea what your are charging.

I think we will cancel Rec Hoops practice Friday. Most kids have a dance and Joe is OOF as well. It would be good a good opportunity to let AD
practice AAU this week for a change. That said the quality of play on this particular team (with some exceptions) is pretty freaking good.
I am a little worried about his health. We both agree he was under the weather. I appreciate he wanted to do it. but it's also sketch to try and play at
50%. If he is sick on Sat I might have to tell him he can't play. But he should support the team if possible. Just keep me updated.
I'll be coaching solo again this week on Sat. It was good of Surya to let me know that his dad was complaining about his playing time and they wanted
him in the game more this week... lol Seems like a nice guy but it's a dick move. Take over boss.. show is all yours.

- Know if even switching this year is an option for us now
- What a reasonable plan would be if he could not move
- Want to start something we are not 100% prepared to act on
- Know if the financial situation is going to be an issue for us
And as an aside, we really need to know what this whole thing means to our future fiscal viability.
I have always hoped we would be civil and even aligned well enough we could think big picture in terms of the actual execution date of the final
paperwork so we could "be divorced" but if it was going to make a ~100k difference (making up a number) that we would be flexible on the date given
all the long term implications.  But even saying that given recent history is kicking a bees nest so let's table that. I assume we won't have that luxury. I
can dream.
So we need to make some assumptions we are not sure will come to pass and come up with a roadmap that assures he can go to SAAS and what it
takes to make that happen. The elephant in the room is when I can find work. That helps a lot with our planning. Even if we have no idea what our
split looks like, we know more money and a dependable revenue stream always helps, no matter what. That is not a debate.
So, there is another bee's nest. As I am wandering around this place, up since five as usual, trying to sort my life from bags and boxes, as you and I
normally are manning our battle stations for the day (again maybe all my fault) I have to be realistic about trying to start an entirely new life (you were
able to continue your sans me), attend therapy, and be ready for the next crazy, while trying to land a job at Amazon or Google. We know the toll that
took on me when you were fully in my corner. So that weighs on my mind as I apply for jobs. And tbh, in my mind there is just no way I can work if
things are like they are now (my fault or not) or even land a job.
So... without a fight, we need to decide if we have enough confidence in our direction and desired decision to make a Go/No Go call on the bullets
above. The reality is we can, we are just at a high risk of getting ourselves into a situation that we cannot sustain. My feeling is we need to have a really
honest discussion about what we see as our next steps. SAAS is a little microcosm of our macro picture that could be a forcing function for us. I went
WAY OFF into the weeds but wanted you to understand my perspective. I want to work. I want to be settled. I want stability. I want to be what I was
to our family for 25 years without the bad parts.
But I am not confident I can do all that in the status quo. But I can assure you my goal is to continue to provide support for my family, monetarily
and emotionally for - you and the kids. That was my lifelong commitment, no matter what.  But it's not going to be solved in OFW. And I am not
pushing you to go off OFW. I am asking for realistic ideas for how we have a peaceful and planful discussion on SAAS right now along with an
acknowledgment of the macro factors that I am trying to consider every day. If this in any way has kicked off a fight, please let me withdraw the
thoughts above and just get back to a SAAS decision this week.
 What would you like to do?

into normalcy again. Perhaps even what we can look like as a mature family embracing the next chapter and reassuring him it will be even better than
the last. That is why we are doing this after all, and thus far it's a promise not kept. 
So this is the 911 call AD deserves right now. He needs to see we are listening to him, and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most
importantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life. When he needs us, we will drop anything:  appointments,
schedules, our problems, for him. We put our differences aside and find one voice between us, as it should be when he needs us most.   
Proposing you and I do the following:
We try and meet AD where he is, and you even serve as gentle training wheels for us
- I call him tomorrow and say we should all get together to discuss the SAAS option
- I ask if I could come grab him after school Friday to help clean up for a big family meeting
- I pick him up wearing the Homer Simpson shirt he got and a new Nike Tech replacement.
- We go to my place and I show him the progress on all his ideas at the place he picked out
- We decide on a to-do list of home improvements to make it shine before the SAAS summit.
Now it's his day! He is number one and sees it in action. He has a gentle re-entry with Dad as we work on a todo list and we can talk about where he is
at. We get things in order and prepare for Mom!!! Now this is something he never thought that could happen last Monday. 
- When you arrive, AD gives you a tour of the place that he picked out and shows off.
- Mom let's him know how pleased and proud of him she is and that he has great ideas.
- We make some popcorn and serve some drinks and he can play host a bit for Mom
- Then we talk about SAAS. largely info we know already, but he has a voice to hear 
- We make some foregone conclusions, but he feels like he is driving the decisions
- We can even play a game of ping pong to feel normal again for once since July
Afterward, Dad can serve juicy steaks or Mom and AD head back to Kirkland. Ad knows he is first in our lives and has confidence after seeing us
together that there is no more "lost in our mess" he feels today.
If we can please do this, and put our issues aside, I assure you this could be a game changer on so many levels and possibly accelerate some of the
healing even before we get in front of the shrinks!
It is so important right now that he sees Mom and Dad do what was impossible before. He will go home happy, with hope. It won't solve everything
nor diminish the hard work ahead. But, for a night, he sees anything is possible and perhaps this new life might not be so bad after all. 
Remember, I proposed to you to get you back into the Family Photos and we spent the last 29 years together raising three wonderful kids. I hope you
will trust me on this one too!
Please don't say no...

Message 897 of 4024
Just had an interesting conversation with her. I called to be sure that she knew phone numbers showed up on our bill but it exploded into how I
ruined her life. I may not agree with some of her characterizations, but that does not matter. It is her perspective. Her perception that it was me alone
trying to figure out what was going on in High School was surprising but understandable.
She told me she saw the cameras in September and thought you had put them up. I wish we had the discussion then. But it was a small point to what
she opened my eyes to. And it is consistent with the talk track you have played to me. That in my alcoholic years, you felt a need to acquiesce to me.
You were just trying to keep the peace and not rock the boat. I needed to hear that.
I understood then as she snuck boys into her room, sent underage porn on her phone, vomited vodka over both sides of the truck (she had been
driving), lost a six-figure full ride to college shoplifting for a boy, and made LBGTQ offensive online posts, what we were doing to get her back on the
rails was mutually agree to. we both were trying to sus things out together.
But her perspective is that it was all me and has always been all me. And now this incident is just a continuation of that behavior. It is important to me
that I know now that I am seen as the villain in this family. That we were not the team I thought we were. And at least in her mind (and maybe yours)
I was doing all these things to be nefarious and ruin her life. I need to think on that. 
But most important is the insight into where I think you are coming from. I thought as we were raising our kids we were aligned. But you are washing
your hands clean of that. That this was all me and you had nothing to do with it. It is a history that does not match mine. But I was an active alcoholic
so maybe I was missing things that you were telling me or misinterpreting things.
Either way, it was a deep and insightful lens into the narrative you and the kids have. And at this point in my life, it helps explain a lot. I believe
marriage takes two, but if the perspective is it was all me as some despotic ruler, I want to acknowledge that and do some soul-searching on how this
came to pass. How I thought we were making parenting decisions together but were not.
It has been said that "If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”
Maybe I'm that asshole...

I hate OFW formatting...
Without the running list discussion, our list is piling up quickly and will only get worse. We can do it this way and still live, but it's not going to be
good for us or the kids, and probably bankrupt us in the end. 
Then there is also the reality of situations that arrive on the fly like Elsa this AM. At this point, the fact that she blames me for her entire childhood
and you were just a bystander may be a deal breaker for her and I. Historically we spoke with one voice. Hell, I think July 5th came to a head because I
was defending you. But it's a big deal that may mean we don't talk again for years. We are quite literally crashing and burning. 
I almost feel like we need a general contractor to host a summit for us. But at a minimum, we need to figure out what we are trying to do here and
how to communicate more sustainably. This is more harm than good.
Here is what I have for today. I hope we just try to touch on issues with a quick Ack and next steps. Then wait for Anna Lisa to tell us when we can
chat about the mental health, safety, and well-being of our kids.   
Running List- You're speaking w/ Anna Lisa, thank you! What's the plan, She's not responsive tbh. 
Adrian- Our most important item yesterday. You won't consider my plan. Can we have a fallback?SAAS- Still stuck in neutral here. We need to have a
bigger discussion on financial commitment. 
Lugg- Are we aligned on day/time/payload? Who is going to set it up? Did I tip them? Use Devon?Dr Brown- Can we fix email? What's scope and
outcome desired? Is she expected to adjudicate?  
Xfinity, ATT, Bofa- I get alerts still, you are the 2x auth on ATT, you get all my stuff for BoFa now
SoberLink- I finally located and put an airtag on it. I also peed and sent that in. Are we good?
Truce- We agreed to try but it feels like you are not in a place to really try this now. Thoughts?
RO- what was the intent and desired outcome? I signed it but nothing appears to have changed. 
--------------------------Cut line?-------------------------------
Elsa- Big bucket. no apology to you? our swinging? no shared responsibility, all me that did this? 
Communication- We agreed to see someone, we did not. Now we can't talk. Can we address?
One Voice- You said kids don't know. Appears you have talked in great detail to them. What's up?Transfers- We are covered right now (agree) but we
need the running list discussion to sync. 
Emails- you do them occasionally. Should I do that too? Are we allowed to CC each other
Bills- what bills are you no longer paying? What should I be picking up that I am unaware of ?
Boys Blink- I shared an apology. You take issue with the explanation. But can you share "sorry"

Boys Xfinity- Should I share YouTube showing how it works?. They promote this, not spying.
Therapist- What should I do to be sure that we get reimbursed? Do I do it or do you, and for who?Job Plans- Shared a thread yesterday. We agree it
would help. Not possible in the status quo.
Beth Check- It's here somewhere in the mess. I'll locate and move to BofA- Xmas gift/Bend trip
Alki- Went down pretty well, pointed out the obvious. Will pay for trash removal. Refund possible.
Spring Break- I think we wait till after Dr Brown to have a realistic discussion about the options.

Hey-
I forwarded you a message on AAU camp for Winter Break in Hotmail, so you have context but am following up here for the discussion. I'd like to
get him back to Shoot 360. I hope it is just like his other basketball activities so does not present an issue. And am even hopeful that Dr Brown
provides an acceptable framework all up. I'd like to at least get him signed up before it fills up.
Here is the relevant info that would apply to him paired down:
MID-WINTER BREAK CAMP
- Advanced Group (6th-HS) : 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- February 20th - February  23rd
- Shoot360, 10842 117th Pl NE
- Kirkland, WA 98033 Camp
- Cost:  Advance Full Week - $225
thanks!

Please don’t do it if you feel like I am controlling you.
And to be clear again, I asked for a team’s call because it seems like it may help. I am not trying to violate our RO and am never going to try and use

I just want to teach you and show you. Just like the kids did at Christina's house for the internet safety course they took. I hate hearing Max and
Adrain are scared when it is something we can fix right away with just a few demos and Q&A.
This is super important because:
1) This creeped the kids out and now I have no way to let them know they are safe.
2) Because this is the singularly biggest thing causing all of the problems in our lives.
We are putting so much time, energy, and money into this, including the cycles through the attorneys. And that seems to have put a halt on all the
things we were trying to wrap up. It has to be worth an hour of our time to be able to put this to bed and put the kids at ease again....
We really can solve this before we even start another week!

No worries. I actually have that issue about 25% of the time on OFW. In general, since this all began, it seems tech has not been our friend

I am open to a mutually agreed protocol for urgent or emergency situations. This was not one. But if there is one, we need a better way to
communicate.
Technically you can unblock me and we know I won’t use it because of the RO. But if AD has an issue at school (example) I could. What would you

Hope you are ok with the investment decisions I’m making. I’ve been very deliberate since July and spend time on this while I am unemployed.
I trimmed back on losers I wanted to see rebound (ARK, AMD). I was being stubborn. I’m focused on stocks I believe are best for the next 6-12
months.
That said, we still have a good chunk of Tesla I’m not comfortable with. It’s not like a real stock. It behaves like a Musk popularity contest. Still tbd
there.
But loser sales have funded bills and should help offset capital gains we see as we transition to selling some of the winners. I think it’s a win-win
though?
I realize penning this, how I miss our intellectual connection. Between that and booty, we eliminated our most electric/satisfying connections. I
digress..
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. I’d be happy to consider input or feedback if you want to consider a more conservative position
right now.

I am starting this in OFW per the RO.
I can do that. But it will be in the form of a polite inquiry. Sort of like I had to do for the Vyvanse so we agree but offer a more immediate remedy.
For the meeting, thanks. I still would far prefer to do this face-to-face. It will be a much better way to build rapport with them and that is important.
If Anna Lisa could approve a Teams call to lock this down asap, that would be super. It's a big deal to me. Please let me know if you disagree.

Hi Christine and Rob,
Hearing that Max and your family are having a great experience at SAAS is wonderful. I am happy to set up a Zoom call for the three of us to discuss
Adrian joining us at SAAS.
In the meantime, I strongly encourage you to complete the Ravenna application for Adrian so the process can start as soon as possible. We cannot
make enrollment decisions without an application, and we will need it regardless of a midyear transfer or entry next year. The sooner the application is
complete, the better.
I am available for a Zoom call next Thursday between 8:00 and 11:30 or Friday between 12:30 and 4:00. Would either work for you?
Thanks

When you respond could you let her know yes will start application in Ravenna, but tell her if she needs immediate details for Adrian we had the
application completed for 6th grade in the fall of 2022 and perhaps they could review that to get a head start. This might remind her directly we did
this for 6th grade already.

First- how do you and I coordinate our thoughts and plans consistent with the true spirit of the RO? You lead, I’ll follow.
Second- let’s jam out the request today. I want to be responsive and timely. Then let’s agree on a time and send a response that captures both in a
single email and also asks if we can do this in person.
WRT the impending divorce, it’s not our friend in this discussion so I’d prefer that we appear to be a happy, well adjusted family. That way it does
not look like ADs issue is really home life, and not ICS.
If that is controversial to you, let’s move to OFW to discuss.

Hey-
I’m trying to figure out how we do this for Max and even me. The Vyvanse is over 1k name brand w/o insurance and around $450 with. I know that
caused a stink before with us.
But I know Max just recently had his Rx filled so I am wondering how we did that because the generic has not been available for sometime and it will
help me decide how I do it too.
And side note, I’m hoping that by coming off your Starbucks insurance as you asked, and moving to something else I don’t have a worse plan where I
have to pick that cost up.
Let me know your thoughts. It’s a big number and between Max and I we could be talking about ~1k-2k a month so while it might seem like a
frivolous ask, I think it’s important to agree on.

So the way I I make sure Max feels safe but welcome is we chat a bit to catch up. And then I will offer something to do together like this "Hey, I know
you probably already have plans, but if they fall through, I'd love to XYZ with you, so just let me know" He always does but at least he knows the
offer is there and I'm thinking of him.
I'd like to do the same for AD this afternoon to shoot some hoops here. It is gorgeous and would be fun. Just so you are aware, he and I have been
having some deep, AD lead conversations- Cabo, Whistler, Hawaii, and Vegas. We have touched them all. He wants me to understand the impact it
has had on him, and know why I did that.
Every time we go there, just like when he has asked me to blow, I am very positive and reassuring. I thank him sincerely for not turning his back on me
and loving me enough to have a difficult conversation that makes him feel uncomfortable. It is a true sign of unconditional love. I appreciate it and
want him to know I'm an open book.
So, with those things noted:
- Gorgeous day to shoot some hoops
- A safe way to bow out of an offer to play
- We are having important conversations
I'd like to see if he wants to shoot hoops for an hour. I take him to practice. You pick him up!
I don't see a down said but appreciate your concerns in advance. I hope you can find a way to let "us work on us" in a safe space (nothing safer and
more comfortable than a game of pig for me and him) in a small-time boxed opportunity until you and I have a longer discussion/explanation.

Adrian deserves an explanation for what he saw. I saw the exact same thing- mom in the garage in the app. And I want to show you how/why. Please
let me.
Let’s not put our head in the sand for another week please. There is nothing wrong with me showing the real world experience so you both

So... As I mentioned, I think it’s unfair to have this conversation without setting the context first.
I have not been able to talk to anyone and have basically been shut out while fear and anxiety has only increased from the cameras to Xfinity and then
to AT&T. And I am begging not educate you.
Then yesterday Elsa weighed in with her side of the story, but she has never even heard from me. So I don’t know how she has commentary on my
side of the story if I’ve never even talked to her.
Not only that, but I never even got to hear what A.D. even said so I can speak to it. That said it turns out that he saw exactly what I saw, but I’ve not
had an opportunity to tell him that and explain.
Then, of course, nobody knows that’I have apologized to you and acknowledged that the cameras were there. And Indefinitely caught an earful for
not saying “I’m sorry” when I already had weeks ago.
So as I have me mentioned and offered several times today I would like to show you everything. I would like to do that as soon as possible. Right now,
we do not have a full accounting of the story.
Can you please work with me on at least that part? It will go a long way. And I don’t think it hurts us to tell Dr. Brown that we actually looked at this
rather than ignored all of the explanation.

The message back from your lawyer was I was aware of blink cameras ( I definitely was not) and had access to account..
Why you would point direction at my car makes no sense.
Explanation of accounts suddenly connecting after years of no connection is unbelievable.
You initially said you saw an alert and not a video of me returning. Story changed after now you know what Adrian saw.
You have not provided credentials to account where you viewed the video.
So an apology with lies is not an apology.
The video versus att and Xfinity’s are two different issues. The text you sent was very creepy.
I’m not going to debate this further.
Dr Brown will help sort out but to be clear my position is you illegally monitored us. That’s why RO and the communication protocols

What is Dr Brown sorting out? We definitely agreed we would work together on what we wanted and how we would go about it. Is that still the plan
or has this moved to unilateral decisions and direction?
On both counts, I am sincerely trying to coordinate and cooperate with you. But I honestly don’t think you are open to anything I say. Can we work
together on our kids issues or are you sole decision maker?

Agree it’s not helpful. I asked for a way we could talk about what we want from Dr. Brown and how we propose to do it. That is after all what we
agreed to.
So you can step away if you like. That makes sense. Because you’re actually not answering my questions. And in fact, you just turned to attacking me
instead.
Your quote below is funny about not responding to asks. Please read any of your responses and let me know a single question of mine you answered.
I actually don’t think there’s any reason to regroup if you are not going to answer any of my questions and instead just insult me and attack me. It’s
not helpful.
Are we working together with Dr. Brown or not? Do I have any say in what we are trying to accomplish with our children or are you the sole decision-
maker?

I did not see a reply. And you stepped away after confirming we would work on this.
It's super frustrating to still be doing this with you after having my place for almost a month now. I know we both agreed to work together this week
because it is taking a toll on everyone but here we are again. Not a single thing accomplished on the move. Zero. And I handled Alki for us.
Ever notice that when I do this, it always gets done? And we even make additional, accommodating trips happen on the fly? I don't get why this is so
hard, and I fully expect you to come back at me next week with more threats of sending my stuff to storage, yet again.
Like a successful marriage, this takes two. Hmmm... is there a pattern?

I'm frustrated and I want to communicate with you. We are getting a divorce because we did not do that. Can we not make our divorce shitty, and
our kid's lives hell for the same reason?
The spirit of my emails is accurate. I won't repeat them. I am frustrated to see us going in circles. But it is not helpful to make passive-aggressive and
cynical comments to make my point.
I want to apologize for my counterproductive tone. I'd like to try and resume working together as we discussed Tuesday. And if I am frustrated by
you, I want to respond better than I did tonight.
One thing I really wish we had done, and will do even now, is follow Dr Brown's instructions to see someone. A professional who can help us
communicate better.  Be kind. We did not, and here we are.
And tbh, I don't want to bother with Dr Brown if we are just going to blow off her advice again. It's just a waste of time and money. Especially if we
plan to still go to meditation in the future.
So I will try harder tomorrow. I hope you do too but it will not make me try less. I hope you can start to try and give a lirttle sometimes as well. But if
you do not, I will still try to do my best.
We should not be going from bad to worse. It's in our and the kid's best interest to both be happy. To appreciate each other, and our history. We
should advocate, not defame each other.
I hope we can break this cycle. This time this summer, you were laughing till you peed your pants. Swapping yummy sides. And heading home with
lust in our eyes and love in our heart. We gotta do better.

I also appreciate the conversation earlier. You are asking all the questions. But some of the details are getting mixed up. I am happy to help explain.
I understand this may be too emotional for you to even entertain however and will respect that as well. I’m just trying to show you what happened,
when.
And to be sure that you know, because I keep saying it but it doesn’t seem to register- I had access, it invaded your privacy, and should’ve informed
you
“Christine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of
your personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry”
I don’t know how to say sorry other than say “I am truly sorry.” I made that clear weeks ago. You wanted it to go through lawyers, so I did that too. I’
m trying.
Either way, I promised to work with you constructively after my tone issue, and I assure you that is a promise I will keep.

So I might have more things but I don’t know when you check in and out so wanted to get this to you now
Sonos... its all over, I really need the closet stuff
Old Alexa stuff if it works
Accent pieces (non sentimental)
Extra baskets?
Old stairway piece
Pillows - throw
Shovels
Saws
May be other stuff
WiFi stuff you are not using. I assure you that the one in your office works. Obviously too well. So please keep that one. That said, it might need to be
re-paired after the password change. Happy to help.
Let’s also agree on the old home automation stuff. There is NOTHING that tracks or monitors AT ALL. But we want to agree on stuff as a team.
Happy to speak to anything I can find. Every light bulb, plug, roomba, came with some freaking app.
Let’s talk about a towel, linen refresh.

I had sent a long email with all items headed over but it didn’t send and is not in drafts. Frustrating.
It’s a small/medium job I think
Items I have so far
Peloton and bike extender to sell, two grills, bedside table, bench for end of bed, bike rack, small portable heater, yeti cooler, suitcase and box with
your momentos, suitcase with grill stuff, small suitcase that was unpacked but had clothes in, a few boxes with grill items from kitchen, box with all
Sonos speakers and Alexa devices from computer closet, Sonos unit from upstairs closet, 2 hanging bags of shirts/clothes with suit, large picture from
Harry Potter closet, I put other WiFi extender in, 4 nice linen baskets that were in guest closet.
I’ll gather some saws and shovels.
I can’t get to pillows as they are behind stack of you bags with clothes. Once I move to garage I’ll look.
I’ll put Alki key in envelope with your mail. I’ll put in box with Sonos items.
I kept your msft w2 so I can do taxes.
Do you want skis, juicer, George Forman grill, tool chest from garage, bags with socks, underwear, sweaters, msft tv shirts, any other bags of clothes,
dresser, other boxes packed from guest bedroom, 2 nice backpacks (tumi and Oakley), anything else?

Ok, thanks.
I am sorry your email went poof. It sucks but you did a great job here. I think we start with what you are sending. I can only digest so much at a time.
Also worried about sending a bunch of stuff that just needs to go back in 8 months. The last conversation we had was me taking over the Kirkland
mortgage.
That said, if it is in your way, of course I want to get it out of your eyesight. But we’re talking about deep into the garage at this point I think. Do you
agree?
Nothing works for the Sonos unless I have the
closet piece.
No worries at all about the pillows. That can be whenever.
What did you think about linen and towels? You suggested we refresh.
I probably need to share other stuff for taxes like my unemployment info.
Hope you are keeping the good extender. I will help when you are ready.
They can only move the heater head. No propane. So it needs to be removed.
Are the socks good or are they the ones we said we would give to Max.
The other clothes I’d like to see before we move them. Still ten bags here.
I would take my backpacks I think. But I owe you luggage back.
Really appreciate the planning. We will get there!

The bags that are in my way are mainly clothes in front room. I had emptied out the closet and dresser drawers so likely workout gear, ski clothes and

So... we definitely discussed. You said that you could make it work. But definitely wanted to move. I offered to see if I could help (when we were on

heard that you want to change your mind. That’s why I have so much heartburn moving every little thing since I’m coming back.
Feel free to send socks
Thanks for Sonos
What are “promo videos”
Sounds good on clothes. I want you to have your space. I am hopeful we’ll find peace and civility at some point (this is neither healthy or sustainable
long term) and then we can work on garage together and I sort what I keep vs. goodwill.

On July 5th, you took everything I had worked with for three decades, almost my entire adult existence away from me. You did this with no warning
and strong and consistent evidence to the contrary. We were partners, lovers, and soulmates. And out of the blue you said we were not. You decided
to abolish ties and abandon your vows to blow up the Moyer’s, and not only leave a man behind, but take his food, water, and curse his existence. The
man who had tried to love, lead, and provide for our crew his whole life.
I was changing. I heard you. I was making improvements to everything I knew was a problem. You saw that. Celebrated that along side me. Told me
that it was the right path, and now we just needed time together. I would like to know what your next big surprise is now. I live in a foxhole waiting
every day for artillery to arrive. Can you please explain your latest secret change of plans and what you are doing next to destroy the man who called

You send questions. Know I get alerts and will respond. Then check out. So you are well aware of what you’re doing.
Dr. Brown was very clear on her suggestion about how we can have more peaceful communications. To make OFW work, her suggestion was to talk
to each other like you were speaking to your boss afraid of losing yourjob.
So trying let’s imagine you and Julie were working on a problem together in real time that meant a physical time commitment from you both today.
You send some q’s and step away for a few hours not telling her you checked out.
Again not being aggressive, but what would she think? How am I supposed to respond? I’m guess my feedback is you are complaining about me
being aggressive, then doing the most passive aggressive thing ever.

Not only do you not stop, you double down. You continue the same disrespectful behavior, and then up it a notch by sending me new questions
repeatedly you expect answered. And this while you ignore mine when I ask for an answer.
All of this while you are out running around making parental decisions that I have not been a part of because you assumed full custody of our kids,

I am eager to work with you, but this seems like a perverse joke, with you two sitting around thinking about how to make me look like a fool next. Just

This is uncalled for. I can’t do this back and forth with you. There has to be a better way.

You don’t hope someday that we can catch each others glance and remember a tender moment, a special date. I know you did not hate me for 30
years, and keep having kids. I know we enjoyed our love making. I also know you saw I was getting better. Changing the man I was to be the man you
asked me to be. I was all in.
So you can have a pov on the bad times. That’s fair. But there is no way you can deny that when you were cold, I kept you warm. When you were
hungry, I fed you. And when you cried, I held you. If after 30 years as soulmates, the best we can do is civil it will be a wasted life.

For below to happen there cannot be the volatility in behavior and pendulum swings.
What you are speaking of below is achievable for individuals who are interacting in a normal manner, consistently.
My interactions with you over the last 7 months have been at many times frightening, scary, volatile. You are asking me to revert back to behavior in
the marriage where I pretend things did not happen, brush it off, act happy, and not hold you accountable. That has stoped. I recognize my feelings
and impact and do not just move on. As I process each scary or volatile interaction in a manner that it deserves, and they continue or escalate, it
compounds and gets worse as there is no recognition that you don’t start back at zero each time. It is still in a deficit that keeps getting worse. This
behavior and reaction from me and family is what you do not recognize, which is holding you firmly accountable each time. It does not reset at zero
like it did in the past.
The past 7 months does not demonstrate that is the path we are on.

I want to thank you for this. It took time, you put thought into it, and it all makes perfect sense to me. I will not justify my reaction to our situation
but I always have held firm that V Little on June 30th would be proud that I was fighting Christine of July 5th. That I would do anything to save our
marriage and keep our family together, fending off anyone who would destroy it. And that’s what I see happening.
That misses the point entirely. I do think she would appreciate me fighting to learn, heal, and have a better, stronger rebirth that puts us on course for
forever. But what I am missing is the way I’m doing it is the entire reason we are here. The thought is noble, the execution is destructive. It’s like a
Chinese finger trap, the harder I fight and struggle, the worse it gets for us both. She would not like that at all.
If I continue the swings, the volatility, the madness, after you made yourself clear tonight in a very thoughtful way, I deserve to never walk down that
path with you. Alternatively, if I show you I listened, like I had listened this spring, and work on myself for the sake of us, I hope it has a better ending.
I realize I have reverted, I thought about it tonight. But I can get back on the right path again. I will show you.
So thank you for the honest feedback. And while it would have been great to hear in June, I do hear it now and I am acknowledging it. I’ll let my
actions do the talking and hope for the best. Both the June 30th and July 5th, Christine’s would want that.
I truly love you, Christine...

I’ll look through the lists we have swapped this AM and try to stack rank things for you. We agree that the front room is pri one so you are functional

But this should help you out so you know the things I would want most and the things that can wait a bit. For example, I would want the pellet grill
over the green egg far and away. The green egg can wait so I will get that list to you before noon,
On my end, I will look at the things that I suggested go back to you and just start a couple boxes. We don’t need to do that today, but perhaps we
swapped them at a basketball practice or something.
I know you will be busy with work today, and it’s a Monday . So I promise not to be unrealistic about response times here, So I will just do my best if
you’re not able to get back to me. There’s nothing life or death going on here that we can’t just course correct.

I honestly think he needs to just rest and key it pass.
I’ll give him some pain reliever.
In regards to the move I’ll prioritize front room that would help my mental state greatly. I sounds like you won’t have space to store many of items. As
much came from dresser drawers perhaps i load up dresser too and you put in the room that has laundry that you said was huge? That way you won’t
be looking at garbage bags for clothes you use infrequently. Just a suggestion.

Thank you again for all the work you did on your end to help us out!!! 
Elsa and I are not in a good place. She went off on me like she did when she blamed you for missing her flight. Including how I (this time) have ruined
her entire life, still look at her phone records, and have always wanted to ruin her.
Not fighting but finding out you two have been working together on the story (including her talking to her "Blink Friends") without hearing anything
from me, yelling I have never apologized when I had, etc.. sets us both up for failure.
If she was going to be involved, it would be better to transparently let her be involved. I don't want to digress at all and want to stay focused, but the
Elsa situation may be lifelong. I don't anticipate participating in her wedding at this stage.

Of course.
I think our goal is just to get back to normal while we can have phone calls tax emails anything. But that’s clearly gonna take some time.
In the meantime, I also noted that we should consider it for more complicated lists where we need to respond in line to each other.
OFW is not built for that. And when I copy paste, the format goes to hell. We should also consider non-narrative list emails that help us.
Obviously not at this time, but we can take smart baby steps to normalcy. And if I continue to head your advice, I’m confident we will get there.

Thanks. Much appreciated. Awesome!!
I am in a rental for 8 months. So essentially short term storage. The more we move to short term storage with an expiry date in Sept. the worse my life
becomes. If I end up in our home or not.
Given I might very well be moving back into the house as planned. Let’s hold on clearing everything out. You might end up there as well, but I’d
prefer we err on the side of the last outcome we discussed.
That does not mean we can’t still sell stuff. Or even Swedish clean if you and I can learn to play nicely again. But I have two full rooms of unpacked
boxes and if Max wants to visit ever has lost his bedroom.
I am finding more things that can go back, so I’ll wait till we get to critical mass and we can bring them.
You gave some Xmas presents back so I assume you don’t want them anymore. Just gadgety stuff.
Very expensive watches (Mavado) were almost lost. Do I have other valuables that I can look out for? They were with an empty bottle of talcom
powder I tossed into the can till I heard the “thug” in the trash. Any way to tell the junk from my most expensive possessions?

Message 1139 of 4024
Good Morning,
I have your revised RO. Thank you for getting Anna Lisa to send. Two questions on the terms that I hope that you and I can discuss more cost-
effectively than the lawyers.  
WRT - [x] Credible Threat: The Restrained Person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the Protected Person.
Yesterday you told the court I had committed domestic violence. Today you are asking me to sign something that says I am a physical threat to you
and the kids. My hands have been there to tie shoes, wipe tears, hold ice packs, make love, walk hand in hand, morning hugs, and make love. That is all
they are for with you and the boys.
That is what you have seen and I hope you know is true this morning. Do we need to say you believe that I will beat you and my children? I can't
imagine in the deepest depths of my despair over our dissolution I would seek you out and physically harm you or our boys. Must you say that you
believe this to be untrue and you think I will beat you all?
WRT - The parties may also communicate via email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or
managing the parties’ shared assets.
Thanks again for this. Very helpful. But as I have noted on many occasions that OFW is a terrible platform for much of our communications. It is
better as a single subject, single reply, 124 characters, non-copy paste, short burst text tool. Most of the time we communicate on emails we have
several things we are trying to resolve in somewhat complex multi-point situations.
And more often than not, we actually do not want to conduct our "sausage-making" in front of the diner who will eat it. But your offer proposes that
they always have to be present on the thread, we can't drop them, resolve, and add them back. Can you please reconsider?
Thanks again for your efforts to partner constructively in a positive way. Given this is a timely conversation and Lisa is waiting on my direction, it
would be great if we could resolve ASAP.
best
robert

I'll try to do this in OFW first since you are busy. You are going to have to grant me some leeway here as it is a one-sided discussion without you in
real-time. I am trying my best, Christine. 
Question One: Was the RO filed yesterday?
- No. The new RO was sent over yesterday. The court document that was filed was titled: "CONFIRMATION OF ISSUES/REFERRAL TO
FAMILY COURT SERVICES"
- Here is what you filed for the court saying there is domestic violence: "Has either party alleged (said) that domestic violence is an issue in this case?"  
YES  NO
Question Two: Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or emails and texts as it is
demonstrated they have been ugly, tone is confrontational, scary etc. nothing in recent history demonstrates that will change. I am open to your
suggestion.
Below is what Anna Lisa proposed:

"The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted herein. The parties may
communicate via the Our Family Wizard application, and the Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely for the purpose
of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding the management of shared assets. The parties may also communicate via
email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.
Below is what I would like to propose:
- Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to
communicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward
communications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.
- Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children
and/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted for in-depth,
multi-topic communications and or "FYI notifications", without the mandatory inclusion of a third party. This is under the condition that both
parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone. If a communication is deemed potentially contentious, a mutually agreed upon third
party may be included at the discretion of either party for oversight, with prior written agreement.
- Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed
urgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior written agreement in the Our Family Wizard platform or a related email.
This is under the condition that both parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone.
- Additional Conditions: Should either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to
review and potential revision to ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.
I think this sets us up for longer-term success (important, so we are not doing this every two weeks as we grow as co-parents) but also still allows for
the opportunity to re-visit if one of us starts behaving badly... It is optimistic but the best of both worlds with a built-in "out".
Thanks in advance for your thoughtful consideration. (Doing this email in OFW sucked btw )

he definitely has not been 9 for a couple of years....

- I sent the suggestions you requested in the RO. The other is already filed. We should update.
- We are getting close to the Dr Brown date, and I'd still like to collaborate on that with you.
Please note the additional details for each in the appropriate OFW threads or eMails sent.
This stuff is stressful as hell, like watching paint dry, and creates unnecessary anxiety and stress.
I'd like to progress on these items ASAP so we can quit the back and forth. Just let me know.
But after discussing for a while now, I don't think have any way to do a running list discussion.

I think you know the issues, and it sounds like we need two corrections, and chat before we need a 3rd... lol
I really hope you and I get to the stage where we take the reins back. Just fixing this stuff will cost a few K.
I'll be leaving in about an hour. I'll see if you had time to check-in. If not, I'll work around your schedule!
We both want to address these, so I assure you I am not going to harass you. Take your time and take care!

Hey, I had to finally go to Nordstrom’s today and buy some new jeans. It was like $700 so I wanted to get it on your radar. I also got AD his
replacement jacket.
When I got home, I realized that all my baggy ones were 32s that I got a couple months ago. Since the new ones are 31s, I might just go back and get
30s.
I’m trying to be smart about it but I haven’t been this size since junior high. I keep thinking it will stop and it’s safe to buy but I just keep getting
thinner.
I’ll keep looking on eBay too.
Why couldn’t I look this good when we were married?

Hey- You're super busy so let me do the sausage-making to make this super simple, teammate! Below are the issues that will cost us a fortune and not
be resolved till spring if we don't step in. It is long but is all-inclusive, so please take a moment to digest. Ready to move when you are.
I) Confirmation of Issues:
    - You filed a court doc that says I am "a credible threat to the family's physical safety". We agree that I'm not beating you, or our boys
    - Your suggestion was: "Let Lisa know and respond accordingly requesting to remove. I’ll connect with Anna Lisa on that box checked."
II) Temporary Restraining Order:
    - An update was filed with no material improvements- still no running list, 1-1 sausage-making emails, emergency/urgent calls or texts.
    - Your suggestion was: "Can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate? I’m concerned... but open to your suggestion."
--------------------------------------Suggested eMail from Lisa to Anna Lisa--------------------------------------
Hi Anna Lisa- intro and niceties..
After some follow-up discussions between Ms Moyer and Mr Moyer, they have arrived at the following mutually agreeable modifications to the
Confirmation of Issues filing and the Temporary Restraining order to better meet their needs at this time. They both appreciate the mutual
teamwork and goodwill in a difficult time.
I) Confirmation of Issues: They both agree on the following updates to the court filing
    - They would like to change Adrian Rex Moyer's age from 9 years old as noted, to 11 years old.
    - Ms Moyer agrees Mr Moyer is not presently a credible threat to the family's physical safety
II) Temporary Restraining Order: They would like the following accommodations to the plan filed
    - Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to

communicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward
communications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.
    - Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children
and/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted 1-1 for in-depth,
multi-topic communications and or "FYI notifications". If necessary, a mutually agreed upon 3rd party may also be included with prior written
agreement.
    - Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed
urgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior agreement in Our Family Wizard.
    - Additional Conditions: All communications are subject to the condition that both parties maintain a respectful and constructive tone. Should
either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to review and potential revision to
ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.
Sincerely,

So.. yes. Please keep any required documentation that you will need for taxes.
For stock sales, I have tried to be smart about our sales. This includes selling long-term stocks if MSFT or Moyer, as well as cleaning out some losers
that won't hit our bill and might even offset some gains. So, my hope is I managed my end well and you will manage your end well.
We have always been super at this together, so I want to enjoy our "secret weapon for wealth-making" as long as I can. Amy way we can get a divorce

For Dr Brown, we will need to align here.

My goal is to update of situation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will

It's unfortunate we still have to try and solve complex muti-topic issues this way post a new RO.
Hope to make my point constructively here. But I will be honest and forthcoming and hope you see this as a constructive response and not a
personal attack.
An RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified. I am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any
violation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I would hope you received same guidance. 
<<You have been saying that the RO was filed for a couple of weeks. But we did what we needed to do to advance our issues. Now you won't and
have a sudden change of heart. You were going to work with Anna Lisa to modify the RO so we could be more effective, especially acknowledging the
need for our "Running List" format. None of that happened. We are not much better off today than two weeks ago. And even after trying to resolve it
at your request yesterday with haste, the "no upgrade" RO was filed.
Today- zero progress, nothing in sight. I realize this is not business, but know you are far more capable than this. If you were 90% blocked from
effectively doing your job, had been saying you would fix it for two weeks, came back and told Julie you didn't fix anything, you are still blocked but
will keep at it with no timeline or schedule even with all the help you can get, I don't see that flying tbh. I will be patient as I promised, but you
brought it up so just replying. >>

<<We do need to align. The only context she has to define her plan of action is your email. That's it. She has no idea who and why to involve in the
discussion and why? I would like to align, as I have mentioned from day one. Not just today, but every single day since this started. Only responding
to the 10th request a day or two before we do this is not grounds for saying "well it's too late, let's go with it." Further, this was about AD and I. That
is it. We both saw it and were never given a chance to discuss or explain.
So now we need to discuss reunification as a result and if we handle the situation in a way, healthiest for him. And what we should do in the future. It
is appropriate for those impacted by what AD saw- AD, Me, you, to have that conversation. No one else. This is not about relitigating something I
apologized for, and as you say, we both disagree on. Dr Brown should not be making that judgment. She is not qualified>>
A shared proposal I hope we can both get behind and work as a team:
- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.  
- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
we handled it. 
- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns. . 
- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting
plan if necessary.

[ This bracket denotes your thoughtful feedback ]
<< This bracket is my comments in return>>
 -----------------------------------------------------
Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.
[ I will add this will impact the parenting plan as it impacted me greatly, on how I navigate these situations, and how you and I communicate. This
raised a level of fear for me, trauma and trust. ]
<<I agree with you, and I think we leave it up to her on the parenting plan. That is why we are going. It is not a goal, however. This point should
come out in the discussion. We have competing perspectives, and that is what we are trying to navigate. Not just your scenario where you are 100%
right. Our goal is peaceful and constructive communication through conflict and disagreement in order to be a better parenting team. >>
- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
we handled it.
[I believe Elsa has a perspective to share. Dr. Brown actually thought it would be helpful to discuss with her last time, but I did not push it.]
<<This incident did not happen last time. If we want Elsa to discuss a parenting plan, we choose the appropriate time and place not squeeze her into
this agenda. It was clear in our argument she had limited 2nd hand info on what happened driving her conclusions. I trust Elsa 100% when she has all
the right data, but she does not. I also saw this when she attacked me for our swinging days and the relationship you had with Kevin. Limited data,
bad conclusions>>
- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns. .
<<Agree>>
- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting
plan if necessary.
<<Agree>>
- How We Use: I'd like to agree here. Last time we paid for advice not adopted. For that matter, if we don't follow her advice, I'm not totally sure why
we are going back.
[We did adopt most aspects of it. I disagreed with the overnight on Wednesday.]
<<What we did and did not agree to last time is an unproductive rabbit hole. What are we going to use her advice for this time? Is it just another

accountable and allows us to course correct (just like now) Love to have Elsa go next time in a more general family update. I don't see a downside to

When you do, would you mind sharing our thoughts? It would be better to present our teamwork and cooperation rather than coming across as
uncooperative and uncoordinated. 
Also, I don’t think the RO applies to you if you ever need me quickly. So just feel free to ring me or text me. I would hate to keep you waiting on an
answer from me. Then just block me again afterwords.
Do you want me to take a!pass at the sass update?  As mentioned I’m not terribly familiar with his ICS experience, but I’ll be happy to take a go at it..
I think the fine line to walk is being respectful and appreciative, but at the same time, acknowledging the fact that he does not like it and wants to

Dr Brown- We are less than 24 hours away. Given response and turnaround times it might as well be in the next 15 minutes. Can we get that to her?
AD Questionnaire- I am going to stop errands and focus on finishing that with ICS so I can get it back to you with time for Lori to review if she likes.
SAAS meeting- Let's appear as healthy and well-adjusted as possible. We can do it here, but I need time to tidy. Obviolhs on best behavior.  Please
confirm.
Court Filing- Hope we can do this soon. I am in a very uncomfortable state given this is in a live court filing. But I promised patience and will be.
Restraining Order- Hope we can do this soon. Things that could take 5-10 min. take 5-10 hrs. We always have to scramble. But I promised patience

Since the RO says Kirland is a No No, we can do it here. I'll have things tested ahead of time and ask her for the link today. I'll dress casually but nice.

Just some feedback, but some of this whole move thing is just mean. We don't have any idea who will end up where. Based on the last agreement we
had, I was going to be in the house- after I even offered to try and keep you there, but you refused.
And so much of this is junk. Stuff we should have done together when we both left the house. Now it fills three rooms, including the bedroom I had
hoped to make special for Max. That was super important to me. And now I can't even do that.
And then, some of the special things. Things that mean a lot to me are broken or f'd
- The "Microsoft" clay sculpture Elsa gave me 20 years ago
- The Allen field house floor I laid Adrian on when he was born
- Poppa's bible is all taken apart so I'll never know how he had it
- I can go on but won't
And then there are things I *thought* were us. Special things that I hoped we would wait to divvy up. It's all just thrown like trash in a bag.
We are trying to be kinder and accepting, and that's the most important thing now. But I needed to say something because this feels so rude.

- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
I realize we were discussing the value of Elsa with her limited information and non-participation in this but we were still going back and forth. We set
a time to work on it and you bailed.
I am happy to repeat my concerns again if I need to, but I offered an alternative plan. And at the end of the day, the Participants list that came FROM
YOU did not include Elsa. Period.
So while we might have been misaligned, I went with what you said. You can say "not cool" but I asked repeatedly if we were aligned so this DID
NOT happen. Blaming me is "not cool"

Happy to chat more, but for now I will remain positive and constructive as promised. I did nothing in my mind that was either nefarious or meant ill-

She does have a perspective. Based on a non-witness, non parent, and limited information. Remember she screamed at me for never apologizing to
you. I sent my apology three weeks ago. Is she qualified to give her opinion when she has no idea what the heck is going on?
I'll note that she also laid into me about screwing other women when we were married. She has no idea that started when you were 18 in Hong Kong,
we both participated and enjoyed it, but she only knows your side. Then there is her take on Kevin Otero and what you two did together.
I trust Elsa to make smart decisions and contribute constructively. She just needs the full and accurate picture. Otherwise, she will jump to incorrect
conclusions and be very opinionated. That feels like a commonsense requirement to provide testimony. How else would she be helpful?

Don't you ever want to try and get this back on the rails or did she convince you that is the wrong path for the mental health and wellbeing of our

Why would the wrong RO be filed? Why would you send over something for me to sign that tonight you are saying in the only edits you will make?
We talked all week about the other things we need. You asked me to share, so we could have running list, or important one on one detailed emails.
If you were going to file the right, RO, please, let’s consider the list that I sent. If you disagree with any of them or don’t think that they will make
problem-solving easier, please let me know.
This is all with the best intentions in mind Christine so we can work better together. I promise you, I’m not gonna fuck this up. Just like I said all
week, I’m all in.
I guess I just don’t understand why you’re going back on everything you said ????

All week, every day, you asked me to help out and offer suggestions, give you guidance on what will make things better for us, whether it was the
SAAS application, the RO, the court order, or the Dr. Brown engagement.
You also gave me your expectations for a return to normalcy. I thanked you, complied and I’ve really enjoyed working as a team. you also asked me to
show patience, assuring me that you would get back shortly to resolve.
For some reason that all blew up tonight. It feels like Annalisa is the puppet master. She did not even file the right RO that was discussed with Lisa. It’
s super frustrating.to have her as the go between. WTF?

I want to be able to take you at your word and understand when we are working together. Not have the rug pulled out from under me at the last
minute with no discussion at all (as promised)
I’m trying to say this in the most peaceful way, consistent with what we agreed to. But it’s very frustrating, Christine. Please don’t teach a bad lesson
about trust and patience.
This definitely won’t be the road back to any kind of normalcy. Let me know what you think. I am still going to cling to the hope that we can do this.
Please exercise some control here.
Thanks 
Message 1243 of 4024
I am in control Robert.
What I am slowly learning is to see things for how they really have been, and how what you pushed as normal behavior and how I was treated, your
actions, was so wildly inappropriate.
The continued attempts to manipulate and control me, by shaming me, or stating things as fact when they are grossly untrue, its just shocking.
The e-mail about Elsa, and attempts to portray your numerous infidelities as something that I endorsed or condoned....
So the correct RO will be filed, and I will not let you to continue to shame, humiliate me, control or manipulate me into doing what you want.

narrative. So you will ignore it.
And if you are in control, why was the wrong RO filed?
You did that? So now we have actually been violating it on both sides all week. We can’t even do an “fyi” forward. We both broke the RO now. Zero
1-1’s
And why are you offering up something I have already signed. How does that make any sense. I already signed it. Thats being in control?
And you have zero idea about the discussion with Elsa. You have no clue what she said. About our swinging or what she told me about you and
Kevin.
I’m going to stop. I promised to be helpful, not attack even in the face of accusations and insults. I am really trying, Christine. I’m not going to stop.
Please consider I listened to you. I don’t know why you started hating on me tonight, all I know is you spoke with the person who can’t file the right
RO.
Can we please go back to working towards a common goal and quit trying so hard to destroy me? I honestly loved you more than life itself. And I’m
trying.
Message 1246 of 4024
You know I went back and read what I’ve been saying to you over the last few days. I looked at my tone. I looked at my cooperation, and I looked to

I honestly hope you will take a moment and just review some of the things that I was trying to do. I hope that you’ll step back and look objectively at
our communications.
I know you see me as some sort of evil villain, but I’m not, I don’t know why you interpret everything I do is some plot to abuse you. that is not my
intent at all in this relationship
I’m honestly and sincerely trying to listen to you while you are still my wife and be the man you are telling me I need to be for you. I’m doing this for
our children and our mental health.
I’ve been saying since July, just tell me what I did wrong. You don’t have to hate me so much, Christine I am not doing anything with malice or hate
towards you. Please see our threads.
I’m at a loss now on how to behave or what you want from me. It feels like nothing I do is right, no matter how hard I try. I don’t know why you can’

When it needed your updates, I did the same. I wanted to show you we could do something good together.
Please don’t find a reason not to do it.
Please provide a reason for us to partner.
It could make all the difference someday.
Message 1252 of 4024
I truly appreciate the speed and attention you made to the responses and questions. I input into the system as it was first requirement for the
preliminary application but I have been unable to submit it. I’m going to ask why on the call.
I hope you have seen me move forward in the other front for teacher evaluation and transcripts with similar urgency.
Agree that when we do partner together it can result in real synergies.
My hesitation is based on years of lived experience that I am only just unpacking. Anytime I would show or demonstrate a willingness to forgive,
move on, forget etc, it is rewarded briefly (days, weeks, sometimes months) with improved situation, but things have inevitably fallen back to
behaviors that have been traumatizing, scary, disrespectful etc. often times my accepting behavior is then weaponized against me in the most
humiliating or embarrassing way, to demonstrate my weakness or lack of judgment.
I fully expect this to happen in our mediation and future interactions, so I am in a position that I can’t respond in ways I used to. It does not serve me
well.
I don’t expect you to understand but that’s my explanation whether you accept or agree with it.

I just got it. Since it is not filed, can we at least make some basic changes? Even the stuff we are doing on email now is not allowed.
Someone always has to be on the mail for you and I to swap them. So we can’t just share basic information about our own kids.
And honestly, it would be better if we could have a running list format. We can start with something very small but effective.
It’s not going to get filed today anyway, so can we please consider it? It’s gonna cost a lot more money to make it right in the future.

April 15th - if we estimate 24% of 215K = 52K at a minimum.

Please stop sending all the family memories. I keep asking, you say sorry. And then another box lands. Please stop... I’m hoping at some point our
whole life is not devoid of any memories together. It will be a shame to teach the kids that.
And thank you for the original blink cameras . As mentioned, we bought the black Blink cameras for the outdoors, the white Blink cameras for the
indoors, and then I gave you the ring camera as a Christmas present. You have now found all the cameras we bought years ago now. This is what I
said.
I admitted I swapped them before this mess. You clearly put the old ones away, so knew we had them. The new ones were in plain view, never hidden.
And in the same place. May we please step back and consider you might have known about them? You put them away with your own hands.
Please see attached. There is one, that went above the door. It still has the same mount on it that was used to put it in the same holes that the Comcast
cams used. The other has no mount. It was never mounted. It sat pointing at the door as a deterrent. You sent what I said we had for years.
I am not looking to start an argument, or re-litigate. I am simply pointing out that this is my exact explanation. And if you did not know about them,
that’s fine. But note you put them in bags and put them away. And now you sent them back to me.
If this doesn’t make sense, I’m happy to explain. But you get the point. We bought them years ago. You packed them away. And here they are. I have
not been lying. They are on my coffee table now. Please consider my explanation again given this.

I can certainly try and find more info. Of course! I’m happy to try and figure that out. But I admit that I did the swap. That is not even a debate. I did
that.
I thought where we were hung up was the idea that the originals never exist existed, and you did not know. But here they are. And you put them
away.
I really don’t want to fight. I will look. But they did exist. And whether you remember or not, you did at some point come into physical contact with
them.
So that part of the entire story (and Elsa laying into me about them not existing) doesn’t appear to be accurate. We have to acknowledge at least that.
The other thing we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt is- they DONT work in the garage. It’s not possible. No need to debate it. We can see.
I can also show you that if you go out of WiFi, they stop. Come back in they connect, just like your laptop does. No intervention is needed. It’s called
“retry”
We don’t need to debate. It is all provable. We could do it tonight. I should have said something that night. I know that. I’m sorry. But I was not

I’ll remind you that you are considered to be ambitious, driven, and willing to take on challenges. You are a natural leader, charismatic, and self-
confident. Dragons are thought to be lucky individuals who are passionate, decisive, and do things in a grand manner. You are also perceived as being
intelligent, enthusiastic, and have a strong sense of independence.
Sounds about right to me! Wishing you prosperity and wealth. Have a great day kicking off your year!

Your Ask:
Robert (cc'd) and I are aligned that it would be very helpful to engage your assistance in navigating this sensitive area involving surveillance activities
and monitoring. Robert and I have a different perspective on what unfolded and can share in our discussions. Our lawyers are also aligned with this
proposed approach on how we might address this issue in relation to the parenting plan. Our proposal would be to schedule a conversation with our
youngest son Adrian to share his experience and impact to him, potentially our oldest daughter Elsa, myself and Robert.
Our Ask:
- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.
- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
way we handled it.
- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our
parenting plan if necessary.
- How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being
formally approved. So TBD.
Dr Brown did not seem to do this at all. In any way. Either one of our asks above. I assume this was not a bait and switch, but the intent was clearly to
address Adrian's reaction to the cam incident and how we reunify safely and healthily.
So now I guess we will never address the cam, how we handled it, and when I can see our son. Given this was your idea, I want to work with you since

none of our intentions were met. What do you suggest next. This is all so beyond fucked to me.

know they need to be addressed. But I can't do that if I can't address them. What would you like?
This is absolutely not the engagement described, requested, or signed up for.

Adrian shared what he witnessed with Dr. Brown, impact and as I understand what he feels needs to happen to earn trust etc.
She is scheduling time with you and I separately but indicated that surveillance activities are highly concerning and meet the threshold for DV.
I know you are contesting the surveillance but understanding consequences and long term impact are something I am uncertain you have fully
comprehended.

This OFW thing is fine for settled business. When you need to swap pick up plans. What we are trying to do right now is way bigger, and will have a

Please consider a one time peaceful discussion. I’d be happy to go for a walk, do teams, or phone call. I know we have things we need to work around,
but we could do the Bellevue park circle or a place of your choosing. Whatever works.
But we are kidding ourselves that this format will do us any justice at all. We know it does not work. Let’s try something that has for us in the past.
Hell. I even sold and bought a house in one day after one of our more contentious walks!
In my mind we really are not far apart. Mainly because I’m willing to do whatever you like to feel comfortable. I’m honestly open to ideas and trust
“most” of your judgement. We have been through the wringer. Let’s compromise.
Let’s take this back. I showed last week I’m done fighting. Let’s start putting our energy into healthy kids, your job, and my job search. We really don’t
need to wake up to ground hog day with every sunrise. I am dying for normalcy.
You said you’d consider it. Let’s do it. I know you well enough to believe in you. And I just need a shot to show you who I am now. What we’re doing
is not working. The kids need healthy parents. Let’s just do it. If we miss failure, we can always do this again.

He asked if he can come over to watch the Super Bowl tomorrow. He is dying to see the house he chose, furnished. Both the boys are pleasers so he
wants me to ask you. I think he is concerned about doing something he feels like may disappoint you.
Given that he wants it. Dr Brown will not offer an opinion, and there is no harm that will come from it, would you mind asking him like you did for
the Alabama game? I trust that you will do it in a way that makes him feel comfortable. I trust you completely.
Given zero help from Dr Brown except for her helpful insight for me. That I will take to heart and find healthy moments to explore his concerns, I
think we are kind of now at a point where you and I need to decide. And possession is 9/10 of the law.
So I’d like to have him over. The alternative is pick some random date in the next few weeks when nothing has changed. It will be like all of last month
all over again for us. Or we wait weeks/months to try and do something big and formal like for Max.

Thanked them for being kind. Told them it’s ok to feel mad at me and let them know that now I understand, so I’ll step away. When they feel
comfortable I will be here. I am their dad, and I’m always there for them.
So with that, I assume there is no longer a need for a parenting plan. If I’m fighting so hard to see them but they don’t want to see me, it doesn’t make
any sense. I can’t force them to love me, so I’m going to stop.
I assume that will end 90% of our fights and give you what you want (and actually have already taken) I hope I did that in a healthy way. Everything
changed when you said AD doesn’t want to be with me.
Please let me know if you need anything and same as for the boys, I’ll be there for you. I understand why you all hate me now, so I’ll stop being your
burden. You are all free. No more Dad! I wish you the best.

Hey!
Hope you are having a good day and starting the week on your front foot. Just wanted to touch base given a long list of things (mostly kid related
topics) that I would like to touch base on with you.
I shared several related emails over the weekend that went unanswered. You might be too busy or are just choosing not to reply. That is honestly none
of my business. But I did comply with the OFW ask.
So, in the spirt of healthy cooperation I’ll send one more to see if you would like to - continue using OFW despite it not working, arrange for a way to
peacefully communicate, or move to expensive lawyers.
I am trying hard to recognize your concerns and anticipate a response of “it’s too much to even reply”. But I am using OFW as asked, and when you
don’t reply, I agree. It’s a lot, now we are backed up.
I’m also disappointed that we keep adopting the guidelines you and Anna Lisa dictate, and since October our relationship and co-parenting has

I know what’s in it for Anna Lisa, but you’re the mother of our family. And despite how this is positioning your mediation strategy, imho, we are
doing life long damage to the kids and frankly you.
I anticipate a response that it’s all my fault. That’s fine. It is. Our entire marriage was my fault, the kids are my fault, and we never had a nice day in 29
wasted years. But I still want to unwind our disaster peacefully.
So.... I’m asking in a hopeful way in the spirt of healthy co-parents, how we communicate moving forward. The prescribed method isn’t  working and
gets worse every day as asks go ignored.
Thanks!

Thank you for the prompt and kind reply.
I can start list and share beforehand. My concern is for some of these things we could spend 20 minutes talking to reach an agreement or a week going
back and forth here. For each of ~five issues?
It’s not meant to be a criticism but a simple acknowledgement that when four hours pass before you can afford a reply, an exchange that should take
5-10 minutes usually takes more than 5-10 hours.
My hope is we can:
- Start with a list here (OFW)
- Both share our thoughts (email?)
- Agree to discuss peacefully (tbd?)
- Peacefully agree/disagree
- Document our decisions (OFW)
- Expedite our existing backlog
If we can agree, I will start the list today. We can swap our first thoughts (it would be far easier in email for inline comments?). And then have our 1-1
meeting together on Wednesday evening.

Of course. I want to do the right thing and so do you. I am happy to start the list here as asked.
Here is what the RO says now:
- The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as
specifically permitted, below:
- The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard
solely for the purpose of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding
management of shared assets.
- The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in
communications with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or
managing the parties’ shared assets.
As I read this, you have no restrictions on communicating with me. The RO just limits how I contact you.  It also does not prohibit face-to-face
interactions- school events, sports, or a constructive discussion walk or coffee.
Do you read the text above the same way? I just want to be sure we are on the same page before I spend a considerable amount of time documenting
everything with the expectation that we will resolve anything on OFW again.
My fear is that will lead to the same frustration that inspired this ask. My hope is you will exercise your rights so we can work together instead of going
in a circle by kicking off another round of what has always failed as noted below.
I will start the list and share it here. May I also ask you let me know if you will consider my proposal for a one-time, peaceful and constructive all-up

Totally... any chance we can do that today? Respectfully, of course, this discussion has been going on for weeks  and I'd like to start an inline
discussion tomorrow. I assure you I am NOT coming off the rails. Last week's ask of me is the way I plan to live my life from now on.
Just as an FYI below. It should be a pretty simple, straightforward turnaround for Anna Lisa.
The language provided in the restraining order (RO) specifically addresses restrictions on the "Restrained Person" regarding communication with the
"Protected Person." The terms of a restraining order are directed at the behavior of the restrained person to protect the safety and well-being of the
protected person. It does not impose reciprocal restrictions on the protected person's actions unless specified by the court in a mutual restraining
order.
Here’s how the outlined conditions generally apply:
1. **Restrictions on the Restrained Person**: The detailed conditions explicitly limit how the restrained person can communicate with the protected
person. These limitations are in place to prevent unwanted or potentially harmful interactions, while still allowing necessary communication for co-
parenting or managing shared assets through specified channels.
2. **Lack of Mention of Restrictions on the Protected Person**: The text does not mention any restrictions on the protected person’s behavior. This
is consistent with the purpose of a restraining order, which is to protect one party from the actions of another. However, the protected person is
typically not prevented from contacting the restrained person unless they also have a restraining order against them or there are specific court orders
to that effect.
If both parties need or want to modify the communication terms of the RO—for example, to allow more flexibility or to impose certain restrictions
on the protected person as well—it's essential to do so through the court. Any changes to the terms of a restraining order must be approved by a judge
to be legally enforceable.
In any situation involving a restraining order, consulting with a legal professional can provide guidance tailored to the specifics of the case, including
any questions about communication rights and restrictions for both parties.

Time & Date in screenshot
Side note... I hope this doesn’t push buttons because it should put you ease. Obviously ADs screen time is more intrusive than the things we had set
up for us.
We had simple things like “joined the network” for anyone (Elsa, Christina, Ms Stephanie... etc) and it never said anyone’s name in the actual alert.
BUT if you drilled into it you could kinda figure it out by looking at the device name- “Ms. Stephanie’ iPhone” and triangulating on the time it fired.
This (when we were a family) was important. You want to know if people are on your family’s network. They can do bad things to work laptops, kids
stuff, etc...
When I was in the fold, I tried hard to keep us all safe. Just like you file our taxes. We did what we know how to do as in an effort to keep the Moyer’s
humming.
BUT!!! The big takeaway for you, is there were NEVER indoor cams. This hint is enough to infer things. So please know your privacy was NEVER
invaded.
I will swear that’s true on my children’s life, Christine.
I don’t want to hurt you. I still love you more than life.

It’s not a number. That’s either an sms or mms. This is an iOS alert. Just like with the “you know what”incident. Xfinity brokers that handshake with
Apple.
It has nothing to do with ATT. Neither did the other. And it is frustrating. Apple iOS sees a trigger in the cloud and pumps it out to my MAC
address.
Stuff happens in the service and even I don’t always grok the trigger. But in both cases, we know what made those fire. We just don’t know how to
stop it.
It’s not going to kill us as long as I don’t go to jail or loose future employability for it. So as long as we agree I can even stop putting myself in danger.
Just let me know. This is obviously one of the running list items I realized should go through Lisa, but felt like you and I could potentially just
cooperate on.
I want to get back to a place of trust with you. But till then, with Anna Lisa in play, it’s very scary to me. I’ll follow your lead, Christine and hope for

Sorry... I could have been more helpful but did not want to ruin a positive conversation with you.
Now that you have taken the reigns of the Network, however, you see all the stuff I used to see.  It is not intentional, you don't always understand it,
but unwelcome alerts pop up on your phone. I know, it happened to me all the freaking time.
The good news is that Samsung is likely a TV that was out of Wi-Fi range and conditions changed (a door that is usually closed is left open) or it has
not been turned on in a long while (maybe the TV in the man cave?). Then it reconnects, then you get an alert.
The good news is to join the network, it had to have a password at some point. And maybe this was just a TV that has not been joined since you
changed the WiFI name? That can happen. So it's annoying for sure, but probably safe, and not nefarious.
So as mentioned, if you let me know next time, I can teach you how to open an alert, investigate what it is, and have some peace of mind that it should
be there. Some android devices are no help, but Samsung usually has the metadata you need.
Alternatively, perhaps I can screen record simulating the same situation on my phone and share it with you. A picture is worth a thousand words, so a
video is probably worth a book. Divorce is the worst time to have this kind of alert crap happening.

This helps us out by:
- Allowing you to inspect where the boys may eventually spend the night
- Letting you mock and criticize my taste in my "man decor" furnishings
- Permitting me to cook for someone for the first time in six long months
- Gives us time to actually have potentially game-changing conversations
- Providing an environment more personal, where body language matters
- Giving you an out to walk away if I ever, in any way make you uncomfortable
- Perhaps kindling a blueprint for the way the kids could see us in the future

I hope that the offer still stands. AND I hope I have shown a trend toward cooperation and peace, communicating in a way that puts you at ease. My
suggested updates to the RO are still valid and will afford us to be much more effective than the current way (which has me re-sending this mail from
ten days back). I hope you can see that.
So appreciate the continued partnership here. It is so much nicer than living in a bomb shelter. Just let me know if we are going to follow through on
the suggestions you requested of me, and we can ask for an update and be done with this mess! 
Hope your day is going well....

My days of fucking around in OFW to make things readable are over....  It takes so much time when we could just send a simple formatted email.
But that is also noted below... lol.
Looking forward to fleshing this out but you need to tell me how and where. Thanks for the cooperation this week. Except the "post-Anna Lisa"
moment last Friday when everything took a 180 turn, , we are over ten days of actually working together!
There is light at the end of the tunnel!!! (unless it's actually a train with Anna Lisa on the side... lol )
Joking aside, I hope we have turned a corner. I'd like to consider this weekend for my suggested detente. Each day we put this off, it just gets worse.
And if we don't try, we will never be able to demonstrate that we can do this... it's our catch-22. So let's just answer it once and for all.

I have mentioned we are out of Fernish coverage area. So I planned to go get a Cost-Plus world market table. But when I got my Starbucks, this AM I
thought i had nothing to lose by going into the Bellevue Consignment store. Wham!!! Jackpot! This table is so much better than what I was looking at
cost plus. It is a huge store and I think you might be able to find stuff for the cat room there. Plus, they have a very reasonable delivery service, or you
can use Devan? It's worth a look since it is SO much easier the Craigslist. I'm going to start there from now on.

Message 1373 of 4024
So it might be time to step back from this. It is not working. I appreciate the civility we have shared over the last ten days, but the reality is we are not
one task closer to solving anything. And you don't reach out with the smallest olive branch to communicate with me, even with the last
obstacle cleared by Anna Lisa. I don't anticipate any change. It is an established pattern, and I was misguided to think you might find the time or
energy but I am still glad I tried.
Because it's not about the RO. Has little to do with emails, texts, or calls. Or the fact that Xfinity spams me with alerts even after you took
responsibility a month ago. It's not about you attesting that I have and will beat you to the police. Or that you have five registered audio/video devices
that can drop in on my most private moments going back to my beach days. Or even Dr Brown's crazy misguided off-target effort that includes no
reunification agenda. It is about the barriers.
See, those are just bumps in the road. Hindrances to the singular thing that matters. And that is if you believe our boys are better off without me. You
have wiped me, and our memories from the house. I assume you would format their brains if you could. And if by whatever means possible, believe
they should have me separated from their existence all altogether. This, all after the best spring and summer we could ever have had together.  
You are omnipotent in this system and your actions demonstrate that eliminating a strong, sober, father figure is your desire. It is not a priority for our
boys to have a biological father as a role model or a positive force in their lives, teaching them lessons learned and passing on wisdom from my failures.
After banishing all positive memories perhaps, you will replace me soon. And with each passing day, it becomes their new narrative, engrained more
deeply, 
I acknowledge the challenges I have introduced into our lives, and I understand the expectation was for me to have navigated my childhood based on
an innate moral compass and not pass anything I learned along. But now the question comes down to redemption and healing. And is that something
we should foster in these young men? Will it serve them better to face the past, do the work, and heal or should they continue down the path of
alienation and punishment?  
Your stance suggests a preference for moving on without addressing the potential for reconciliation and growth. But this overlooks the essence of my
attempts to communicate and reintegrate into our sons' lives, aiming to contribute positively to their development into resilient and capable
individuals. You may see it just as "robert wants to text or call... no way" but it misses the point. I'm trying to knock down obstacles that keep us from
addressing the issues. 
So as another day passes, you sign on for five minutes, spraying a couple of responses before going dark for the next five hours, only to rinse and repeat
twice more before you shut down, I urge you to reflect on the deeper reasons behind my persistence. I am striving to dismantle the barriers preventing
our sons' healing. Please consider if it might be worth taking a moment from Starbucks or your social life, and sitting down to discuss our path

And selfishly I also want to have some normalcy again. I want to be civil with you. I want to be able to have coffee or share a meal and a laugh. I want
to look for a job in earnest. I see a ton at Microsoft I want to apply for these days. But I am not going to do any of that till we have a clear and
confirmed glide path for our future. It's just too volatile and I am not going to put another moment into pretending I can ignore my kids and focus
on finding a new job. 
I'm also done writing these... I am done begging you to work with me. They take time, thought, and energy and it's insanity to think they matter. On
the best day, I'll get a "thank you for the time, I'll come back to this" or "thanks for appreciating I'm not ready to talk to you" or "I get too anxious to
discuss this with you". So please don't candy-coat another reason not to invest time and energy into what should be the most important thing in the
Moyer family's life.
That said, I will continue to work positively with you if you find time and motivation. Stop my job search. And work with Lisa when I have issues.
Thanks again. Wish this had worked.
And on perhaps our last Valentine's Day as a married couple, which I thought would last forever, I'll note one final time- Christine, you are now and
will always be my queen. I love you.

I understand your intent of this message. I also am not sure you realize the trauma and chaos that has been introduced. We were on a path that got
derailed.
You have a story now that you will stick to. Our reality and impact is very different. You have not even reached out to Dr Brien to schedule time.
I see the discussion of stopping a job search as interesting, almost a veiled threat but that’s on you. You’ve know you would be without a job for a year
now. As I’ve busted myself in my role in the craziness chaos, somehow that’s fine for me to do and expected as I’ve done that for 25 years, but for you
that’s impossible. So be it.
My reality of health kids job is all consuming and I don’t have time to craft emails such as below and get criticized when I’m short.
I’ve tried for months and months to move this forward, and have been derailed on so many occasions. To be accused of not putting energy is
maddening.
So as I respond to this, going to be late for breakfast, make lunch, both kid drop off, work back to back meetings, kid pick up, meeting, another kid
pick up, evening call and work, perhaps I should just say, hey, it’s just too much so I’ll just not do it.

I appreciate your perspective and hope you honor mine by finding time to discuss these for the greater good. But that is not happening. And there is
neither a path forward nor progress.
I would love, love, love to help you share your burden. We can talk and discuss what that would need to look like. But not allowing that to happen

Of course... may I kindly suggest an agenda for Sat?
- Meet at Bellevue Starbucks for Decaf- 5:00 pm
- Stroll the Bellevue consignment store- 5:15-5:45 pm
- Visit the “Boy Crib” to get you thoughts- 6:00 pm
- Allow me to prepare a yummy menu- 6:15 pm
- Eat delicious food made with love- 6:45 pm
- Discuss big picture or line items- 7:00 pm
This allows us to slowly, gently, ease into our discussion in a constructive and respectful way. Establish an amicable report, while not being forced
into the ring, bloodied with backs against the wall.
If you feel threatened or I am being unreasonable, you bail. Just like you can hang up or block me. I am strongly incentivized to make this singular
opportunity work, lest we keep this up for months on end.
But... before you say “no” again, please reflect on the status quo, its impact on all of us, and consider that we will never break the cycle till we make an
effort to break the cycle. Again, we are living a catch 22.
So I ask this one time, and perhaps the only time since our anniversary before you left for home, that you will allow me to, not manipulate you, but
instead offer a different solution than what’s not working.
Please put your sword and shield aside. Rearrange plans as I will do, and make this our singular priority for a couple of hours on the singular date/time
you are not all consumed with competing priorities.
You’re still in control, but relax and enjoy the ride...
Take a chance. You won’t be disappointed you did.

It might be a little. But we can discuss. Dr Brown not only did not do what was outlined. She went further to say she is specifically avoiding doing
that. Given it was your suggestion, and I wanted to work with you, I agreed. I think that was fair. But it’s so far off the rails I have not destination even
in sight.
And I agree that it was traumatizing. It was for you and I both as well. But you and I have been given a small chance at least to discuss. We still disagree
but we can be civil and even see each other. AD has not had that opportunity. He is shut out of both an explanation or what I have apologized for.
The net is it continues to fester. The fact that he can’t get a reasonable explanation from his father just reinforces the idea it was nefarious. I know you
are doing what you think is right, but shutting out one whole side of the story and allowing him to draw his own conclusions seems
counterproductive.
Let’s shine some light on this and let him decide.
Dr Brown has no intention of helping the situation.

Please re-read Dr Brown’s mail. It says exactly what I described below. She called it a grey area that she is going to avoid. That is super easy to
understand.
I don’t link her to Yurushka. She had an obligation to talk to you. It’s probably an oath they take?
But she did not have an obligation to say she did not talk to you, when she did.
If this was a police investigation do you really think that would fly? Hell no. She said she did not and did.
None of this matters. If I’m wrong, juts copy paste her plan to address the detailed request we made.

I propose we save the cycles, step away, and focus back on the fact that we need to have a way to work constructively together. Our catch-22’

First, because this is the 3rd time I have had to type this up because OFW sucks. But it’s all I have.
Second, I have no idea what is going on with my account or the Kirkland Xfinity account now.
I am getting all sorts of alerts from App Access to Credit Cards. I don't know what security layers you have now or what might have changed. I just
know my info is passed around on that network and now I am getting constant warnings and security alerts.
We never had this issue before, so I'm bummed it's exploding now. The net is if we can't figure it out, I need to get any of my info that flows through
your network removed- Kill Max's long time game account, kill all credit card info, kill and game pass connection.
And frankly, that is just to protect me. You can make your own decisions about what you are prepared to put on that network, from all of the above
to your confidential emails and even your every keystroke for that matter. You are in the same boat.
I am not trying to finger-point. I bummed this is happening, but its not your area. I don't expect you to understand. And I am sure that if I did our
taxes for the first time and did not allow you to see what I was filing, I'm sure there would be some hiccups as well.
So please don't take it personally... but not only is it not getting fixed. It is rapidly getting much worse.

Just answering your questions. I don't care to fight.
For that matter. Given your reaction this morning, I want to respect your position and don't care to communicate much anymore. You said we both
wanted peace and explained what it would take to get to normalcy. I tried for almost two weeks, and you were mostly pleasant in OFW for which I
appreciate. But we got nothing done, no olive branch, and today we only got worse. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy kicking the football. You can
Google it...
But you asked about the cams that you sent over with the exact same mounts (one single, one none) you said you never knew existed and if they did,
you never knew about them. I won't disagree with you. I just saw you had packed them away and eventually sent them to me. I won't confirm or deny
you knew of them. You just handled them. I gave you the ring for xmas. I did not install it. The others were set up but were not reliable or all that
useful. We took the white indoor cams down, you put the away, but left the outdoor cams up as a deterrent.
- Sending a pic of the Amazon purchase before Xmas in 2020. Install date is unknown tbh.
- Sharing a pic of the outdoor cams, please note how the mounts match the newer ones.
At the risk of repeating myself, I am not saying you knew but you asked two questions I'd like to offer my thoughts on.
One: "If we had them, why didn't I have the Blink App installed?"
I don't know. If you say you never installed it I believe you. I had it, they did a shitty job so perhaps we stopped using them before you even needed to.

You never installed the Beach Cams either. But I had shared them with you (indoor and outdoor) and knew those worked, but never installed the app
for those.
That said, you also never installed:
- Nest App- It works well, you are aware of it, and never installed it, but ask me to use it for you.
- Sleep Number App- It is also helpful but you never installed it. But maybe just did not need to.
- Frame Apps- We had them in the living room and used them daily. You choose not to install.
- Samsung App- It sets the picture you see in the cat room and bedroom. You did not install.
- Alexa- You still have several cam/audio devices that can drop in on me. Not sure what's up.
When we were a loving couple doing our own thing, lots of times I would be geeked out on something, you would smile and nod, feign interest but
not really act. That was normal.
Two: "If we had them, I would have remembered them?"
I don't have any reason to believe you would not, so this may be true too. And I won't fight if you really believe that you have no memory of that. I
will say that we do forget things sometimes, however. Everyone does.
This could be a long list, but you will get the point:
Carbon Monoxide Detector- I made a pretty big deal of this, explaining that I always am sure to take them on vacation with us. I talked about why I
do that and all the crazy AirBnB stories that made me scared. I wanted to protect our family and noted that I would be taking it to protect your
brother along with Justin and Josh. For some reason, it was being used as a WiFi repeater in your clear line of the site where you spend hours every
week. Maybe you forgot?
Private Moments- I asked you recently if you remember our Hyatt stay. You didn't. This surprised me. It was one of the few times we made time for
an overnight together. In the end, we bickered on the way home, but that night, and especially the morning, was an all-time great freaking sweaty, sexy
time. WOW!! And.. we took crazy explicit pics of you. By far the hardest core thing we ever did. Face and all. I won't attach pics. I would think you
would remember, but don't.
My point is everyone forgets things but believes they are absolutely in command of the facts. I have even watched Netflix documentaries on it. It is
called the "eyewitness memory distortion " effect. It's a fascinating human phenomenon and it's super interesting to see it broken down and explained.
That said, who knows, maybe I did not even mention it to you. I may be guilty of the same thing and thought I told you but didn't. But like the
"Alexa drop in" we used often at times; it was just normal when we were a happy family. We did not think of it as spying.
This is of course equally true of:
- Our shared ATT family plan
- Parental control for the kids
- Screen time alerts for the kids
- New device joining Xfinity alerts
I don't really care about what the Luddites in the family law world or the perversion of good intentions into bad, that this has become. When we were
a happy family, this was all approved, discussed, and, welcomed. Protecting your kids in the real world is expected. And phone bills have had call/text
history since long before cell phones even existed.
You didn't ask about things rejoining the network today or about alerts that pop like Blink did. But you have seen them with Samsung Alerts. So, at a
minimum, you have to realize this is a true and demonstratable network phenomenon. I can also prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the cams DO
NOT work in the places you saw them, in the open, pointing at exterior doors.
At this point, I have digressed. But you asked two questions about the cams, and I wanted to give you, my thoughts. If in reading this, you think that
it is simply impossible that what I am saying could ever be true, that's you right. I am only offering my true and honest perspective on the event that
has traumatized you, because I never had any desire to surveil you.... ever.
As mentioned, many times before I am happy to prove this to you in front of your eyes. I have also told you that I bought the new ones at the

Northgate Target and the Blink account was deleted when I realized what it was doing. I wish I could have shown you everything the moment I

Maybe someday we come to terms with all this, but I'm not hopeful anymore. No dialog or shared exchange of perspectives will only entrench and
increase the hate for one another.

I appreciate you responding to my questions below with that level of detail.
One thing that really jumped out for me, and now I am terrified of, given the volatility of the situation, and past threats, is mention of explicit pictures

So... I wanted to let you know after I sent this.
I destroyed all the face, tattoo pics and couple of years ago. You were my wife. I had the real thing whenever I wanted. And I wanted to protect you.
Hacking happens (juts like the last few days) I would never let my Queen be tarnished.They have been long gone.
I will also delete the anonymous ones. I have not looked at them in two years.I have no issues with that. I do want the undie ones that don’t show
anything more than your amazing body and what anyone would see at the beach. Let me know if that is an issue. I’d like those maybe?
What forms and options are you reading about how to come after me if I may ask? I’m not doing any of that. I’m trying to focus on improving us but
you won’t I guess maybe I should stop and light a fire with Lisa. Tell her we need to stop playing nice and start preparing for a frontal assault because
my efforts to heal wounds and co-parent are in vain.
My hope was we could work this out and move on with grace and respect, but not a single hope has materialized. You say I have, and will beat my kids
again. Realistically I assume you might say anything. Perhaps sexual molestation is next. It would be just as true as me beating them and pack an even
more lethal punch for ya.
I have zero desire to cause you harm. I have shown that. I never surveilled you but you won’t even consider if what I have said could even possibly be
true. And it definitely can and I can show you. But you refuse to even watch a real life demonstration. You seem dead set on not even considering an
alternative explanation for the cams or the physical abuse claims you levied against me.
In your heart. Like really deep down below all the hate and willful destruction you have for me, you know, the kids know, the world knows I never
beat you or my kids. To sign your name on a legal document saying that is nuts. Yet that is what you have alleged to god and everyone, including the
courts and police. You don’t think that perhaps, at this point you and Anna Lisa have taken my persecution too far yet?

molestation eventually. As you might do soon. It took years, jail time, and drug the children through hell. And it all never happened. Ot destroyed
innocent lives. But apart from sex abuse, we are no different. It’s playing out the exact same way so far.
And please, don’t act like you are not capable of that. It’s insulting to us both with your signature sitting on a legal document with the court and
police department alleging that I beat my family. It’s just the other side of the same coin you have already used.

As an FYI-
Sharing two of the live cams you have had in my place since the beach days. You also had one on your desk but not sure what it was used for, but
know it acts as the receiver for watching video and listening for audio. I didn't know about them so moved them from Alki to Bellevue thinking they
were innocent. I still assume they are, but want to confirm.
But both have drop-in enabled. So as we have done so many times in the past, you can just "drop in" unannounced and see and hear everything that
goes on in the most private spaces of my home, not outside in public view where the expectation of privacy is far different. These were great when we
needed them for a quick check in on the kids.
Then of course, a bunch more (registered to you, again) came over recently that if I plug in, can also monitor audio and video via drop-in. That is
actually how I found out about the other two that were in my place for who knows how long. I drilled into who they were currently registered to and
what they were capable of.

I want to be helpful and hope after all of this mess on my, you are not using these "drop-in" devices for anything nefarious. Or trying to sneak in new
digital trojan horses, but you see what I see and have shared. So, they could all be used to spy on me if you want, its just a question of if you are using
them. And again- I honestly do not think you are.
This was one of the core reasons I tried to open a dialog with you this week. It is in the emails I sent and on the list you asked me to document of
things to discuss. I don't believe this is intentional, especially after all we have struggled with in this area. And that's why I wanted it to stay between
us. I totally give you the benefit of the doubt here.
So let me know how would like to proceed given we can't communicate peacefully. I still want to resolve this constructively, but I'm stuck between a
rock and a hard place if I can't even talk to you about it. And I am NOT making any threats. I am NOT coming after you for cameras in my place. I
am looking to resolve this and prefer not to go through attorneys.
Can you let me know your thoughts? If you go dark, I'll assume you are going straight to Anna Lisa instead of working with me. I hope that is not the
case for the aforementioned reasons. I honestly believe this is an innocent mistake we can just resolve. I can even talk you through "unregistering"
them so you can't drop in on me anymore!
Let's please use common sense and just let me help... This is a super easy fix for us.
We can be civil one last time before we burn the bridge behind us. Just let me know!

Please don't go there. That is not fair to me. I would have parted the Red Sea for you and the boys and was fast on the path to self-improvement with
your blessing and approval. There is literally nothing in my life I would not have changed for you.
If you had got off that plane from Hong Kong and said "Robert, I am serious as a heart attack. I know it appears that we are doing our best ever, and
you may think you are making improvements, but none of it is good enough. Period. I realize now that this is a five-alarm fire. I did not before. So I
am putting you on notice. You need to listen to my concerns and put something in place that salvages our family after years of destruction.
Otherwise, I am walking."
And if you want to know the truth, Christine, I might still be open to it. Even with all that has happened. I don't want the Moyers to blow up. Or
leave a man behind. I want to fix it, more than ever. With the knowledge and wisdom of past mistakes so that we can all thrive together.

<< This is in your email. I found it looking for the basketball schedule. It’s sad that it was so clear at the start of December that we would end up here.
Before any of this cam shit. A full month before that was even an issue you had ended all contact with the kids. This was your “strategy” is what you
told Debbie. Even after we all agreed in our counseling that I needed to move on and make “new traditions” for us.
This was so predictable. It’s the logical path you choose as soon as you met Yurushka. I said it then, I have said it many times since, and I’ll say it again
tonight- You will stop at nothing to destroy me, my history and my future. You are eager and willing to sacrifice the kids relationship with their father,
even in his sobriety and health. You started months ago, it’s noted below, and you will never admit it. Just like with you and Kevin, always a reason to
deny the truth>>
I agree that we need a parenting plan ASAP. Most of the disagreements we have are related to being able to spend time with my family. I also have a
lot of regrets wrt how this has gone. Obviously, I did not see this coming, and as we have involved various third parties, the acrimony and disdain have
intensified to an unbearable level.
Oddly enough, I was reading a communication we had in August. We were still having lunch, dinners, doing joint projects, and enjoying amazing xxx.

We both knew we were getting a divorce, but we were still kind to each other. We still recognized each other and our positive role in our kids' lives.
But something really came off the rails fast and hard when others started telling us what we “should be doing”
And our response has been a self-fulfilling spiral of increased animosity to the point where we can't even imagine being kind anymore. I mentioned I
am taking a step back and trying to operate differently. I want to start with civility and work our way back to mental health. I hope you can take a

Message 1440 of 4024
If you are in counseling my hope is that they are helping you see what I’m trying to do is in best interest of my emotional mental and physical health
and that of kids.
The impact to you I can’t help, and are consequences of your direct actions.
My objective is not to destroy you as you state below. The continuing blame on me for how you feel and situation is incredible. You have control of
your actions.
If you have decided you can’t look for gainful employment, that is a choice you have made. The relationship with Max is a direct consequence of your
interactions with him. I can go on. Putting blame on me for your situation is again a choice you are making.
A theme that has been recurring in your life has been its always someone else’s fault for your woes and resulting behavior that results, your
upbringing, your mom, your dad, your boss, the therapists, and now you have trained it squarely on me as the reason for all things bad.
It’s certainly one way to go through life if that’s worked for you. The past 25 years, I pushed forward inspite of what was happening. I could have
easily taken the same approach but I didn’t.  I’m going to continue that approach but have also pivoted to not accept actions towards me that are
completely unacceptable and will not sweep things under the rug. That did not serve me well and I finally woke up to that.
Actions have consequences which you have never fully felt, and are understandably jarred that you are being held accountable.
Everything that took a turn was a result of some action taken. Perhaps that is the connection you are not making. What was the action that caused the
reaction? Things just don’t happen out of the blue.

Align on child support

Align on division of assets
Set a mediation date.

I have alerts. As soon as you send something, you get a reply in one minute. And we can resolve something we are discussing. But you fire at me, and
then go back to the foxhole for 3-14 hours.
Just from a communication efficiency perspective, and maybe even common decency to someone else, can you please consider not doing that? It is

It’s not an intentional poke.
You write very long emails and if I just respond with an ok, I get criticized, if I don’t respond immediately because it deserves a more thoughtful
approach I get criticized.
I just don’t have the same cycles as you. And some nights I fall asleep after multiple long days.
It’s a no win for me and you weaponize it.
Look at the number of emails today. I  started my work day a few hours ago and your expectation is I devote unlimited mind share to this.
Back and forth takes away. You even it said it yourself. How are you expected to do a full time job in this situation. I do. I have global responsibility
for a multi national corporation. I know you have never taken that seriously or understand the full scope of what I own and manage, based on your
actions and just expecting me to cope and clean up and time shift and deal
With the craziness that is inserted into my life.
Milan was a prime example of full day meetings, managing the US as they logged in the emea afternoon, juggling multiple audits in us, Asia and
Europe, while a colleague was out for an emergency, and insisting I spend hours and hours on the phone with  you and texts and email
communications. That is documented in your emails, calls and texts. You have complete disregard for your impact to others. It’s just about you. I
specifically told you the general manager of the roastery is watching me as I begged to get off the phone to do my job and you insisted I stay on for 1.5
hours. The office was deserted when we wrapped except for her and I.

Question: What are the public consequences of getting a restraining order against you?
When someone has a restraining order issued against them, it can have several public and personal consequences, some of which may significantly
affect their life and activities. Here's a general overview of potential public consequences:

Subject:Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me
Page 388 of 1048


When someone has a restraining order issued against them, it will have several public and personal consequences, some of which may significantly
affect their future life and activities.
Here's a general overview of the consequences:
1. **Employment Impact**: Having a restraining order against you will likely affect your current employment and future job prospects. When
employers conduct background checks they will view the restraining order as a serious negative character reference. Professions involving trust and
security (like teaching, law enforcement, information technology, or positions that require security clearances), will be particularly impacted.
2. **Housing Challenges**: Landlords may also conduct background checks and may be hesitant to rent to someone with a restraining order against
them, fearing potential legal issues or disturbances.
3. **Educational Opportunities**: Universities and other educational institutions sometimes conduct background checks for admissions or housing.
A restraining order could negatively impact these opportunities.
4. **Social Stigma**: There is a social stigma attached to having a restraining order against you. Community members, neighbors, and acquaintances
will view you differently based on the existence of the order, which can lead to social isolation or difficulties in personal relationships.
5. **Firearm Restrictions**: In many jurisdictions, a restraining order can restrict your ability to own or possess firearms. This can affect those whose
professions require the use of firearms or individuals who hunt or participate in shooting sports.
6. **Travel and Mobility Restrictions**: A restraining order may include specific locations you are barred from visiting, which can affect your
mobility. This might include common areas like a shared workplace, school, or even shared children's locations in cases of domestic issues.
7. **Custody and Visitation**: If the restraining order involves family or domestic situations, it can have serious implications for custody and
visitation rights with children.
8. **Public Records**: Restraining orders are part of the public record, which means that anyone doing a public records search can find information
about you and why you have the order placed on you.
9. **Professional Licenses**: Certain professions that require licensing may take disciplinary actions against individuals with restraining orders, or it
may affect the ability to obtain professional licenses in the first place.
Question: That sounds really terrible for someone who has one filed against them. Are the details of the restraining order public so anyone can find
them? Example: If my wife said that likely to physically assault her and my kids would someone be able to see that?
The details of a restraining order, including any reasons for its issuance and the specific restrictions it imposes, are a matter of public record for anyone
to see. This means that the information contained within the restraining order, such as allegations of expected physical violence towards a spouse and
children, are fully accessible to the public at large. Here are some exceptions:
1. **Jurisdiction**: Different states or countries have different rules regarding the accessibility of court records. While most jurisdictions consider
restraining orders to be public records, the ease with which someone can access these records can vary but most make these records searchable and
available online.
2. **Online Databases**: Court records, including restraining orders, are readily available through online databases. This makes it relatively easy for
individuals to search for and find details of restraining orders, who they were filed by and against, and the reasons for filing the restraining order.
3. **Protection of Minors**: In cases involving children, courts can take steps to protect their identities and specific details from public disclosure. The
overarching details of the order will be public, but the names of minors could be redacted or otherwise protected.
Individuals concerned about the privacy of their information in legal documents like restraining orders should consult with a legal professional to
understand the specifics of their situation. The long-term negative consequences of a restraining order on the restricted person are not to be
understated. They have lifelong, enduring and very public consequence to the restrained person.

This is what YOUR lawyer suggested to mine.
I’m sure your counsel walked you through what an RO was and impact it has before you signed.
In fact YOU REQUESTED ONE AGAINST ME!
So what you are saying I did to you, was what you were prepared to do to me, for having a Tesla app that you knew could verify I only logged on to
unlock your car twice at your instruction.

My lawyer suggested a ROnto restrict digital surveillance. You and your lawyer said I beat you and the kids. Details matter. You two made that claim
that you two can support in court with prior Hillary and witnesses if pressed.
I’m not in a fighting mood. You said if we wanted to change it just tell Anna Lisa. But then you pulled it back after you talked to her. So there is no
question who came up with the physical violence angle. Let’s not argue.

BTW- Why on Gods green earth would my own attorney say I beat you and my kids and will again. She suggested an RO for you, like you noted.
And when push comes to shove, we would need to be able to prove that, right? Making false allegations to obtain an RO is a really big deal in custody
fights. That’s easy research.!Both for the person saying it and any officer of the court who facilitate it.
That is why I have been asking over and over, week after week, to pull that shit back. We have discussed many times and you agreed. But then you
went to Anna Lisa and doubled down. Then proclaimed “Inal in charge Robert” I wondered why on earth you would do that when we could
peacefully resolve, but you specifically insisted on saying that crap.
At the end of the day, if you say it, you have to prove it. There is nothing to fight about. I tried to let us both back off this crazy escalation, you seemed
to agree all week and then on Friday someone else joins the party. That is why I want to talk! This stuff is bat shit crazy, and someone will find out I
don’t beat you all at some point. Because it never happened.

Dr Brown I believe is following our ask. If you noted her alarmed at what transpired, my personal
Opinion is that’s it’s justified. You have a different lens on your actions and what they are labeled as, and impact. I don’t think you and I have come
across anyone that minimizes your actions from your lens, rather they raise alarm bells. My eyes are wide open now to what was happening and how
they are characterized despite your efforts to downplay.

Please take a moment and read your response. It really makes very little sense. I don’t know if it is just awful grammar or you are calling me a lawyer?
The first paragraph is indecipherable. Please clarify.
And I did not note her alarm. I know you two secretly met as you confirmed and she denied, but I was not involved in that. So I have no way of
judging her reaction to one side of an easy solved riddle.
I have zero idea what the “eyes wide open” comment means. Is this for our 25 year marriage? Or Is it for the cams that did not exist but were sent to
me? Or the impossible reconnect that you see the TVs do too?
You still did not answer the single most and original question I sent.two days and roughly eight hours ago. I have approval to see Adrian from Dr
Brown. That was your requirement. So how do I see him now?
You also completely skipped the question about doing as Dr Brown had asked us to do and you committed to last week. So we begin to work more
peacefully and constructively together again.
And as you consider how I downplayed things in my past, do you think you might have downplayed your affair with Kevin? It was worth flat out
lying about to your husband’s face. Did you downplay that at all?
As you reply, may I ask you to save the extra words as I do for you. Also please answer the questions. If this is the only format you will permit, it will
do us good if you can show even the most primitive attempt here.
Given the “emergency” exception noted, how do I get in touch in that case? You plan to stick to this I see, and say I beat you and my kids (the truth
will come out) but I don’t know how to reach you, right?
