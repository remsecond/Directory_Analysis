He was still feeling not great today but better.\nMessage 1174 of 4024\nAD- ok, I will respect that even if I disagree.\nDr Brown- Below is what I shared yesterday:\n\"I would like to have a positive and constructive discussion about the goals of this meeting, scope of the discussion, relevant participants, expected\ndeliverables, how we plan to use them. \"\nHow can we do this 1-1, or with Dr Brown before we meet? We only have today and tomorrow.\nAAU- I will do that today. Thanks for the reminder.\nArm- must have really been a soft tissue strain. He should have been in a sling. I did not know it was still an issue and was focused on the cold.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 12:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...\nMessage 1175 of 4024\nAn RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified.\nI am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any violation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I\nwould hope you received same guidance.\nFor Dr Brown, we will need to align here.\nShe asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me.\nMy goal is to update of situation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will\nconsider. We all have a different perspective on what occurred. Impact to Adrian and me was/is real. I am not going to brush aside Adrian’s concerns\nthat he expressed to me.\nI’d like to confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we loose the spot and it gets pushed out further.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 12:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 12:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",
