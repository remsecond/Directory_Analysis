What do you want from\nme?\nYou said many times you were moving forward. I have no idea where you have landed today and your story changes. We really need a running list\nsync.\nPer my employment, you know you told the State of Washington I have been beating my kids and will likely do it again so you need protection.\nWe both know. The kids know. Everybody alive knows, that is a flat out lie. The ultimate betrayal and undermining of me as a father and person.\nPlease stop the non-stop daily assault through the legal system. It is counterproductive and hurtful. I want to work with you. Not fight fires.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:34 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS/Adrian\nMessage 844 of 4024\nDid you understand this incredibly clear explanation from both me and the fact check from the foremost AI tool known to man?\nIt’s so good that there has been congressional testimony around the possibility and timing of when it could become sentient.\nIf none of that convinces you, then you are either incapable of understand, or being intentionally uninformed. Not sure what to do.\nPlease share this with the boys if it helps. But, for the love of god, please allow me to explain this if it scares them. It’s all very real and relevant.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: WiFi/connected devices/kids communication\nMessage 845 of 4024\nThis has all come down to one issue. Period. You and the boys think I am tracking you. It comes up on every thread.\nYou make statements that are true for one scenario and false in another. But accuracy is important in this discussion.\nPlease find a way to facilitate a discussion and education on what we have now or had as a happy family before.\nThen we can severe what we want, as I asked you to do for my own safety for Xfinity and ATT accounts. It’s super simple.\nBut to keep spinning and trying to create lawyer bait is really unhelpful. Please stop. Please let me answer your questions.\nThis will have a long term impact on our family if we keep deceiving our kids by intentionally not educating them. Please stop.\nAll of this. Our entire situation is based on disinformation. This will come out at some point. Please open yourself education.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:22 AM)\nSubject:Stop the Forked Threads",
