  "text": "I’m going to tell AD I love him and I have all his stuff packed up ready to go back to Kirkland. I have always told him I was proud of him for sharing\nhis concerns and will continue to do so.\nI also would like to share what happened so he knows my explanation and that I agree with what he saw. I need to let him know I can’t see him\nanymore but I love him dearly and he can always call.\nI know we have plans for Dr Brown but I don’t know what they are and I think I have accepted after all these months of trying to get something,\nanything in place, i just won’t see my boys again.\nI’m not a victim, there is just always a reason that all this horrible nightmare won’t end. And if it’s all my fault - you, the kids, retirement, I need to\neventually accept the blame and start a new life.\nPlease be there for AD... I don’t want him upset but at some point I have to be honest and stop leading him on. We FaceTime every day so he can see\nprogress. Its super fun but It’s not right to keep that lie going. He will never trust me if I do.\nMessage 818 of 4024\nHis room is all re-packed. I finished today. It’s not a ton of stuff but it is meaningful. That is why it was here. I’ll be sure Elsa brings it all back so don’t\nwant him to think I just took it and had no plans to return.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 01:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 819 of 4024\nSorry. Last thing (I hope) I put the new basketball goal and ping pong table on Craigslist. If you want to send pics of the peloton or other things, I can\nmange all at once.\nOr we can wait till it gets here if that ever happens in our new world. For that matter I guess the ping pong table could get moved to Kirkland too. It’s\nnice but only 90% together.\nI’m out. It’s been a hard day. Have a safe trip. I’m trying to remove you as my emergency contact too.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 01:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 01:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 820 of 4024\nMy hope was Dr. Brown could help navigate this situation but you have decided the outcome.\nI didn’t create this situation and can’t control what you communicate to him.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 01:51 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 01:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>",
