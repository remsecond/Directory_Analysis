I am trying to communicate.\nShe lied to me. Period. If she had an obligation, that is fine. But she lied about what she did. I don’t think her obligation is to lie.\nIf you and I would like to go back and relitigate everything from the car to the phone to the Xfinity to the cam , we can. But that is not what we were\ntrying to do.\nIf you have changed your mind, I would just like to know . I am honestly trying to work with you here because I think in your heart you believe that\nthe boys should both have a dad.\nHow can we work together to understand our true intentions given that someone involved now is a liar ?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1313 of 4024\nNo one lied.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:09 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1314 of 4024\nI’m trying...
