  "text": "narrative. So you will ignore it.\nAnd if you are in control, why was the wrong RO filed?\nYou did that? So now we have actually been violating it on both sides all week. We can’t even do an “fyi” forward. We both broke the RO now. Zero\n1-1’s\nAnd why are you offering up something I have already signed. How does that make any sense. I already signed it. Thats being in control?\nAnd you have zero idea about the discussion with Elsa. You have no clue what she said. About our swinging or what she told me about you and\nKevin.\nI’m going to stop. I promised to be helpful, not attack even in the face of accusations and insults. I am really trying, Christine. I’m not going to stop.\nPlease consider I listened to you. I don’t know why you started hating on me tonight, all I know is you spoke with the person who can’t file the right\nRO.\nCan we please go back to working towards a common goal and quit trying so hard to destroy me? I honestly loved you more than life itself. And I’m\ntrying.\nMessage 1246 of 4024\nYou know I went back and read what I’ve been saying to you over the last few days. I looked at my tone. I looked at my cooperation, and I looked to\nsee if I was manipulating you.\nI honestly hope you will take a moment and just review some of the things that I was trying to do. I hope that you’ll step back and look objectively at\nour communications.\nI know you see me as some sort of evil villain, but I’m not, I don’t know why you interpret everything I do is some plot to abuse you. that is not my\nintent at all in this relationship\nI’m honestly and sincerely trying to listen to you while you are still my wife and be the man you are telling me I need to be for you. I’m doing this for\nour children and our mental health.\nI’ve been saying since July, just tell me what I did wrong. You don’t have to hate me so much, Christine I am not doing anything with malice or hate\ntowards you. Please see our threads.\nI’m at a loss now on how to behave or what you want from me. It feels like nothing I do is right, no matter how hard I try. I don’t know why you can’\nt see that. I’m just honestly so confused.\nI would like to keep trying\nSent:02/09/2024 at 04:56 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 07:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Move\nMessage 1247 of 4024\nI know you want to get the sitting room in our place furnished again and I think you are going to use ferninsh based on our last conversation.
