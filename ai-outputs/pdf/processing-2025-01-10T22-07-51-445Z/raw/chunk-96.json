But that’s clearly gonna take some time.\nIn the meantime, I also noted that we should consider it for more complicated lists where we need to respond in line to each other.\nOFW is not built for that. And when I copy paste, the format goes to hell. We should also consider non-narrative list emails that help us.\nObviously not at this time, but we can take smart baby steps to normalcy. And if I continue to head your advice, I’m confident we will get there.\nLet me know if my list is confusing... thanks\nSent:02/05/2024 at 12:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 12:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size\nMessage 1109 of 4024\nThey are here. Won’t take long. Apparently you have bolts for tv. They will pick up after they unload at your place and come back here.\nI’ll message when they head over\nSent:02/05/2024 at 01:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 01:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size\nMessage 1110 of 4024\nSo... somehow I ended up with a big box of bondage stuff, blindfolds, whips, ticklers, collars, ball gags.. you name it.\nI don’t think I’ll find anyone that will travel with, and since it was only used with you anyway, do you want them?\nIf we want to be sure they all still work before you decide, I going to volunteer to help just once for old times sake.\nIt won’t mean anything of course...\nSent:02/05/2024 at 01:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 01:19 PM)\nSubject:Intimacy",
