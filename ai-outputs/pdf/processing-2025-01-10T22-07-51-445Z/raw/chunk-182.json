  "text": "forward for Max and AD.\nAnd selfishly I also want to have some normalcy again. I want to be civil with you. I want to be able to have coffee or share a meal and a laugh. I want\nto look for a job in earnest. I see a ton at Microsoft I want to apply for these days. But I am not going to do any of that till we have a clear and\nconfirmed glide path for our future. It's just too volatile and I am not going to put another moment into pretending I can ignore my kids and focus\non finding a new job.\nI'm also done writing these... I am done begging you to work with me. They take time, thought, and energy and it's insanity to think they matter. On\nthe best day, I'll get a \"thank you for the time, I'll come back to this\" or \"thanks for appreciating I'm not ready to talk to you\" or \"I get too anxious to\ndiscuss this with you\". So please don't candy-coat another reason not to invest time and energy into what should be the most important thing in the\nMoyer family's life.\nThat said, I will continue to work positively with you if you find time and motivation. Stop my job search. And work with Lisa when I have issues.\nThanks again. Wish this had worked.\nAnd on perhaps our last Valentine's Day as a married couple, which I thought would last forever, I'll note one final time- Christine, you are now and\nwill always be my queen. I love you.\n-robert\nMessage 1374 of 4024\nI understand your intent of this message. I also am not sure you realize the trauma and chaos that has been introduced. We were on a path that got\nderailed.\nYou have a story now that you will stick to. Our reality and impact is very different. You have not even reached out to Dr Brien to schedule time.\nI see the discussion of stopping a job search as interesting, almost a veiled threat but that’s on you. You’ve know you would be without a job for a year\nnow. As I’ve busted myself in my role in the craziness chaos, somehow that’s fine for me to do and expected as I’ve done that for 25 years, but for you\nthat’s impossible. So be it.\nMy reality of health kids job is all consuming and I don’t have time to craft emails such as below and get criticized when I’m short.\nI’ve tried for months and months to move this forward, and have been derailed on so many occasions. To be accused of not putting energy is\nmaddening.\nSo as I respond to this, going to be late for breakfast, make lunch, both kid drop off, work back to back meetings, kid pick up, meeting, another kid\npick up, evening call and work, perhaps I should just say, hey, it’s just too much so I’ll just not do it.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 07:03 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 07:04 AM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!\nMessage 1375 of 4024\nI apologize for that email.
