I am making it very\nclear this is to move some critical items forward and there is no expectation for any future connects like this.\nMy proposal will be we have a mediator involved  on prearranged discussion if one is needed in the future if approved.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 03:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 03:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 926 of 4024\nI’m fine with that. And frankly, if I am twisting your arm, I’ll withdraw the ask. I was trying to help but realize that right now there is a lot of tension.\nPlease don’t do it if you feel like I am controlling you.\nAnd to be clear again, I asked for a team’s call because it seems like it may help. I am not trying to violate our RO and am never going to try and use\nthis if we choose against you. You’re being a good parent.\nI’ll send the running link invite to you.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 03:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 03:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication\nMessage 927 of 4024\nWe forgot Shoot 360. Unless I hear otherwise, I'll sign him up by tomorrow. Good?\nSent:02/01/2024 at 04:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 04:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
