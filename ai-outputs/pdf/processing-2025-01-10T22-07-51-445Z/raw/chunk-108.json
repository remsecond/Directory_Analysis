  "text": "\"The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted herein. The parties may\ncommunicate via the Our Family Wizard application, and the Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely for the purpose\nof co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding the management of shared assets. The parties may also communicate via\nemail with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.\nBelow is what I would like to propose:\n- Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to\ncommunicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward\ncommunications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.\n- Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children\nand/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted for in-depth,\nmulti-topic communications and or \"FYI notifications\", without the mandatory inclusion of a third party. This is under the condition that both\nparties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone. If a communication is deemed potentially contentious, a mutually agreed upon third\nparty may be included at the discretion of either party for oversight, with prior written agreement.\n- Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed\nurgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior written agreement in the Our Family Wizard platform or a related email.\nThis is under the condition that both parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone.\n- Additional Conditions: Should either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to\nreview and potential revision to ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.\nI think this sets us up for longer-term success (important, so we are not doing this every two weeks as we grow as co-parents) but also still allows for\nthe opportunity to re-visit if one of us starts behaving badly... It is optimistic but the best of both worlds with a built-in \"out\".\nThanks in advance for your thoughtful consideration. (Doing this email in OFW sucked btw )\nrobert\nMessage 1148 of 4024\nBTW- There is no RO. There never has been. I know you kept saying that, but Anna Lisa never filed it. I've reviewed all the case history.\nI sent my thoughts separately as I anticipated this and wanted to be as helpful as I could given today is mandatory \"in the office\" day and likely back to\nback..\nAck- on availability. Too bad I can't swing by with fresh poke, avocado and lemons... I really enjoyed taking care of you, seeing you smile. I think your\nline was \"Why are you always so sweet to me\"\nSent:02/06/2024 at 10:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 11:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
