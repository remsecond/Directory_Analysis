Thank you for trying Robert.\nSent:02/17/2024 at 08:52 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1486 of 4024\nIf it’s not too much trouble... I would love to know if you will reconsider your earlier decision not to try a baby step towards a more peaceful, safe,\ntime boxed detente for the Moyer’s. I far prefer that and will change any plans to give peace a shot. But if you are still not willing, I’ll try and schedule\nsomething else.\nSent:02/17/2024 at 09:29 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 04:34 PM)\nSubject:Re: Today\nMessage 1487 of 4024\nThe irony is neither of us know how to stop these. I did not know how to stop them when we’re on a shared account. You don’t know how to stop\nspamming me with them now.\nBut somehow, in this crazy fucked up world. It means that I am digitally monitoring you. And that means DV. It’s beyond crazy. Especially since it\nwas all set up to just protect you and our kids.\nHow the legal system perverts network security and parental control into domestic violence now is beyond fucked up and we both, in our sane mind\nknow that. How is that used against me?\nSent:02/17/2024 at 03:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 04:34 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1459.PNG (1 MB)",
