  "text": "Message 841 of 4024\nSAAS tuition is 48k before study skills.\nPutting Adrian there is a significant commitment of resources that I am uncomfortable with not knowing your plans for job etc.\nYou never responded regarding if I should reach out or not but he is asking and said you told him you did so already.\nPlease let’s align on next steps. Ball is in your court.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:04 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 07:27 AM)\nSubject:SAAS/Adrian\nMessage 842 of 4024\nI would like to have the Lugg sent to my house. But, I don’t need more junk. You sent actual bags of trash last time instead of the list of documented\nthings we agreed to move.\nThe text messages is accurate. We have family plans, Christine. Please go into yours and you can see what is tracked for yourself. This is a service. This\nis not spying. I keep explaining that.\nIf everyone wants to pay for their own accounts that is fine. Phone, internet, Netflix, Xbox, office. We did this as a family till you did your thing. That\nis normal. Please don’t present it as otherwise.\nIf everyone chooses to be thier own person, and ignore that we are a family, that is ok. But i will not be expecting to pay the bills for that. It is an\nunnatural act. If you are not family, you are not.\nThe game suggested is very real. I am trying to teach you all about your digital footprint. It is not spying, like the way schools offer internet safety\ncourses. Knowledge is actually helpful to us all.\nAnd per your last line. You are mixing metaphors. Please stop! You can see phone calls and texts. But who wants to? Who cares? Please see ChatGPT\nexplaining this to you to educate yourself.\nCan we PLEASE facilitate a safe discussion so I can do as i have offered. Back and forth here is useless. It is straightforward if you don’t mix and\nmatch things to try and play “gotcha”. I can help you.\nEach data point is very specific. Acting like this is one big tracking report is inaccurate. Please let me help you understand what you are mixing up. A\nsingle whiteboard session will do. I promise you.\nPlease quit putting your head in the sand and making this worse. Let’s stop. Explain. Ask questions. Make decisions. This is simply not nefarious.\nSent:01/30/2024 at 07:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 08:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Friday Practice",
