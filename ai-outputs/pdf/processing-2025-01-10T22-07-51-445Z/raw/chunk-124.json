And tbh, I would be happy for us to visit her every 6? weeks for a general check up that can\nrotate kids. Maybe Elsa is first up next. It can’t hurt us?\nFor the Domestic Abuse and Dad is a Physical Threat discussion, we can still table till you catch your breath. I can assure you I would not be coming\nover to beat you guys up, RO or not. Just not my style.\nI am sorry you have so much going on. I know how stressful your job is and the toll it takes. Hopefully when we get things in better shape, I can\nshoulder some of this and load balance a bit as coparents.\nI really want to stay on this trajectory with you!\nSent:02/07/2024 at 05:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 05:51 PM)\nSubject:Time Tonight?\nMessage 1186 of 4024\nDid she respond?
