Xfinity brokers that handshake with\nApple.\nIt has nothing to do with ATT. Neither did the other. And it is frustrating. Apple iOS sees a trigger in the cloud and pumps it out to my MAC\naddress.\nStuff happens in the service and even I don’t always grok the trigger. But in both cases, we know what made those fire. We just don’t know how to\nstop it.\nIt’s not going to kill us as long as I don’t go to jail or loose future employability for it.

I’m asking how we proceed given my legal liabilities. If I see you read this, know I’m over a barrel trying to help you, but you don’t say anything\nstill, I get nervous. If should address through attorneys I can. I was just hoping to peacefully cooperate.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 08:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1344 of 4024\nHey There!\nHoping we can make legit progress tomorrow. Today we were kind to each other and that is a fantastic start, but it proves the point again that OFW\ndoesn't work.
