  "text": "Message 1093 of 4024\nShould I ask him to do two trips with you sending items back then I send him back if needed?\nI just assumed we move what we needed to in one go and not try arrange a time at later date. It’s been difficult to coordinate if we are seeking to have a\ncrew we know and trust.\nDeavon will mount my tv today.\nAre you paying him or me? He takes Venmo so I can do it easily and add tip. It comes out of BofA.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:44 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!\nMessage 1094 of 4024\nSo... great question. But the only big item would be the bikes, at this point. What else?\nAwesome he is doing the TV. You might see if he can help set up the Wii like I had it.\nPlease pay with Venmo. I think you are including a tip from last time too.\nIf we get stuck today on a time sensitive decision, just call. I’m fine with that.\nWoot woot!

Do you know? I think he is actually bigger than me now. I don’t wanna bother sending over old tops, but he seems to like\nsome of my Capri style pants Since they are all actually pretty nice and expensive. Even if they are just a size or two off, the dry cleaning lady can take\nthose in. But I’m too far from being able to do that. Perhaps I will make a pile of those along with the flip-flops for a swap at Basketball.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:57 AM)\nSubject:Max Size\nMessage 1096 of 4024\nI think he is 32 but send over. If you can’t use at least he gets first refusal and they are expensive.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 09:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size",
