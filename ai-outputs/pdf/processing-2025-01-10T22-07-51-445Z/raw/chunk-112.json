  "text": "Ok. I'll reach out to Luis and shop around.\nI do need roof, I'll all them and check it out.\nDo you know how much Qi charges?\nI don't think I need backflow or pest control.\nI don't have a dog you know that. It's a joke.\nI have several other things I'd like to fyi to you or touch base on, but I don't think we got running list accommodations. Only email to and from other\npeople for kids stuff with each other CC'd.\nMessage 1156 of 4024\nI have calls now through early evening.\nYour lawyer return a signed updated  RO this am.\nSent:02/06/2024 at 04:29 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 04:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1157 of 4024\nI think you said now would be when we would try to work on this...\nI think we have three big issues:\n- Domestic abuse in the court filing (you said Lisa should send a note and you would help).\n- I sent the suggestions you requested in the RO. The other is already filed. We should update.\n- We are getting close to the Dr Brown date, and I'd still like to collaborate on that with you.\nPlease note the additional details for each in the appropriate OFW threads or eMails sent.\nThis stuff is stressful as hell, like watching paint dry, and creates unnecessary anxiety and stress.\nI'd like to progress on these items ASAP so we can quit the back and forth. Just let me know.\nBut after discussing for a while now, I don't think have any way to do a running list discussion.\nWhat would you like to do teammate? We are still being super civil.\nSent:02/06/2024 at 04:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 06:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
