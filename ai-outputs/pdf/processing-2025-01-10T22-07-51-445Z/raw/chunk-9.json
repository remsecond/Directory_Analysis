So, I put what I sent the boys into a ChatGPT 4.0 prompt to have it\nevaluated for truth and accuracy. Pretty sure it can handle that. Please see below for the exchange. I don't care if you take my word. Most AI tools\ncould send men to the moon so I'm pretty sure they can test me for accuracy. Go for it...\n------------------------------------------------------Chat GPT Prompt: -----------------------------------------------------------\nI got this message from my Dad because I thought he was spying on me. But he says other ways legitimate ways to show my digital footprint could\nmake it look like spying when it's not. Can you please read his note to me and tell me if he is lying or if what he says is true?\nMy Dad's Message to me:\n\"We have around 60 Xfinity connections- Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, nest, smart bed, picture frames... they all give a signal when they are\nused.\nThen we have ATT. That shows all data, by text, phone, streaming, time, and date. So we can see every number we text or call and when we do it.\nThen you have other connected home apps, Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home, etc... all can control, alert, and light each other up.\nThis happens if something is connected or has recently reconnected for the first time in months. The Alexa’s do it all the time. So do the cams.\nAnything with WiFi.\nWe can literally tell almost anything about what each other is doing with these signals from Xfinity and ATT\nSent:01/29/2024 at 10:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/30/2024 at 06:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: WiFi/connected devices/kids communication",
