And when I told you AD and I have never discussed (which is\nWAY more important) you did not respond. It has not happened. When could it happen? At a basketball game?\nI propose we save the cycles, step away, and focus back on the fact that we need to have a way to work constructively together. Our catch-22’\nrelationship will only compound and infect even the simplest discussions we have. Let’s focus on that first!\nHopeful you will see fit to agree with the Sat agenda!\nHave a great day!\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 01:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 1394 of 4024\nNot requesting action.

It just fired again as I was typing this... lol\nSent:02/14/2024 at 02:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 04:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1378.PNG (3 MB)",
