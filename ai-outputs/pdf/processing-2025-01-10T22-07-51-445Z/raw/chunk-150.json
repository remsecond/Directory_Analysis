I did\nthat.\nI thought where we were hung up was the idea that the originals never exist existed, and you did not know. But here they are. And you put them\naway.\nI really don’t want to fight. I will look. But they did exist. And whether you remember or not, you did at some point come into physical contact with\nthem.\nSo that part of the entire story (and Elsa laying into me about them not existing) doesn’t appear to be accurate. We have to acknowledge at least that.\nThe other thing we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt is- they DONT work in the garage. It’s not possible. No need to debate it. We can see.\nI can also show you that if you go out of WiFi, they stop. Come back in they connect, just like your laptop does. No intervention is needed. It’s called\n“retry”\nWe don’t need to debate. It is all provable. We could do it tonight. I should have said something that night. I know that. I’m sorry. But I was not\nspying.\nCan we please work on this together?\nSent:02/09/2024 at 09:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: All Our Family Memories\nMessage 1276 of 4024\nHate to be the bearer of bad news.... This just landed a few minutes ago. This shit is tough to turn off.\nIt still floors me that getting these, when we were just trying to do right by our children is domestic violence.\nDivorce court is unfortunately not a good place for a geeky dad with best intentions to protect his kids.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 09:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1318.PNG (5 MB)\nMessage 1277 of 4024\nOh... one more thing... you thought it had videos stored. I can also show you that nothing is stored.\nNot in the cloud, not local to the device ever. It only shows what was streaming live. In that moment.\nWe both saw you. I admit that. Adrian and I both saw it when I opened the alert and popped the app.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 09:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: All Our Family Memories",
