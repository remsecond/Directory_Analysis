And you\ncan see what accent pieces we have that are unused that I can use so I don’t buy new stuff. I’m not going to push my luck if you are doing me a favor.\nOr it will never happen again.

Civil?\nYou don’t hope someday that we can catch each others glance and remember a tender moment, a special date. I know you did not hate me for 30\nyears, and keep having kids. I know we enjoyed our love making. I also know you saw I was getting better. Changing the man I was to be the man you\nasked me to be. I was all in.\nSo you can have a pov on the bad times. That’s fair. But there is no way you can deny that when you were cold, I kept you warm. When you were\nhungry, I fed you. And when you cried, I held you. If after 30 years as soulmates, the best we can do is civil it will be a wasted life.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 05:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 07:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move",
