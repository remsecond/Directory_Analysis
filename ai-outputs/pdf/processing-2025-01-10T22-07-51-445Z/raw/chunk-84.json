I share you are disrespecting me and my time and just generally being unkind. I\ntell you it's an issue with how you use this platform and ask you to stop.\nNot only do you not stop, you double down. You continue the same disrespectful behavior, and then up it a notch by sending me new questions\nrepeatedly you expect answered. And this while you ignore mine when I ask for an answer.\nAll of this while you are out running around making parental decisions that I have not been a part of because you assumed full custody of our kids,\nafter rejecting the parenting plan and now make all parenting decisions unilaterally.\nI am eager to work with you, but this seems like a perverse joke, with you two sitting around thinking about how to make me look like a fool next. Just\nto see how far you can push my face into the mud so you can laugh at my humiliation.\nIt's honestly just cruel, Christine.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 12:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1061 of 4024\nWhat are you talking about?\nI just spent 2.5 hours with att and xfinity to clean up the accounts.\nHow am I disrespecting your time?\nThe movers are trying to reschedule through no fault of me and you won’t respond to that.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 12:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 12:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This\nMessage 1062 of 4024\nPlease at least read the thread before you respond.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 01:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please Don’t Start Our Day Like This",
