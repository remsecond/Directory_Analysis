  "text": "Message 1407 of 4024\nFirst, because this is the 3rd time I have had to type this up because OFW sucks. But it’s all I have.\nSecond, I have no idea what is going on with my account or the Kirkland Xfinity account now.\nI am getting all sorts of alerts from App Access to Credit Cards. I don't know what security layers you have now or what might have changed. I just\nknow my info is passed around on that network and now I am getting constant warnings and security alerts.\nWe never had this issue before, so I'm bummed it's exploding now. The net is if we can't figure it out, I need to get any of my info that flows through\nyour network removed- Kill Max's long time game account, kill all credit card info, kill and game pass connection.\nAnd frankly, that is just to protect me. You can make your own decisions about what you are prepared to put on that network, from all of the above\nto your confidential emails and even your every keystroke for that matter. You are in the same boat.\nI am not trying to finger-point. I bummed this is happening, but its not your area. I don't expect you to understand. And I am sure that if I did our\ntaxes for the first time and did not allow you to see what I was filing, I'm sure there would be some hiccups as well.\nSo please don't take it personally... but not only is it not getting fixed. It is rapidly getting much worse.\nHope your Japan call went well...\nSent:02/14/2024 at 08:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 08:53 PM)\nSubject:I’m Frustrated\nAttachments:IMG_1401.PNG (1 MB)",
