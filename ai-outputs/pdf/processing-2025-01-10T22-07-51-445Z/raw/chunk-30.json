We both see it. And it hurts to see him this way. His confidence is shaken and his outlook is dim. Given our commitment to\nteamwork on their behalf I'd like to do something quick and bold. We are not going to make things much worse and I'd like to give him a line of sight\nSent:01/31/2024 at 05:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 05:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is AD ok?",
