Will do.\nBy the way, I am really enjoying our new mode of operations. I’m not angry and anxious anymore. I feel like we can do great things again, just in a\ndifferent kind of partnership. That’s the way these things are supposed to go . Thanks again for the thoughtful feedback.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 08:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1211 of 4024\nWow... my favorite pair was $15... they are sweet..\nIt hurts so bad to think about paying Nordy’s $220...\nI’ll just try and be patient.

Given response and turnaround times it might as well be in the next 15 minutes. Can we get that to her?\nAD Questionnaire- I am going to stop errands and focus on finishing that with ICS so I can get it back to you with time for Lori to review if she likes.\nSAAS meeting- Let's appear as healthy and well-adjusted as possible. We can do it here, but I need time to tidy. Obviolhs on best behavior.  Please\nconfirm.\nCourt Filing- Hope we can do this soon. I am in a very uncomfortable state given this is in a live court filing. But I promised patience and will be.\nRestraining Order- Hope we can do this soon. Things that could take 5-10 min. take 5-10 hrs. We always have to scramble. But I promised patience\nand will be.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 12:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 01:03 PM)\nSubject:Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon",
