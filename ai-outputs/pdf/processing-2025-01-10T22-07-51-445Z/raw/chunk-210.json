If you agree, I’d say let’s just stick to simple admin stuff, SAAS, Alki, Beth Check, Unemployment,\nTaxes, Alerts, ADs Arm, Wall Art, Shoot 360, Flag, Unemployment, etc...\nAfter we get a win or two we can tackle some tougher subjects. The most important thing right now is to demonstrate grace and cooperation on the\nBunny Slopes. We will get to the triple blacks when we are good and ready.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 05:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 05:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
