That was a lie.\nBut that is not the point, I’m trying to figure out how you and I work together so I can be a good dad to the boys. Finally, her being a liar is not that\nbig a deal.\nThis is ultimately up to you and I . and I’m trying to understand whether you want to re-litigate all this and I need to go back to my attorney and start\nover or if you and I want to figure out how I can see the boys in a safe and healthy way.\nI’m honestly not having an angry moment, so I hope it doesn’t come across in text that way . I am honestly in sincerely just trying to work with you\non our plan.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1316 of 4024\nI’m going to walk away from this and evaluate my next steps.\nI have tried to work on a parenting plan with you in good faith without involving parent evaluator or GA, despite what it appears to be the best\ncourse.\nI’m not threatening like you but at some point we need to admit it’s not working.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1317 of 4024\nWait, I’m not threatening you at all.\nI am trying to work with you.
