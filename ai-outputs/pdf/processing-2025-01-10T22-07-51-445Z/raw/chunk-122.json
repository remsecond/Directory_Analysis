  "text": "- How We Use:  I'd like to agree here. Last time we paid for advice not adopted. For that matter, if we don't follow her advice, I'm not totally sure why\nwe are going back.\nSo I'll be patient as requested for the first issue. Especially since we are trying to make this issue work with OFW. But I'll continue to ask we resolve Dr\nBrown before engaging.\nThese are sensitive matters that have a huge impact on the remains of what is left of the Moyer family. So I hope that was respectful and constructive.\nIf not, please advise\nI'm still all in, and will continue to be. \n- robert\nMessage 1177 of 4024\nWhat's going on?

I’ll connect with him after.\nIt looks like you are still getting alerts which is frustrating so I’ll need to call them back.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 03:35 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 04:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1180 of 4024\nI’m not sure what you mean. You made it known to Ad about the RO and stated you would never see him again so I’m uncertain about your\ncommunications as well.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 03:36 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 03:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: What are you doing with Elsa?",
