Do we want any of them?\nThere are a pair of expensive flip flops.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 11:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Men’s Clothes\nMessage 1084 of 4024\nSo giving the pictures of me that you held dear and looked at every day for the last day is cruel. I’m going through bags of my whole life, I’m not trying\nto be a dick, but please don’t intentionally rub salt into my wounds. I think we agreed to hold sentimental stuff\nSent:02/04/2024 at 11:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Men’s Clothes\nMessage 1085 of 4024\nI’ll look through the lists we have swapped this AM and try to stack rank things for you. We agree that the front room is pri one so you are functional\nand have peace of mind. Boy, can I ever relate to having a bunch of bags cluttering my space all the time!\nBut this should help you out so you know the things I would want most and the things that can wait a bit. For example, I would want the pellet grill\nover the green egg far and away. The green egg can wait so I will get that list to you before noon,\nOn my end, I will look at the things that I suggested go back to you and just start a couple boxes. We don’t need to do that today, but perhaps we\nswapped them at a basketball practice or something.\nI know you will be busy with work today, and it’s a Monday . So I promise not to be unrealistic about response times here, So I will just do my best if\nyou’re not able to get back to me. There’s nothing life or death going on here that we can’t just course correct.\nPlease do let me know how Adrian is doing. He sounded really bad yesterday. I hope you have a wonderful day and we are productive as a team. Please\nlet me know if there’s anything at all I can do for you and I will do my best to make it happen.\nBest\nrobert\nSent:02/05/2024 at 06:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:41 AM)\nSubject:Good Morning!\nMessage 1086 of 4024\nThank you. I’ll look for the list.\nAdrian staying home. I’m debating if I take him to Dr but it honestly looks like a bad flu so not much they can do.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 07:42 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!",
