I just can’t keep asking the question over and over, day after day, not get reassurance, but continue.\nThanks, Christine. Hope we have better luck on other things!\nMessage 1352 of 4024\nI won’t. We are both navigating. This is not your fault and I appreciate you continuing to let me know. I got an alert a Samsung device connected last\nnight and I have no idea what that was. Frustrating.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:52 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1353 of 4024\nThat is very thoughtful. Thank you for the effort and thinking of me. I really appreciate it. I’ll be on standby\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1354 of 4024\nHis arm is still funky. We had to leave ski early because of it. I would like him to rest it but can ask him tonight his thoughts if he attend practice.\nWhen is AAU tryouts?\nHeading into back to back so I’ll be dark for a bit.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:56 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 09:57 AM)\nSubject:Adrian\nMessage 1355 of 4024\nThank you. That’s all I needed to hear.\nYou think that’s frustrating, imagine a blink alert popping and trying to figure out wtf that’s all about.\nIf you can tell me next time BEFORE you open it, I can help you open it and diagnose a bit more.\nHappy to help any way I can. These things have pretty much ruined my life.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 09:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 10:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts",
