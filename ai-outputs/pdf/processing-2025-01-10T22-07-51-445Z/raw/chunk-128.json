  "text": "Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n[ I will add this will impact the parenting plan as it impacted me greatly, on how I navigate these situations, and how you and I communicate. This\nraised a level of fear for me, trauma and trust. ]\n<<I agree with you, and I think we leave it up to her on the parenting plan. That is why we are going. It is not a goal, however. This point should\ncome out in the discussion. We have competing perspectives, and that is what we are trying to navigate. Not just your scenario where you are 100%\nright. Our goal is peaceful and constructive communication through conflict and disagreement in order to be a better parenting team. >>\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nwe handled it.\n[I believe Elsa has a perspective to share. Dr. Brown actually thought it would be helpful to discuss with her last time, but I did not push it.]\n<<This incident did not happen last time. If we want Elsa to discuss a parenting plan, we choose the appropriate time and place not squeeze her into\nthis agenda. It was clear in our argument she had limited 2nd hand info on what happened driving her conclusions. I trust Elsa 100% when she has all\nthe right data, but she does not. I also saw this when she attacked me for our swinging days and the relationship you had with Kevin. Limited data,\nbad conclusions>>\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns. .\n<<Agree>>\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting\nplan if necessary.\n<<Agree>>\n- How We Use: I'd like to agree here. Last time we paid for advice not adopted. For that matter, if we don't follow her advice, I'm not totally sure why\nwe are going back.\n[We did adopt most aspects of it. I disagreed with the overnight on Wednesday.]\n<<What we did and did not agree to last time is an unproductive rabbit hole. What are we going to use her advice for this time? Is it just another\nChinese menu where we choose what we want and ignore what we don't? That said, I think a regular check-in every ??? weeks holds us both\naccountable and allows us to course correct (just like now) Love to have Elsa go next time in a more general family update. I don't see a downside to\nthe arrangement>>\nMessage 1198 of 4024\nPlease see your phone if this is jacked up.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 09:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 09:23 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",
