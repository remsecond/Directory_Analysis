  "text": "Front room first! Peace of mind!!! You'll get list before lunch.\nCan't use dresser right now the room has too many bikes, thanks!\nGetting through garbage bags this AM. The goodwill pile is getting big.\nThank you again for all the work you did on your end to help us out!!!\nElsa and I are not in a good place. She went off on me like she did when she blamed you for missing her flight. Including how I (this time) have ruined\nher entire life, still look at her phone records, and have always wanted to ruin her.\nNot fighting but finding out you two have been working together on the story (including her talking to her \"Blink Friends\") without hearing anything\nfrom me, yelling I have never apologized when I had, etc.. sets us both up for failure.\nIf she was going to be involved, it would be better to transparently let her be involved. I don't want to digress at all and want to stay focused, but the\nElsa situation may be lifelong. I don't anticipate participating in her wedding at this stage.\nLet's stick to the move...\nMessage 1091 of 4024\nOk. I’ll look for list. He could do two trips too. Perhaps bring my bike back and whatever else you want sent back the load up again.\nIt might be helpful for both of us to just get it done and focus on the bigger things.\nI’ll start the Ravenna application today.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!\nMessage 1092 of 4024\nAwesome... thanks for the focus on Ravenna.\nI was hoping she would come back to us and say it’s not necessary since we just did it. But since that did not happen, I’m optimistic that you can use a\nlot of the material and cut and paste.\nI am not quite sure what you meant by “it might be helpful for us both to just get it done and focus on the bigger things” but if I am missing\nsomething, I’m happy to accommodate.\nhere is to a productive day of teamwork.\nThanks!!\nSent:02/05/2024 at 08:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Good Morning!",
