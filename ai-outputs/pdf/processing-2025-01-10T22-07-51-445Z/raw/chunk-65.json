  "text": "Message 986 of 4024\nAgree it’s not helpful. I asked for a way we could talk about what we want from Dr. Brown and how we propose to do it. That is after all what we\nagreed to.\nSo you can step away if you like. That makes sense. Because you’re actually not answering my questions. And in fact, you just turned to attacking me\ninstead.\nYour quote below is funny about not responding to asks. Please read any of your responses and let me know a single question of mine you answered.\nI actually don’t think there’s any reason to regroup if you are not going to answer any of my questions and instead just insult me and attack me. It’s\nnot helpful.\nAre we working together with Dr. Brown or not? Do I have any say in what we are trying to accomplish with our children or are you the sole decision-\nmaker?\nYou just keep asking if the date works.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 06:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD\nMessage 987 of 4024\nOk.. thought we needed to close on move next, but you have signaled (as always) if we need to entertain anything you don’t suggest, you just hang up.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 06:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW\nMessage 988 of 4024\nI did not see a reply. And you stepped away after confirming we would work on this.\nIt's super frustrating to still be doing this with you after having my place for almost a month now. I know we both agreed to work together this week\nbecause it is taking a toll on everyone but here we are again. Not a single thing accomplished on the move. Zero. And I handled Alki for us.\nEver notice that when I do this, it always gets done? And we even make additional, accommodating trips happen on the fly? I don't get why this is so\nhard, and I fully expect you to come back at me next week with more threats of sending my stuff to storage, yet again.\nLike a successful marriage, this takes two. Hmmm... is there a pattern?\nOr did you just play a very clever, real-life Groundhog Day joke on me.\nSee ya at the keyboard next week!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 06:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items",
