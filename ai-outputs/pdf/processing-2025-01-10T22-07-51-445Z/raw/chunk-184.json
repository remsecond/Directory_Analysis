  "text": "Message 1379 of 4024\nOf course... may I kindly suggest an agenda for Sat?\n- Meet at Bellevue Starbucks for Decaf- 5:00 pm\n- Stroll the Bellevue consignment store- 5:15-5:45 pm\n- Visit the “Boy Crib” to get you thoughts- 6:00 pm\n- Allow me to prepare a yummy menu- 6:15 pm\n- Eat delicious food made with love- 6:45 pm\n- Discuss big picture or line items- 7:00 pm\nThis allows us to slowly, gently, ease into our discussion in a constructive and respectful way. Establish an amicable report, while not being forced\ninto the ring, bloodied with backs against the wall.\nIf you feel threatened or I am being unreasonable, you bail. Just like you can hang up or block me. I am strongly incentivized to make this singular\nopportunity work, lest we keep this up for months on end.\nBut... before you say “no” again, please reflect on the status quo, its impact on all of us, and consider that we will never break the cycle till we make an\neffort to break the cycle. Again, we are living a catch 22.\nSo I ask this one time, and perhaps the only time since our anniversary before you left for home, that you will allow me to, not manipulate you, but\ninstead offer a different solution than what’s not working.\nPlease put your sword and shield aside. Rearrange plans as I will do, and make this our singular priority for a couple of hours on the singular date/time\nyou are not all consumed with competing priorities.\nYou’re still in control, but relax and enjoy the ride...\nTake a chance. You won’t be disappointed you did.\n- robert\nSent:02/14/2024 at 09:07 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 10:09 AM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!\nMessage 1380 of 4024\nI sent you an email a while back with specific details and the link to add the mandatory code that you download and add to your wallet. As noted, if I\nam not driving, it is critical you do that. All hell breaks loose and mayhem and weeks of resorting happens if you don’t. It’s not pretty...\nDate info in the pic. If I’m allowed to forward relevant childcare “fyi” emails I’ll be happy to share info. But since it would violate the RO, I’ll sit on\nthis along with the other items I have now. Please also note we unfortunately can’t have a shared calendar anymore. That requires email invites, not\npermitted.\nFWIW- I know you and I were making progress on a lot of these common sense, no harm ways to coordinate our children and asset planning. You\nspoke to Anna Lisa and it felt like common sense left the building. I respect you get very defensive of her, but the things she does confounds me\nSent:02/14/2024 at 10:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 10:44 AM)\nSubject:AAU\nAttachments:IMG_1373.PNG (2 MB)",
