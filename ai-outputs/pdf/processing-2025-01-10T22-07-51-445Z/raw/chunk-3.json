But\nwe don’t answer each other’s questions or respond when the question asked was answered.\nI am not trying to insult you. It is not a knock. But if this is the singular way we are going to communicate about a single topic, I guess I should\ncalibrate my expectations. If i am doing this wrong, please let me know so we can be more effective.\nDo you mind letting me know the Canada agenda since it is an international trip? Just for peace of mind.\nIf this is how it’s going to work, or not, and this is actually the “fast track” may I please ask for a possible path forward that will get us back to\nMonday?\nI assure you that I understand your concerns and will not cross your boundaries again if given the opportunity to collaborate better again.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 09:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nAttachments:IMG_1069.PNG (1 MB)\nMessage 825 of 4024\nI will work through Lisa. We have a com from Hinano.\nI hope it is ok to give a heads up here. If not, please advise and I assure you it will never be repeated.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 05:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 09:45 PM)\nSubject:Alki\nMessage 826 of 4024\nSo... I know this is after hours. But you have some precious cargo. Mind letting me know when he arrives safely? I love him, and his driver more than\nlife itself.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 08:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 09:46 PM)\nSubject:Safe Arrival\nMessage 827 of 4024\nThank you for the email.\nI thought I had shared but we are in Canada now and plan to return Sunday night. Max is at Lisa’s for the evenings and will manage his way\nhomebodies and Ski over the weekend.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 09:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>",
