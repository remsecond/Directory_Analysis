Please cut and paste this link into a browser because OFW won't support links... Also,\nsee attached for things I can explain to you.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqGo_6HunBE\nWe are fighting over things I can show you with your own eyes. This means everything. Cams, Wi-Fi, Phones... We're at each other's throats and don't\nneed to be. I can answer your questions. Not just you, but the kids too. If we pause, I really can just demonstrate EVERY single thing I have said\nPlease consider it. Let's take control back..\nSent:02/01/2024 at 04:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/05/2024 at 11:26 PM)\nSubject:As We Discussed\nAttachments:Xfinity_Features.jpg (105 KB)\nXfinity_Overview.jpg (218 KB)\nMessage 930 of 4024\nYou can see the times they were thrown in the pic.

Anyway, I’m here for ya if I can help debug at all. For that matter I can meet you there, let\nthem fix and test on the spot. Then we know it’s resolved.\nSent:02/01/2024 at 06:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:59 AM)\nSubject:If this helps...\nAttachments:IMG_1218.PNG (290 KB)",
