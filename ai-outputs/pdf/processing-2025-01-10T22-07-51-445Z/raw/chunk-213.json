It’s like a f’d up game.\nYou say “thanks, I appreciate it, we want peace, I’ll be back, thanks for your patience”\nPlease stand firm on your words instead. Don’t turn this into a power trip. I’m trying to work with you.\nPlease try, Christine. This is not working\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:10 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1473 of 4024\nOk.  But you realize you say no after you haven said yes all week. It’s fucked up. It really is.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1474 of 4024\nPlease see below. Can you stand firm on this instead?\nWhy is it ok for your words and commitment to mean nothing to you? It’s just weird you think that is taking a stand, for something good and\nmeaningful. All it means is I can’t trust you. You never follow through. Ever. You say you will, then don’t. What’s up?\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!\nMessage 1475 of 4024\nBelow is an interesting read on what you have done to me. But I'm sure you knew beforehand.\nIt feels like you knowingly committed something that is an absolute lie to the public record. You know I never have beaten you or my kids. But for the\nrest of my life, I will carry the burden of the lies you committed to the public record. I know, it's my fault, your life and the beautiful, smart,\naccomplished, compassionate young men are my fault. I ruined you, them, and made you lie.",
