  "text": "into normalcy again. Perhaps even what we can look like as a mature family embracing the next chapter and reassuring him it will be even better than\nthe last. That is why we are doing this after all, and thus far it's a promise not kept.\nSo this is the 911 call AD deserves right now. He needs to see we are listening to him, and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most\nimportantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life. When he needs us, we will drop anything:  appointments,\nschedules, our problems, for him. We put our differences aside and find one voice between us, as it should be when he needs us most.\nProposing you and I do the following:\nWe try and meet AD where he is, and you even serve as gentle training wheels for us\n- I call him tomorrow and say we should all get together to discuss the SAAS option\n- I ask if I could come grab him after school Friday to help clean up for a big family meeting\n- I pick him up wearing the Homer Simpson shirt he got and a new Nike Tech replacement.\n- We go to my place and I show him the progress on all his ideas at the place he picked out\n- We decide on a to-do list of home improvements to make it shine before the SAAS summit.\nNow it's his day! He is number one and sees it in action. He has a gentle re-entry with Dad as we work on a todo list and we can talk about where he is\nat. We get things in order and prepare for Mom!!! Now this is something he never thought that could happen last Monday.\n- When you arrive, AD gives you a tour of the place that he picked out and shows off.\n- Mom let's him know how pleased and proud of him she is and that he has great ideas.\n- We make some popcorn and serve some drinks and he can play host a bit for Mom\n- Then we talk about SAAS. largely info we know already, but he has a voice to hear\n- We make some foregone conclusions, but he feels like he is driving the decisions\n- We can even play a game of ping pong to feel normal again for once since July\nAfterward, Dad can serve juicy steaks or Mom and AD head back to Kirkland. Ad knows he is first in our lives and has confidence after seeing us\ntogether that there is no more \"lost in our mess\" he feels today.\nIf we can please do this, and put our issues aside, I assure you this could be a game changer on so many levels and possibly accelerate some of the\nhealing even before we get in front of the shrinks!\nIt is so important right now that he sees Mom and Dad do what was impossible before. He will go home happy, with hope. It won't solve everything\nnor diminish the hard work ahead. But, for a night, he sees anything is possible and perhaps this new life might not be so bad after all.\nRemember, I proposed to you to get you back into the Family Photos and we spent the last 29 years together raising three wonderful kids. I hope you\nwill trust me on this one too!\nPlease don't say no...\nMessage 887 of 4024\nThank you for the detailed proposal below.\nI agree we need to act soon on Ad.\nWhat I need to navigate is the recent serious breach in trust and faith that occurred. The proposal is in my view is putting that aside and not\nSent:01/31/2024 at 06:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 06:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is AD ok?",
