  "text": "is consistent with the purpose of a restraining order, which is to protect one party from the actions of another. However, the protected person is\ntypically not prevented from contacting the restrained person unless they also have a restraining order against them or there are specific court orders\nto that effect.\nIf both parties need or want to modify the communication terms of the RO—for example, to allow more flexibility or to impose certain restrictions\non the protected person as well—it's essential to do so through the court. Any changes to the terms of a restraining order must be approved by a judge\nto be legally enforceable.\nIn any situation involving a restraining order, consulting with a legal professional can provide guidance tailored to the specifics of the case, including\nany questions about communication rights and restrictions for both parties.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 02:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
