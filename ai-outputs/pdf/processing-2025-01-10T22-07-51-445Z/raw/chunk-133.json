  "text": "Thanks!\nMessage 1213 of 4024\nThe update with ICS included now is in your inbox. Please let me know if you I can help carry the load in any other way... I am assuming we can do\nthe meeting from the same cam together (it looks lame if the parents can't make that effort. We would have for the in-person meeting we wanted).\nSince the RO says Kirland is a No No, we can do it here. I'll have things tested ahead of time and ask her for the link today. I'll dress casually but nice.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 01:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Saas meeting\nMessage 1214 of 4024\nJust some feedback, but some of this whole move thing is just mean. We don't have any idea who will end up where. Based on the last agreement we\nhad, I was going to be in the house- after I even offered to try and keep you there, but you refused.\nAnd so much of this is junk. Stuff we should have done together when we both left the house. Now it fills three rooms, including the bedroom I had\nhoped to make special for Max. That was super important to me. And now I can't even do that.\nAnd then, some of the special things. Things that mean a lot to me are broken or f'd\n- The \"Microsoft\" clay sculpture Elsa gave me 20 years ago\n- The Allen field house floor I laid Adrian on when he was born\n- Poppa's bible is all taken apart so I'll never know how he had it\n- I can go on but won't\nAnd then there are things I *thought* were us. Special things that I hoped we would wait to divvy up. It's all just thrown like trash in a bag.\nWe are trying to be kinder and accepting, and that's the most important thing now. But I needed to say something because this feels so rude.\n- robert\nSent:02/08/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 01:04 PM)\nSubject:My Stuff\nMessage 1215 of 4024\nLet me get back to this.
