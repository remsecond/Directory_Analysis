We are definitely into late afternoon and rounding the corner to evening pretty soon. Just trying to coordinate myself.\nI also appreciate the conversation earlier. You are asking all the questions. But some of the details are getting mixed up. I am happy to help explain.\nI understand this may be too emotional for you to even entertain however and will respect that as well. I’m just trying to show you what happened,\nwhen.\nAnd to be sure that you know, because I keep saying it but it doesn’t seem to register- I had access, it invaded your privacy, and should’ve informed\nyou\n“Christine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of\nyour personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry”\nI don’t know how to say sorry other than say “I am truly sorry.” I made that clear weeks ago. You wanted it to go through lawyers, so I did that too. I’\nm trying.\nEither way, I promised to work with you constructively after my tone issue, and I assure you that is a promise I will keep.\nSent:02/03/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg Tip\nMessage 1018 of 4024\nWe missed each other in flight. Thanks for the update.\nReally bummed for Adrian. Sick and hurt really sucks!\nSent:02/03/2024 at 05:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 05:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg Tip",
