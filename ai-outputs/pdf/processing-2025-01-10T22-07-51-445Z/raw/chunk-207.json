  "text": "Message 1447 of 4024\nIt’s not an intentional poke.\nYou write very long emails and if I just respond with an ok, I get criticized, if I don’t respond immediately because it deserves a more thoughtful\napproach I get criticized.\nI just don’t have the same cycles as you. And some nights I fall asleep after multiple long days.\nIt’s a no win for me and you weaponize it.\nLook at the number of emails today. I  started my work day a few hours ago and your expectation is I devote unlimited mind share to this.\nBack and forth takes away. You even it said it yourself. How are you expected to do a full time job in this situation. I do. I have global responsibility\nfor a multi national corporation. I know you have never taken that seriously or understand the full scope of what I own and manage, based on your\nactions and just expecting me to cope and clean up and time shift and deal\nWith the craziness that is inserted into my life.\nMilan was a prime example of full day meetings, managing the US as they logged in the emea afternoon, juggling multiple audits in us, Asia and\nEurope, while a colleague was out for an emergency, and insisting I spend hours and hours on the phone with  you and texts and email\ncommunications. That is documented in your emails, calls and texts. You have complete disregard for your impact to others. It’s just about you. I\nspecifically told you the general manager of the roastery is watching me as I begged to get off the phone to do my job and you insisted I stay on for 1.5\nhours. The office was deserted when we wrapped except for her and I.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 10:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 10:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th\nMessage 1448 of 4024\nNope.
