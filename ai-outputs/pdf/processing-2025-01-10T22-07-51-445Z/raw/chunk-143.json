It will help with the ovearll accounting and help us to understand when we are at the \"buy\ninstead of give back point\" for us both.\nThanks...\nMessage 1248 of 4024\nIt’s a Zoom call. I still believe it reflects better on us to be in the same room. Appearance matters when you are trying to make a good impression to\nask a favor.\nMy offer still stands. The place may be a bit cluttered as I was not planning on it. But I promise we’ll have an attractive set up with a nice background.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 09:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 10:24 AM)\nSubject:AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1249 of 4024\nThank you for the invitation. I will politely decline and am looking forward to the discussion with the Lori.\nI have got a good start on transcripts, both requested and have reached out to his prior teacher at Lakeview. I am working on identifying a current\nteacher at ICS.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 10:26 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 10:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1250 of 4024\nCan I ask why you won’t do this?\nIt really does reflect better on us as a family. And if there are any yellow flags later, they won’t look back on it and think “ yeah now that I think about\nit, they were kinda weird, I wonder if their home life is the real issue”\nLet’s just be civil for a good cause. It’s good all around.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 10:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 10:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting\nMessage 1251 of 4024\nIf you think that I am trying to manipulate you I want to be transparent. Yes! I want to find a great cause that will help Adrian. AND give you and me\none ever so small victory where we can reflect that we worked together. As a team to do something good.\nAs soon as you shared the questions, I wrote back immediately and said I would do it. I had it done in an hour, and I thought it was pretty good.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 10:46 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 10:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s SAAS Meeting",
