  "text": "Message 1376 of 4024\nI think this is devolving into a fight. I have no interest in that. I don't care to refute or discuss a point-by-point rebuttal. My commitment to peaceful\nand constructive communication stands.\nI want to acknowledge what you are saying below. Every point. In fact, I am trying very hard to discuss them with you so acrimony does not fester\nand deepen by swapping arrows on OFW.\nI appreciate your perspective and hope you honor mine by finding time to discuss these for the greater good. But that is not happening. And there is\nneither a path forward nor progress.\nI would love, love, love to help you share your burden. We can talk and discuss what that would need to look like. But not allowing that to happen\neffectively eliminates all chance of that.\nIt is said that \"Amidst the storm of disagreement, the gentle breeze of kind and constructive communication navigates us towards the shores of\nresolution.\" I am asking you to give it a shot.\nYours in kindness\n- robert\nSent:02/14/2024 at 07:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 08:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!\nMessage 1377 of 4024\nIt's all good... I missed you in flight.\nYou are probably having another hard day. Did not take my email in the way it was meant to land and have a ton of plates spinning.\nI appreciate your apology, but no offense was taken. You are doing the best that you know how to do given tough circumstances.\nHave a great day, Christine.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 08:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!\nMessage 1378 of 4024\nThis has been traumatic to both of us in very different ways. I acknowledge that your experience is different from mine. Both of us want peace.\nI’ll come back to this thread this afternoon with a suggested time to connect. My margins are so tight, as you know how I schedule my life, that these\nthreads and discussion introduce an element of unpredictability of time, then throw me into a state of despair and disarray that messes up my progress\nand trajectory on many aspects. That’s why I am always wary and easier to just push to later, and not let it ruin my day.\nI appreciate your patience.\nSent:02/14/2024 at 08:37 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 08:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Happy Valentine's Day!",
