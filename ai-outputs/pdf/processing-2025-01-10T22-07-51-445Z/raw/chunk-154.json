I want to demonstrate  I support him and be in his corner. I don’t want this to be an “All Mom” thing.\nWe agreed to do this together. When he is present, let’s do it together. We can accommodate for him.\nYou will not be alone with me. Let’s show him that when he is involved, we put our adult stuff aside.\nThanks!\nSent:02/10/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 01:07 PM)\nSubject:It is a gorgeous day\nMessage 1293 of 4024\nYes at ICS.
