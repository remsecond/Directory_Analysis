I don’t want it stuck in your car. It’s way too heavy for you to move. I’ll help all I can, and assure you\nwill feel safe.\nPlease don’t worry about remotes. I got you Universal Samsungs. So yours will work on either, so will mine. So let’s just swap TVs.\nSpeaking of remotes, I had shared a picture of the light switch remote that did not come over with the actual switcher. I’d love that if you were able to\nfind.\nSent:02/03/2024 at 06:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg Tip\nMessage 997 of 4024\nThis is OFW... so still RO compliant.\nI assume Anna Lisa has not gotten back to you. It’s limited to 45 minutes a month. It’s a baby step but still incremental towards normalcy. It would\nalso ease some of my anxiety. Want to try it out to see if it helps us?\nAnd not today of course... lol\nSent:02/03/2024 at 07:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Safe Communication\nAttachments:IMG_1249.PNG (230 KB)\nMessage 998 of 4024\nHis arm will be hurting this morning.
