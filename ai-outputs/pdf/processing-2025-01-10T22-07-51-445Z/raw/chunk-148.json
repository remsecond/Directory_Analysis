I would like to get to a place where it does not happen again. You can blame me, blame me\nfor everything. I intentionally destroyed us.\nYou can say that there was nothing I contributed to who and what this beautiful family is and was. That is fine. But at this point, please don’t deny\nme the opportunity to make things right.\nI am and have been sober. I am and have been interested in making a positive impact in his and other young men’s lives. I don’t preach, I live it.\nCutting me out is not going to help them or us.\nI will be patient however. I will wait for Dr Brown. But please, give me the opportunity to show you I am a different person. I don’t want to say it. I\nneed to be able to show you in real time.\nPlease don’t throw venom back. I am trying hard and people can change. Especially when the stakes are this high. Anyone has the capacity to\nrehabilitate if it’s important. I’m doing that now.\nLet me show you...\nSent:02/09/2024 at 07:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 08:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Give me a ring if you have a second",
