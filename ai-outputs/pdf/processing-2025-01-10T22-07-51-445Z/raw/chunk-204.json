  "text": "We both knew we were getting a divorce, but we were still kind to each other. We still recognized each other and our positive role in our kids' lives.\nBut something really came off the rails fast and hard when others started telling us what we “should be doing”\nAnd our response has been a self-fulfilling spiral of increased animosity to the point where we can't even imagine being kind anymore. I mentioned I\nam taking a step back and trying to operate differently. I want to start with civility and work our way back to mental health. I hope you can take a\nbreath and pause as well in both of our best interests, but fear that may come across as controlling you.\nI'm going to continue to try either way. I hope you will too. Wishing you the best, Christine.\nMessage 1440 of 4024\nIf you are in counseling my hope is that they are helping you see what I’m trying to do is in best interest of my emotional mental and physical health\nand that of kids.\nThe impact to you I can’t help, and are consequences of your direct actions.\nMy objective is not to destroy you as you state below. The continuing blame on me for how you feel and situation is incredible. You have control of\nyour actions.\nIf you have decided you can’t look for gainful employment, that is a choice you have made. The relationship with Max is a direct consequence of your\ninteractions with him. I can go on. Putting blame on me for your situation is again a choice you are making.\nA theme that has been recurring in your life has been its always someone else’s fault for your woes and resulting behavior that results, your\nupbringing, your mom, your dad, your boss, the therapists, and now you have trained it squarely on me as the reason for all things bad.\nIt’s certainly one way to go through life if that’s worked for you. The past 25 years, I pushed forward inspite of what was happening. I could have\neasily taken the same approach but I didn’t.  I’m going to continue that approach but have also pivoted to not accept actions towards me that are\ncompletely unacceptable and will not sweep things under the rug. That did not serve me well and I finally woke up to that.\nActions have consequences which you have never fully felt, and are understandably jarred that you are being held accountable.\nEverything that took a turn was a result of some action taken. Perhaps that is the connection you are not making. What was the action that caused the\nreaction? Things just don’t happen out of the blue.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 08:02 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 08:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th\nMessage 1441 of 4024\nIt’s really ironic, right? You ignore the entire email and tell me I’m all about blaming other people. As you of course blame me for all this. Your entire\nlife.\nSometimes I’m surprised at the absolute hypocrisy of your life and philosophy, but I shouldn’t be. It’s so consistent it should never surprise me.\nAnd no, this did happen out of the blue. You might have had an epiphany but a successful married is about communication. You just bailed.\nYou left a man behind. No note of KO either, huh?\nSent:02/16/2024 at 08:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 08:09 AM)\nSubject:Re: From Dec 11th",
