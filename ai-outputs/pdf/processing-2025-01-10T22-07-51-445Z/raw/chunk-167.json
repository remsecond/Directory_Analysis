  "text": "My hope is we will give this one shot to have a talk, never to be repeated if it does not work. My aspiration is it will work, we show grace, resolve our\nissues, and establish a blueprint for success.\nI’m honestly, and sincerely trying to work with you, Christine. This is not an attempt to manipulate you. It is trying to dig us out of our hole, resolve\nbig issues, and move forward peacefully with less expense.\nThanks for your thoughtful consideration...\n-robert\nMessage 1334 of 4024\nThank you for the peaceful note.\nPlease start with list on OFW. The RO must be respected so I anticipate that’s on your list too.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 12:54 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 02:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1335 of 4024\nOf course. I want to do the right thing and so do you. I am happy to start the list here as asked.\nHere is what the RO says now:\n- The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as\nspecifically permitted, below:\n- The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard\nsolely for the purpose of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding\nmanagement of shared assets.\n- The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in\ncommunications with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or\nmanaging the parties’ shared assets.\nAs I read this, you have no restrictions on communicating with me. The RO just limits how I contact you.  It also does not prohibit face-to-face\ninteractions- school events, sports, or a constructive discussion walk or coffee.\nDo you read the text above the same way? I just want to be sure we are on the same page before I spend a considerable amount of time documenting\neverything with the expectation that we will resolve anything on OFW again.\nMy fear is that will lead to the same frustration that inspired this ask. My hope is you will exercise your rights so we can work together instead of going\nin a circle by kicking off another round of what has always failed as noted below.\nI will start the list and share it here. May I also ask you let me know if you will consider my proposal for a one-time, peaceful and constructive all-up\nSent:02/12/2024 at 02:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 02:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base",
