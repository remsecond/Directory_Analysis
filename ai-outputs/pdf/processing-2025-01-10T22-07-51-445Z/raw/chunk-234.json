I’m in the middle of a pretty drive. So naturally, the mind wanders a little bit. I’m just thinking how weird it is, but for 25 years you put\nyour head on my chest, you called me big, and you would get so sad and look at me with those beautiful big brown eyes and I know it’s gonna happen\nsomeday, but I can’t imagine my life without you. And how much I miss you.and it’s just so odd to think that won’t be the case. You won’t miss me. I\ndon’t think you’ll celebrate, but I don’t think you’ll be sad.\nSent:02/18/2024 at 10:30 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/18/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:When I Die...\nMessage 1499 of 4024\nSorry for the bad punctuation. I’m using voice and did not put “quotes” around the part you would say to me. Bit perhaps you recognize those words\nand remember that it was you, so it doesn’t matter..\nSent:02/18/2024 at 10:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/18/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: When I Die...\nMessage 1500 of 4024\nIt’s also very funny to me, but even though this is the only way we can communicate, I’m usually typing you a message while you’re typing me a\nmessage. And that’s you checking in only twice a day.. We still share this crazy, innate synchronization with each other. it was always uncanny, but\nnow it’s even more mystical.\nSent:02/18/2024 at 10:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/18/2024 at 04:50 PM)\nSubject:Our internal clock...\nMessage 1501 of 4024\nI think it’s unfair that I can’t see him before he goes on a trip tomorrow that could be dangerous. I know he will come home safe. But I’m sure\nMichael Schumacher felt the same way. Sorry, it bums me out.\nSent:02/18/2024 at 07:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/18/2024 at 07:29 PM)\nSubject:Max",
