Every time I think we have a foothold it gives\nway. I'm sure you are frustrated as well.\nSoooo...\n- Thanks for working on finding on a safe alternative for us on Running List items.\n- I hope you'll reconsider, and we put AD first and we address our stuff separately\n- I'll take you up on your offer to share where I said no to Dr Brown so I can explain\nThanks!\nSent:01/31/2024 at 07:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 07:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is AD ok?\nMessage 893 of 4024\nI’ll reach out to Dr. Brown tomorrow and include you to kick it off.\nI’ll let you know once I align with lawyer on proposal to address Ad and running item list.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 07:34 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 07:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Is AD ok?\nMessage 894 of 4024\nThank you on both counts!\nIf you won’t consider my idea for AD, I’m open to yours as well.
