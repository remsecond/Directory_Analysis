I can show you. I have offered tens of times. I can actually show you with your own eyes. In real life. You have questions, let’s\nanswer them. We don’t need to fight at all.\nWhat is Dr Brown sorting out? We definitely agreed we would work together on what we wanted and how we would go about it. Is that still the plan\nor has this moved to unilateral decisions and direction?\nOn both counts, I am sincerely trying to coordinate and cooperate with you. But I honestly don’t think you are open to anything I say. Can we work\ntogether on our kids issues or are you sole decision maker?\nHoping its the former\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD\nMessage 984 of 4024\nOk.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:35 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spring Break/Cabo\nMessage 985 of 4024\nLet’s pause in this. It’s not helpful right now.,\nI have asked to move forward and respond to Dr Brown a few times today for times in email and here and I haven’t seen response so I’ll just step away\nfor now.\nI honestly feel sometimes you don’t respond to masks to continue the conversation.\nI’m going to step away and regroup tomorrow\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD",
