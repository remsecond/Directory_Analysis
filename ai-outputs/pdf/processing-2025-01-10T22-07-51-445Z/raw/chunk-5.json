  "text": "Message 831 of 4024\nI just recognized what I find difficult about your emails. The ask is often buried in a long discussion of complaints and feelings. The list below is\nhelpful as I can see exactly what is outstanding, but when surrounded by extra words that are unhelpful, the focus moves away.\nAsk for future emails to be concise about ask without superfluous language.\nRO language. I’ll need to review. I assume you discussed with lawyer and agreed to content,\nDr. Brown. I suggested to reach out and request engagement to assist on how to navigate this situation, with her individual speaking with You, myself,\nAdrian and Elsa. I disagree what was in The letter for how we use her reccomendations as it should be for guidance only, and my lawyer will respond\nto Lisa.\nRunning list discussion. I am not comfortable with a call at this time.\nPath to normalization is with assistance of Dr. Brown.\nBofA account. It is a joint account as I understand we both access. You were to set up your own account. I have not seen boys money from Beth\ndeposited into their accounts but I assumed you cashed, paid off credit card for Bend bills (700 flight charge was actually booked to my Amex as your\ndelta account defaulted to my Amex which has now been updated) and were going to transfer money to boys account for their Christmas gifts.\nI could not time discovery of cameras and subsequent steps I need to take to ensure safety. I don’t control your actions that needed to be address. It’s\nunfortunate Lisa is unavailable to help you navigate. .\nSAAS we had discussions you would reach out and apparently told Adrian you had. When he told me you had and asked about response that’s when\nI started asking you and you never responded. I have not reached out to Jonathan yet but plan to do so so he has an email Monday am. If you disagree\nlet me know and proposed next steps\nXfinity. Noted you have confirmed alerts have stopped. If they reappear my expectation is that you will inform me. I will ask my lawyer to formalize\nthat request to Lisa.\nGoing to engage with the group now and enjoy whistler.\nHope the basketball game goes well. I’m sure Joe and team is grateful for you to step in.\n.\nSent:01/27/2024 at 07:40 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/27/2024 at 10:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 832 of 4024\nIt’s the only way I am allowed to communicate with Mom so wanted to check.\nSent:01/28/2024 at 02:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Adrian Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nMax Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Do you guys get these?",
