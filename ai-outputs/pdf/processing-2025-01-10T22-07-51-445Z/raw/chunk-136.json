I thought we had aligned. And given we are five working hours before they chat,\nI think I was pretty clear that we needed urgency now (see subject line.) When did you plan to align if we were not already? We tried that last night.\nHappy to chat more, but for now I will remain positive and constructive as promised. I did nothing in my mind that was either nefarious or meant ill-\nintent. I am trying my best on all fronts to help even as I am a child abuser to the courts likely to do it again. Not sure what you were expecting.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon\nMessage 1226 of 4024\nLet’s just both walk away from this for now.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon\nMessage 1227 of 4024\nShe does have a perspective. Based on a non-witness, non parent, and limited information. Remember she screamed at me for never apologizing to\nyou. I sent my apology three weeks ago. Is she qualified to give her opinion when she has no idea what the heck is going on?\nI'll note that she also laid into me about screwing other women when we were married. She has no idea that started when you were 18 in Hong Kong,\nwe both participated and enjoyed it, but she only knows your side. Then there is her take on Kevin Otero and what you two did together.\nI trust Elsa to make smart decisions and contribute constructively. She just needs the full and accurate picture. Otherwise, she will jump to incorrect\nconclusions and be very opinionated. That feels like a commonsense requirement to provide testimony. How else would she be helpful?\nSent:02/08/2024 at 04:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",
