  "text": "Message 1081 of 4024\nFor below to happen there cannot be the volatility in behavior and pendulum swings.\nWhat you are speaking of below is achievable for individuals who are interacting in a normal manner, consistently.\nMy interactions with you over the last 7 months have been at many times frightening, scary, volatile. You are asking me to revert back to behavior in\nthe marriage where I pretend things did not happen, brush it off, act happy, and not hold you accountable. That has stoped. I recognize my feelings\nand impact and do not just move on. As I process each scary or volatile interaction in a manner that it deserves, and they continue or escalate, it\ncompounds and gets worse as there is no recognition that you don’t start back at zero each time. It is still in a deficit that keeps getting worse. This\nbehavior and reaction from me and family is what you do not recognize, which is holding you firmly accountable each time. It does not reset at zero\nlike it did in the past.\nThe past 7 months does not demonstrate that is the path we are on.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 08:37 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 08:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move\nMessage 1082 of 4024\nI want to thank you for this. It took time, you put thought into it, and it all makes perfect sense to me. I will not justify my reaction to our situation\nbut I always have held firm that V Little on June 30th would be proud that I was fighting Christine of July 5th. That I would do anything to save our\nmarriage and keep our family together, fending off anyone who would destroy it. And that’s what I see happening.\nThat misses the point entirely. I do think she would appreciate me fighting to learn, heal, and have a better, stronger rebirth that puts us on course for\nforever. But what I am missing is the way I’m doing it is the entire reason we are here. The thought is noble, the execution is destructive. It’s like a\nChinese finger trap, the harder I fight and struggle, the worse it gets for us both. She would not like that at all.\nIf I continue the swings, the volatility, the madness, after you made yourself clear tonight in a very thoughtful way, I deserve to never walk down that\npath with you. Alternatively, if I show you I listened, like I had listened this spring, and work on myself for the sake of us, I hope it has a better ending.\nI realize I have reverted, I thought about it tonight. But I can get back on the right path again. I will show you.\nSo thank you for the honest feedback. And while it would have been great to hear in June, I do hear it now and I am acknowledging it. I’ll let my\nactions do the talking and hope for the best. Both the June 30th and July 5th, Christine’s would want that.\nI truly love you, Christine...\nforever yours,\nrobert\nSent:02/04/2024 at 08:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Move",
