  "text": "May we please agree on even that?\nMessage 979 of 4024\nIf we can do this over the weekend, it really sets us up for success with Dr Brown I think. I’d love to start the next week with at least a shared\nunderstanding of the things we have discussed, but you have never seen. Then we have some common ground. I am really trying to work with you in\na constructive and positive way to dispel FUD and focus on fact! Hope you see it that way too! Education cannot hurt us now.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 05:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: As We Discussed\nMessage 980 of 4024\nThe message back from your lawyer was I was aware of blink cameras ( I definitely was not) and had access to account..\nWhy you would point direction at my car makes no sense.\nExplanation of accounts suddenly connecting after years of no connection is unbelievable.\nYou initially said you saw an alert and not a video of me returning. Story changed after now you know what Adrian saw.\nYou have not provided credentials to account where you viewed the video.\nSo an apology with lies is not an apology.\nThe video versus att and Xfinity’s are two different issues. The text you sent was very creepy.\nI’m not going to debate this further.\nDr Brown will help sort out but to be clear my position is you illegally monitored us. That’s why RO and the communication protocols\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD\nMessage 981 of 4024\nI just checked and for whatever reason prices dropped. I can get it for 1k per ticket which is a huge difference.\nLmk if I can pull trigger for boys and I.\nSent:02/02/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 06:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spring Break/Cabo",
