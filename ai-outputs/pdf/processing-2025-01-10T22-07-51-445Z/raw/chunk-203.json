When we stop. When we use OFW\nbefore you go dark for 12 hours. No email, text, phone. Please show some consideration and respect for me as well. We can be brief, but you totally\ntook something wrong because this is the only f’ing way you allow us to even communicate. Please don’t put this off till tomorrow, Christine.

I found it looking for the basketball schedule. It’s sad that it was so clear at the start of December that we would end up here.\nBefore any of this cam shit. A full month before that was even an issue you had ended all contact with the kids. This was your “strategy” is what you\ntold Debbie. Even after we all agreed in our counseling that I needed to move on and make “new traditions” for us.\nThis was so predictable. It’s the logical path you choose as soon as you met Yurushka. I said it then, I have said it many times since, and I’ll say it again\ntonight- You will stop at nothing to destroy me, my history and my future. You are eager and willing to sacrifice the kids relationship with their father,\neven in his sobriety and health. You started months ago, it’s noted below, and you will never admit it. Just like with you and Kevin, always a reason to\ndeny the truth>>\nI agree that we need a parenting plan ASAP. Most of the disagreements we have are related to being able to spend time with my family. I also have a\nlot of regrets wrt how this has gone. Obviously, I did not see this coming, and as we have involved various third parties, the acrimony and disdain have\nintensified to an unbearable level.\nOddly enough, I was reading a communication we had in August. We were still having lunch, dinners, doing joint projects, and enjoying amazing xxx.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 11:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:46 AM)\nSubject:From Dec 11th",
