It takes so much time when we could just send a simple formatted email.\nBut that is also noted below... lol.\nLooking forward to fleshing this out but you need to tell me how and where. Thanks for the cooperation this week. Except the \"post-Anna Lisa\"\nmoment last Friday when everything took a 180 turn, , we are over ten days of actually working together!\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel!!! (unless it's actually a train with Anna Lisa on the side... lol )\nJoking aside, I hope we have turned a corner. I'd like to consider this weekend for my suggested detente. Each day we put this off, it just gets worse.\nAnd if we don't try, we will never be able to demonstrate that we can do this... it's our catch-22. So let's just answer it once and for all.\nHope you are having a good day! I appreciate the multitasking!!!\nSent:02/13/2024 at 02:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 06:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: First Draft",
