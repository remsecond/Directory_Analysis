You are responsible for them.\nYou have to know that’s crazy after all the years we have been together with you in the same boat.\nDon’t want to fight or trigger you please!!!\nSent:02/16/2024 at 08:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1481 of 4024\nBTW- Why on Gods green earth would my own attorney say I beat you and my kids and will again. She suggested an RO for you, like you noted.\nAnd when push comes to shove, we would need to be able to prove that, right? Making false allegations to obtain an RO is a really big deal in custody\nfights. That’s easy research.!Both for the person saying it and any officer of the court who facilitate it.\nThat is why I have been asking over and over, week after week, to pull that shit back. We have discussed many times and you agreed. But then you\nwent to Anna Lisa and doubled down. Then proclaimed “Inal in charge Robert” I wondered why on earth you would do that when we could\npeacefully resolve, but you specifically insisted on saying that crap.\nAt the end of the day, if you say it, you have to prove it. There is nothing to fight about. I tried to let us both back off this crazy escalation, you seemed\nto agree all week and then on Friday someone else joins the party. That is why I want to talk! This stuff is bat shit crazy, and someone will find out I\ndon’t beat you all at some point. Because it never happened.\nYour call. You said. You will prove it.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 08:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me\nMessage 1482 of 4024\nWrapped up keys and deposit stuff this week. Please keep an eye out for a check I sent to our house so I don’t misplace it here.  Assume it will be\nthere mid next week for ~$1300?\nSent:02/16/2024 at 08:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Alki\nMessage 1483 of 4024\nI’d rather just not talk than spend another day fighting with you. I can’t seem to do anything right I’m so tired of even trying. Hope you have a good\nday. And fwiw, if pigs fly, my offer to grab decafe and consignment shop still stands. I don’t know any other way to try and break the cycle but\nSent:02/17/2024 at 01:07 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/17/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Today",
