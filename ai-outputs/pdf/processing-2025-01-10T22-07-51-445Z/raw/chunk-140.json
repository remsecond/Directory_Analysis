It’s not a zoom call but she said to call her.\nI think you call me then we add her to the group call.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 07:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 07:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Meeting With SAAS\nMessage 1240 of 4024\nWhy would the wrong RO be filed? Why would you send over something for me to sign that tonight you are saying in the only edits you will make?\nWe talked all week about the other things we need. You asked me to share, so we could have running list, or important one on one detailed emails.\nIf you were going to file the right, RO, please, let’s consider the list that I sent. If you disagree with any of them or don’t think that they will make\nproblem-solving easier, please let me know.\nThis is all with the best intentions in mind Christine so we can work better together. I promise you, I’m not gonna fuck this up. Just like I said all\nweek, I’m all in.\nI guess I just don’t understand why you’re going back on everything you said ????\nSent:02/08/2024 at 07:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 09:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: RO Communications/Kids\nMessage 1241 of 4024\nCan you please come over so we can coordinate our answers better and not talk all over each other?\nSent:02/08/2024 at 07:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 09:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Meeting With SAAS\nMessage 1242 of 4024\nAll week, every day, you asked me to help out and offer suggestions, give you guidance on what will make things better for us, whether it was the\nSAAS application, the RO, the court order, or the Dr. Brown engagement.\nYou also gave me your expectations for a return to normalcy. I thanked you, complied and I’ve really enjoyed working as a team. you also asked me to\nshow patience, assuring me that you would get back shortly to resolve.\nFor some reason that all blew up tonight. It feels like Annalisa is the puppet master. She did not even file the right RO that was discussed with Lisa. It’\ns super frustrating.to have her as the go between.
