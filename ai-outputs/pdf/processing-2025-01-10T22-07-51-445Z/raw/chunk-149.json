  "text": "Message 1272 of 4024\nPlease stop sending all the family memories. I keep asking, you say sorry. And then another box lands. Please stop... I’m hoping at some point our\nwhole life is not devoid of any memories together. It will be a shame to teach the kids that.\nAnd thank you for the original blink cameras . As mentioned, we bought the black Blink cameras for the outdoors, the white Blink cameras for the\nindoors, and then I gave you the ring camera as a Christmas present. You have now found all the cameras we bought years ago now. This is what I\nsaid.\nI admitted I swapped them before this mess. You clearly put the old ones away, so knew we had them. The new ones were in plain view, never hidden.\nAnd in the same place. May we please step back and consider you might have known about them? You put them away with your own hands.\nPlease see attached. There is one, that went above the door. It still has the same mount on it that was used to put it in the same holes that the Comcast\ncams used. The other has no mount. It was never mounted. It sat pointing at the door as a deterrent. You sent what I said we had for years.\nI am not looking to start an argument, or re-litigate. I am simply pointing out that this is my exact explanation. And if you did not know about them,\nthat’s fine. But note you put them in bags and put them away. And now you sent them back to me.\nIf this doesn’t make sense, I’m happy to explain. But you get the point. We bought them years ago. You packed them away. And here they are. I have\nnot been lying. They are on my coffee table now. Please consider my explanation again given this.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 08:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 08:43 PM)\nSubject:All Our Family Memories\nAttachments:IMG_1313.jpg (2 MB)\nMessage 1273 of 4024\nIt is not a coincidence that my timeline works out perfectly with the manufacturer date. See attached.\nI bought these three years ago. These are the cams.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 08:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 08:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: All Our Family Memories\nAttachments:IMG_1316.PNG (341 KB)\nIMG_1317.jpg (968 KB)\nMessage 1274 of 4024\nShare the receipt for the most recent ones and user name and password for account that was set up.,\nI did not know and you know that.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 08:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 08:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: All Our Family Memories",
