I feel like this week is even crazier than the fire drills I remember. Are you still Ok for SAAS?\n- Yes. I can. I trust you are ok with our last email?\n- Should I share what I did to Lori? I think, yes.\nPlease, please let me help my best friend for 29 years out. My unpacking and errands can wait for you.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 03:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 03:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon\nMessage 1220 of 4024\nI’ll update SAAS application with your writing. You can tell Lori we will request transcript and teacher recommendation. I’ll need to look into that.\nSent:02/08/2024 at 03:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/08/2024 at 04:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Time Sensitive Items: Thursday Afternoon",
