Most kids have a dance and Joe is OOF as well. It would be good a good opportunity to let AD\npractice AAU this week for a change. That said the quality of play on this particular team (with some exceptions) is pretty freaking good.\nI am a little worried about his health. We both agree he was under the weather. I appreciate he wanted to do it. but it's also sketch to try and play at\n50%. If he is sick on Sat I might have to tell him he can't play. But he should support the team if possible. Just keep me updated.\nI'll be coaching solo again this week on Sat. It was good of Surya to let me know that his dad was complaining about his playing time and they wanted\nhim in the game more this week... lol Seems like a nice guy but it's a dick move. Take over boss.. show is all yours.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 05:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 06:53 AM)\nSubject:Hoops Friday",
