We can do it this way and still live, but it's not going to be\ngood for us or the kids, and probably bankrupt us in the end.\nThen there is also the reality of situations that arrive on the fly like Elsa this AM. At this point, the fact that she blames me for her entire childhood\nand you were just a bystander may be a deal breaker for her and I. Historically we spoke with one voice. Hell, I think July 5th came to a head because I\nwas defending you. But it's a big deal that may mean we don't talk again for years. We are quite literally crashing and burning.\nI almost feel like we need a general contractor to host a summit for us. But at a minimum, we need to figure out what we are trying to do here and\nhow to communicate more sustainably. This is more harm than good.\nHere is what I have for today. I hope we just try to touch on issues with a quick Ack and next steps. Then wait for Anna Lisa to tell us when we can\nchat about the mental health, safety, and well-being of our kids.\nRunning List- You're speaking w/ Anna Lisa, thank you! What's the plan, She's not responsive tbh.\nAdrian- Our most important item yesterday. You won't consider my plan. Can we have a fallback?SAAS- Still stuck in neutral here. We need to have a\nbigger discussion on financial commitment.\nLugg- Are we aligned on day/time/payload? Who is going to set it up? Did I tip them? Use Devon?Dr Brown- Can we fix email? What's scope and\noutcome desired? Is she expected to adjudicate?\nXfinity, ATT, Bofa- I get alerts still, you are the 2x auth on ATT, you get all my stuff for BoFa now\nSoberLink- I finally located and put an airtag on it. I also peed and sent that in. Are we good?\nTruce- We agreed to try but it feels like you are not in a place to really try this now. Thoughts?\nRO- what was the intent and desired outcome? I signed it but nothing appears to have changed.\n--------------------------Cut line?-------------------------------\nElsa- Big bucket. no apology to you? our swinging? no shared responsibility, all me that did this?\nCommunication- We agreed to see someone, we did not. Now we can't talk. Can we address?\nOne Voice- You said kids don't know. Appears you have talked in great detail to them. What's up?Transfers- We are covered right now (agree) but we\nneed the running list discussion to sync.\nEmails- you do them occasionally. Should I do that too? Are we allowed to CC each other\nBills- what bills are you no longer paying? What should I be picking up that I am unaware of ?\nBoys Blink- I shared an apology. You take issue with the explanation. But can you share \"sorry\"\nSent:02/01/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
