So I hope\nyou can help. To close on the phone and text messaging comments, I want to clarify the history of call/text reporting, the nature of these reports, and\nour mutual access to them as account holders. And when I was thinking about it, I realized they have likely never even seen a paper phone bill.\nI hope you will tell them that the activity described, which includes calls and texts, has long been a standard practice by phone companies that began\nin the 1980s for long-distance calls. Which were expensive. The purpose was to ensure billing accuracy and transparency to customers so they could\nmanage phone usage. This used to terrify me when I would sneak down River Oaks Parkway every night to secretly call you in Hong Kong.\nSo as account holders, we both have always had access to this information. It is our family plan after all. I even think we used to get a paper bill\nourselves. But it's not a form of surveillance by me or you. It's a standard feature by ATT for accountability, fraud detection, and accurate record-\nkeeping. And your status as an account holder inherently includes consent to reporting your data back to you as a part of the service agreement, we\nhave.\nI get without context and having never seen the fat white and blue envelopes with tens of lines of numbers inside, they don't have history. They don't\nrealize that roommates or families would grab a highlighter and take turns finding their boy or girlfriend's phone number and say which calls were\ntheirs. Then pull out the calculator to total everyone's share of the bill, just like we did with restaurant tabs when we would split up a big dinner bill.\nThey should know that our intention was never to monitor or surveil their phone usage. The logs on our bill for phone and text records is just a\nroutine aspect of our phone service. It has gone on for decades now for good reason. It started with paper fifty years ago and has since largely moved\nto an online bill where it's possible to filter, sort, pivot, and categorize history just like you can do with any online date. But it's not spying now or\nthen.\nI hope since you have their ear, and I can't teach them like I used to do, you will explain so they understand. It's just good parenting, and I trust you\nwill convey the message and ease their unfounded fears. I think we all grew up knowing that every number we dialed would show on the bill so we\nsure as hell better not spend all night on the phone with our future wife in Asia. It's just funny how we lost that history and the tribal knowledge\nsince.\nThanks!\nMessage 850 of 4024\nIs due Feb 7 in amount of 7,612 to cover Max’s ongoing school enrollment,\nWith a balance of 6.7k in BofA currently which is  insufficient funds to cover tuition in BofA plus ongoing expenses.\nThe 40k transferred was to cover my Amex card for 13k plus Chase/Amazon account for 28k.\nWhen I looked you had paid off your Amex for 9.5k (I had no visibility balance) and your lawyer bill of 3.6k  which was not factored into the 40k.

Just keep me updated.\nI'll be coaching solo again this week on Sat.

But even saying that given recent history is kicking a bees nest so let's table that. I assume we won't have that luxury. I\ncan dream.\nSo we need to make some assumptions we are not sure will come to pass and come up with a roadmap that assures he can go to SAAS and what it\ntakes to make that happen. The elephant in the room is when I can find work. That helps a lot with our planning. Even if we have no idea what our\nsplit looks like, we know more money and a dependable revenue stream always helps, no matter what. That is not a debate.\nSo, there is another bee's nest. As I am wandering around this place, up since five as usual, trying to sort my life from bags and boxes, as you and I\nnormally are manning our battle stations for the day (again maybe all my fault) I have to be realistic about trying to start an entirely new life (you were\nable to continue your sans me), attend therapy, and be ready for the next crazy, while trying to land a job at Amazon or Google. We know the toll that\ntook on me when you were fully in my corner. So that weighs on my mind as I apply for jobs. And tbh, in my mind there is just no way I can work if\nthings are like they are now (my fault or not) or even land a job.\nSo... without a fight, we need to decide if we have enough confidence in our direction and desired decision to make a Go/No Go call on the bullets\nabove. The reality is we can, we are just at a high risk of getting ourselves into a situation that we cannot sustain. My feeling is we need to have a really\nhonest discussion about what we see as our next steps. SAAS is a little microcosm of our macro picture that could be a forcing function for us. I went\nWAY OFF into the weeds but wanted you to understand my perspective. I want to work. I want to be settled. I want stability. I want to be what I was\nto our family for 25 years without the bad parts.\nBut I am not confident I can do all that in the status quo. But I can assure you my goal is to continue to provide support for my family, monetarily\nand emotionally for - you and the kids. That was my lifelong commitment, no matter what.  But it's not going to be solved in OFW. And I am not\npushing you to go off OFW. I am asking for realistic ideas for how we have a peaceful and planful discussion on SAAS right now along with an\nacknowledgment of the macro factors that I am trying to consider every day. If this in any way has kicked off a fight, please let me withdraw the\nthoughts above and just get back to a SAAS decision this week.\nWhat would you like to do?\nMessage 870 of 4024\nAppreciate the perspective. It’s a lot to digest but feel and appreciate it is hitting all the issues that need to be navigated.\nI’ll need to connect with my lawyer on how best to navigate how we can address these pressing issues.\nSent:01/31/2024 at 08:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/31/2024 at 08:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hoops Friday\nMessage 871 of 4024\nTo overstate the obvious on the elephant noted below...

He needs to see we are listening to him, and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most\nimportantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life.

We put our differences aside and find one voice between us, as it should be when he needs us most.\nProposing you and I do the following:\nWe try and meet AD where he is, and you even serve as gentle training wheels for us\n- I call him tomorrow and say we should all get together to discuss the SAAS option\n- I ask if I could come grab him after school Friday to help clean up for a big family meeting\n- I pick him up wearing the Homer Simpson shirt he got and a new Nike Tech replacement.\n- We go to my place and I show him the progress on all his ideas at the place he picked out\n- We decide on a to-do list of home improvements to make it shine before the SAAS summit.\nNow it's his day! He is number one and sees it in action. He has a gentle re-entry with Dad as we work on a todo list and we can talk about where he is\nat. We get things in order and prepare for Mom!!! Now this is something he never thought that could happen last Monday.\n- When you arrive, AD gives you a tour of the place that he picked out and shows off.\n- Mom let's him know how pleased and proud of him she is and that he has great ideas.\n- We make some popcorn and serve some drinks and he can play host a bit for Mom\n- Then we talk about SAAS. largely info we know already, but he has a voice to hear\n- We make some foregone conclusions, but he feels like he is driving the decisions\n- We can even play a game of ping pong to feel normal again for once since July\nAfterward, Dad can serve juicy steaks or Mom and AD head back to Kirkland. Ad knows he is first in our lives and has confidence after seeing us\ntogether that there is no more \"lost in our mess\" he feels today.\nIf we can please do this, and put our issues aside, I assure you this could be a game changer on so many levels and possibly accelerate some of the\nhealing even before we get in front of the shrinks!\nIt is so important right now that he sees Mom and Dad do what was impossible before.

I called to be sure that she knew phone numbers showed up on our bill but it exploded into how I\nruined her life. I may not agree with some of her characterizations, but that does not matter. It is her perspective. Her perception that it was me alone\ntrying to figure out what was going on in High School was surprising but understandable.\nShe told me she saw the cameras in September and thought you had put them up. I wish we had the discussion then. But it was a small point to what\nshe opened my eyes to. And it is consistent with the talk track you have played to me. That in my alcoholic years, you felt a need to acquiesce to me.\nYou were just trying to keep the peace and not rock the boat. I needed to hear that.\nI understood then as she snuck boys into her room, sent underage porn on her phone, vomited vodka over both sides of the truck (she had been\ndriving), lost a six-figure full ride to college shoplifting for a boy, and made LBGTQ offensive online posts, what we were doing to get her back on the\nrails was mutually agree to. we both were trying to sus things out together.\nBut her perspective is that it was all me and has always been all me. And now this incident is just a continuation of that behavior. It is important to me\nthat I know now that I am seen as the villain in this family. That we were not the team I thought we were. And at least in her mind (and maybe yours)\nI was doing all these things to be nefarious and ruin her life. I need to think on that.\nBut most important is the insight into where I think you are coming from. I thought as we were raising our kids we were aligned. But you are washing\nyour hands clean of that. That this was all me and you had nothing to do with it. It is a history that does not match mine. But I was an active alcoholic\nso maybe I was missing things that you were telling me or misinterpreting things.\nEither way, it was a deep and insightful lens into the narrative you and the kids have. And at this point in my life, it helps explain a lot. I believe\nmarriage takes two, but if the perspective is it was all me as some despotic ruler, I want to acknowledge that and do some soul-searching on how this\ncame to pass. How I thought we were making parenting decisions together but were not.\nIt has been said that \"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”\nMaybe I'm that asshole...\nSent:02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM)\nSubject:Elsa",

It’s a big number and between Max and I we could be talking about ~1k-2k a month so while it might seem like a\nfrivolous ask, I think it’s important to agree on.\nThanks!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 12:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 01:11 PM)\nSubject:ADHD- Max’s Vyvanse",

And then I will offer something to do together like this \"Hey, I know\nyou probably already have plans, but if they fall through, I'd love to XYZ with you, so just let me know\" He always does but at least he knows the\noffer is there and I'm thinking of him.\nI'd like to do the same for AD this afternoon to shoot some hoops here. It is gorgeous and would be fun. Just so you are aware, he and I have been\nhaving some deep, AD lead conversations- Cabo, Whistler, Hawaii, and Vegas. We have touched them all. He wants me to understand the impact it\nhas had on him, and know why I did that.\nEvery time we go there, just like when he has asked me to blow, I am very positive and reassuring. I thank him sincerely for not turning his back on me\nand loving me enough to have a difficult conversation that makes him feel uncomfortable. It is a true sign of unconditional love. I appreciate it and\nwant him to know I'm an open book.\nSo, with those things noted:\n- Gorgeous day to shoot some hoops\n- A safe way to bow out of an offer to play\n- We are having important conversations\nI'd like to see if he wants to shoot hoops for an hour. I take him to practice. You pick him up!\nI don't see a down said but appreciate your concerns in advance. I hope you can find a way to let \"us work on us\" in a safe space (nothing safer and\nmore comfortable than a game of pig for me and him) in a small-time boxed opportunity until you and I have a longer discussion/explanation.\nthanks!\nSent:02/02/2024 at 02:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/02/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD",

You are asking me to revert back to behavior in\nthe marriage where I pretend things did not happen, brush it off, act happy, and not hold you accountable. That has stoped. I recognize my feelings\nand impact and do not just move on. As I process each scary or volatile interaction in a manner that it deserves, and they continue or escalate, it\ncompounds and gets worse as there is no recognition that you don’t start back at zero each time. It is still in a deficit that keeps getting worse. This\nbehavior and reaction from me and family is what you do not recognize, which is holding you firmly accountable each time.

It took time, you put thought into it, and it all makes perfect sense to me. I will not justify my reaction to our situation\nbut I always have held firm that V Little on June 30th would be proud that I was fighting Christine of July 5th. That I would do anything to save our\nmarriage and keep our family together, fending off anyone who would destroy it. And that’s what I see happening.\nThat misses the point entirely. I do think she would appreciate me fighting to learn, heal, and have a better, stronger rebirth that puts us on course for\nforever. But what I am missing is the way I’m doing it is the entire reason we are here. The thought is noble, the execution is destructive. It’s like a\nChinese finger trap, the harder I fight and struggle, the worse it gets for us both. She would not like that at all.\nIf I continue the swings, the volatility, the madness, after you made yourself clear tonight in a very thoughtful way, I deserve to never walk down that\npath with you. Alternatively, if I show you I listened, like I had listened this spring, and work on myself for the sake of us, I hope it has a better ending.\nI realize I have reverted, I thought about it tonight. But I can get back on the right path again. I will show you.\nSo thank you for the honest feedback. And while it would have been great to hear in June, I do hear it now and I am acknowledging it.

Thank you for getting Anna Lisa to send. Two questions on the terms that I hope that you and I can discuss more cost-\neffectively than the lawyers.\nWRT - [x] Credible Threat: The Restrained Person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the Protected Person.\nYesterday you told the court I had committed domestic violence. Today you are asking me to sign something that says I am a physical threat to you\nand the kids. My hands have been there to tie shoes, wipe tears, hold ice packs, make love, walk hand in hand, morning hugs, and make love. That is all\nthey are for with you and the boys.\nThat is what you have seen and I hope you know is true this morning. Do we need to say you believe that I will beat you and my children? I can't\nimagine in the deepest depths of my despair over our dissolution I would seek you out and physically harm you or our boys. Must you say that you\nbelieve this to be untrue and you think I will beat you all?\nWRT - The parties may also communicate via email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or\nmanaging the parties’ shared assets.\nThanks again for this. Very helpful. But as I have noted on many occasions that OFW is a terrible platform for much of our communications. It is\nbetter as a single subject, single reply, 124 characters, non-copy paste, short burst text tool. Most of the time we communicate on emails we have\nseveral things we are trying to resolve in somewhat complex multi-point situations.\nAnd more often than not, we actually do not want to conduct our \"sausage-making\" in front of the diner who will eat it. But your offer proposes that\nthey always have to be present on the thread, we can't drop them, resolve, and add them back. Can you please reconsider?\nThanks again for your efforts to partner constructively in a positive way. Given this is a timely conversation and Lisa is waiting on my direction, it\nwould be great if we could resolve ASAP.\nbest\nrobert\nSent:02/06/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",

As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward\ncommunications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.\n- Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children\nand/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted for in-depth,\nmulti-topic communications and or \"FYI notifications\", without the mandatory inclusion of a third party. This is under the condition that both\nparties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone. If a communication is deemed potentially contentious, a mutually agreed upon third\nparty may be included at the discretion of either party for oversight, with prior written agreement.\n- Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed\nurgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior written agreement in the Our Family Wizard platform or a related email.\nThis is under the condition that both parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone.\n- Additional Conditions: Should either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to\nreview and potential revision to ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.\nI think this sets us up for longer-term success (important, so we are not doing this every two weeks as we grow as co-parents) but also still allows for\nthe opportunity to re-visit if one of us starts behaving badly... It is optimistic but the best of both worlds with a built-in \"out\".\nThanks in advance for your thoughtful consideration. (Doing this email in OFW sucked btw )\nrobert\nMessage 1148 of 4024\nBTW- There is no RO. There never has been. I know you kept saying that, but Anna Lisa never filed it. I've reviewed all the case history.\nI sent my thoughts separately as I anticipated this and wanted to be as helpful as I could given today is mandatory \"in the office\" day and likely back to\nback..\nAck- on availability. Too bad I can't swing by with fresh poke, avocado and lemons... I really enjoyed taking care of you, seeing you smile.

But I will be honest and forthcoming and hope you see this as a constructive response and not a\npersonal attack.\nAn RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified. I am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any\nviolation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I would hope you received same guidance.\n<<You have been saying that the RO was filed for a couple of weeks. But we did what we needed to do to advance our issues. Now you won't and\nhave a sudden change of heart. You were going to work with Anna Lisa to modify the RO so we could be more effective, especially acknowledging the\nneed for our \"Running List\" format. None of that happened. We are not much better off today than two weeks ago. And even after trying to resolve it\nat your request yesterday with haste, the \"no upgrade\" RO was filed.\nToday- zero progress, nothing in sight. I realize this is not business, but know you are far more capable than this. If you were 90% blocked from\neffectively doing your job, had been saying you would fix it for two weeks, came back and told Julie you didn't fix anything, you are still blocked but\nwill keep at it with no timeline or schedule even with all the help you can get, I don't see that flying tbh. I will be patient as I promised, but you\nbrought it up so just replying. >>\nFor Dr Brown, we will need to align here. She asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me. My goal is to update of\nsituation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will consider. We all have a different\nperspective on what occurred. Impact to Adrian and me was/is real. I am not going to brush aside Adrian’s concerns that he expressed to me. I’d like\nto confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we lose the spot and it gets pushed out further.\n<<We do need to align. The only context she has to define her plan of action is your email. That's it. She has no idea who and why to involve in the\ndiscussion and why? I would like to align, as I have mentioned from day one. Not just today, but every single day since this started. Only responding\nto the 10th request a day or two before we do this is not grounds for saying \"well it's too late, let's go with it.\" Further, this was about AD and I. That\nis it. We both saw it and were never given a chance to discuss or explain.\nSo now we need to discuss reunification as a result and if we handle the situation in a way, healthiest for him. And what we should do in the future. It\nis appropriate for those impacted by what AD saw- AD, Me, you, to have that conversation. No one else. This is not about relitigating something I\napologized for, and as you say, we both disagree on. Dr Brown should not be making that judgment. She is not qualified>>\nA shared proposal I hope we can both get behind and work as a team:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nwe handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns. .\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting\nplan if necessary.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 03:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...",

I’m hoping at some point our\nwhole life is not devoid of any memories together. It will be a shame to teach the kids that.\nAnd thank you for the original blink cameras . As mentioned, we bought the black Blink cameras for the outdoors, the white Blink cameras for the\nindoors, and then I gave you the ring camera as a Christmas present. You have now found all the cameras we bought years ago now. This is what I\nsaid.\nI admitted I swapped them before this mess. You clearly put the old ones away, so knew we had them. The new ones were in plain view, never hidden.\nAnd in the same place. May we please step back and consider you might have known about them? You put them away with your own hands.\nPlease see attached. There is one, that went above the door. It still has the same mount on it that was used to put it in the same holes that the Comcast\ncams used. The other has no mount. It was never mounted. It sat pointing at the door as a deterrent. You sent what I said we had for years.\nI am not looking to start an argument, or re-litigate. I am simply pointing out that this is my exact explanation. And if you did not know about them,\nthat’s fine. But note you put them in bags and put them away. And now you sent them back to me.\nIf this doesn’t make sense, I’m happy to explain. But you get the point. We bought them years ago. You packed them away. And here they are. I have\nnot been lying. They are on my coffee table now. Please consider my explanation again given this.\nSent:02/09/2024 at 08:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/09/2024 at 08:43 PM)\nSubject:All Our Family Memories\nAttachments:IMG_1313.jpg (2 MB)\nMessage 1273 of 4024\nIt is not a coincidence that my timeline works out perfectly with the manufacturer date.

Robert and I have a different perspective on what unfolded and can share in our discussions. Our lawyers are also aligned with this\nproposed approach on how we might address this issue in relation to the parenting plan. Our proposal would be to schedule a conversation with our\nyoungest son Adrian to share his experience and impact to him, potentially our oldest daughter Elsa, myself and Robert.\nOur Ask:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nway we handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns.\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our\nparenting plan if necessary.\n- How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being\nformally approved. So TBD.\nDr Brown did not seem to do this at all. In any way. Either one of our asks above.

I could have been more helpful but did not want to ruin a positive conversation with you.\nNow that you have taken the reigns of the Network, however, you see all the stuff I used to see.  It is not intentional, you don't always understand it,\nbut unwelcome alerts pop up on your phone. I know, it happened to me all the freaking time.\nThe good news is that Samsung is likely a TV that was out of Wi-Fi range and conditions changed (a door that is usually closed is left open) or it has\nnot been turned on in a long while (maybe the TV in the man cave?). Then it reconnects, then you get an alert.\nThe good news is to join the network, it had to have a password at some point. And maybe this was just a TV that has not been joined since you\nchanged the WiFI name? That can happen. So it's annoying for sure, but probably safe, and not nefarious.\nSo as mentioned, if you let me know next time, I can teach you how to open an alert, investigate what it is, and have some peace of mind that it should\nbe there. Some android devices are no help, but Samsung usually has the metadata you need.\nAlternatively, perhaps I can screen record simulating the same situation on my phone and share it with you. A picture is worth a thousand words, so a\nvideo is probably worth a book. Divorce is the worst time to have this kind of alert crap happening.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 10:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1358 of 4024\nWe are waiting on Anna Lisa.

Each day we put this off, it just gets worse.\nAnd if we don't try, we will never be able to demonstrate that we can do this... it's our catch-22. So let's just answer it once and for all.\nHope you are having a good day!

It is not working. I appreciate the civility we have shared over the last ten days, but the reality is we are not\none task closer to solving anything. And you don't reach out with the smallest olive branch to communicate with me, even with the last\nobstacle cleared by Anna Lisa. I don't anticipate any change. It is an established pattern, and I was misguided to think you might find the time or\nenergy but I am still glad I tried.\nBecause it's not about the RO. Has little to do with emails, texts, or calls. Or the fact that Xfinity spams me with alerts even after you took\nresponsibility a month ago. It's not about you attesting that I have and will beat you to the police. Or that you have five registered audio/video devices\nthat can drop in on my most private moments going back to my beach days. Or even Dr Brown's crazy misguided off-target effort that includes no\nreunification agenda. It is about the barriers.\nSee, those are just bumps in the road. Hindrances to the singular thing that matters. And that is if you believe our boys are better off without me. You\nhave wiped me, and our memories from the house. I assume you would format their brains if you could. And if by whatever means possible, believe\nthey should have me separated from their existence all altogether. This, all after the best spring and summer we could ever have had together.\nYou are omnipotent in this system and your actions demonstrate that eliminating a strong, sober, father figure is your desire. It is not a priority for our\nboys to have a biological father as a role model or a positive force in their lives, teaching them lessons learned and passing on wisdom from my failures.\nAfter banishing all positive memories perhaps, you will replace me soon. And with each passing day, it becomes their new narrative, engrained more\ndeeply,\nI acknowledge the challenges I have introduced into our lives, and I understand the expectation was for me to have navigated my childhood based on\nan innate moral compass and not pass anything I learned along. But now the question comes down to redemption and healing. And is that something\nwe should foster in these young men? Will it serve them better to face the past, do the work, and heal or should they continue down the path of\nalienation and punishment?\nYour stance suggests a preference for moving on without addressing the potential for reconciliation and growth. But this overlooks the essence of my\nattempts to communicate and reintegrate into our sons' lives, aiming to contribute positively to their development into resilient and capable\nindividuals. You may see it just as \"robert wants to text or call... no way\" but it misses the point. I'm trying to knock down obstacles that keep us from\naddressing the issues.\nSo as another day passes, you sign on for five minutes, spraying a couple of responses before going dark for the next five hours, only to rinse and repeat\ntwice more before you shut down, I urge you to reflect on the deeper reasons behind my persistence. I am striving to dismantle the barriers preventing\nour sons' healing. Please consider if it might be worth taking a moment from Starbucks or your social life, and sitting down to discuss our path\nSent:02/14/2024 at 12:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 06:53 AM)\nSubject:Happy Valentine's Day!",

I don't care to fight.\nFor that matter. Given your reaction this morning, I want to respect your position and don't care to communicate much anymore. You said we both\nwanted peace and explained what it would take to get to normalcy. I tried for almost two weeks, and you were mostly pleasant in OFW for which I\nappreciate. But we got nothing done, no olive branch, and today we only got worse. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy kicking the football. You can\nGoogle it...\nBut you asked about the cams that you sent over with the exact same mounts (one single, one none) you said you never knew existed and if they did,\nyou never knew about them. I won't disagree with you. I just saw you had packed them away and eventually sent them to me. I won't confirm or deny\nyou knew of them. You just handled them. I gave you the ring for xmas. I did not install it. The others were set up but were not reliable or all that\nuseful. We took the white indoor cams down, you put the away, but left the outdoor cams up as a deterrent.\n- Sending a pic of the Amazon purchase before Xmas in 2020. Install date is unknown tbh.\n- Sharing a pic of the outdoor cams, please note how the mounts match the newer ones.\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I am not saying you knew but you asked two questions I'd like to offer my thoughts on.\nOne: \"If we had them, why didn't I have the Blink App installed?\"\nI don't know. If you say you never installed it I believe you. I had it, they did a shitty job so perhaps we stopped using them before you even needed to.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 02:42 PM)\nSubject:Your Questions This AM\nAttachments:Amazon_Screen_Purchases.jpg (261 KB)\nimage_50434817.JPG (1 MB)",

But I had shared them with you (indoor and outdoor) and knew those worked, but never installed the app\nfor those.\nThat said, you also never installed:\n- Nest App- It works well, you are aware of it, and never installed it, but ask me to use it for you.\n- Sleep Number App- It is also helpful but you never installed it. But maybe just did not need to.\n- Frame Apps- We had them in the living room and used them daily. You choose not to install.\n- Samsung App- It sets the picture you see in the cat room and bedroom. You did not install.\n- Alexa- You still have several cam/audio devices that can drop in on me. Not sure what's up.\nWhen we were a loving couple doing our own thing, lots of times I would be geeked out on something, you would smile and nod, feign interest but\nnot really act. That was normal.\nTwo: \"If we had them, I would have remembered them?\"\nI don't have any reason to believe you would not, so this may be true too. And I won't fight if you really believe that you have no memory of that. I\nwill say that we do forget things sometimes, however. Everyone does.\nThis could be a long list, but you will get the point:\nCarbon Monoxide Detector- I made a pretty big deal of this, explaining that I always am sure to take them on vacation with us. I talked about why I\ndo that and all the crazy AirBnB stories that made me scared. I wanted to protect our family and noted that I would be taking it to protect your\nbrother along with Justin and Josh. For some reason, it was being used as a WiFi repeater in your clear line of the site where you spend hours every\nweek. Maybe you forgot?\nPrivate Moments- I asked you recently if you remember our Hyatt stay. You didn't. This surprised me. It was one of the few times we made time for\nan overnight together. In the end, we bickered on the way home, but that night, and especially the morning, was an all-time great freaking sweaty, sexy\ntime. WOW!! And.. we took crazy explicit pics of you. By far the hardest core thing we ever did. Face and all. I won't attach pics. I would think you\nwould remember, but don't.\nMy point is everyone forgets things but believes they are absolutely in command of the facts. I have even watched Netflix documentaries on it. It is\ncalled the \"eyewitness memory distortion \" effect. It's a fascinating human phenomenon and it's super interesting to see it broken down and explained.\nThat said, who knows, maybe I did not even mention it to you. I may be guilty of the same thing and thought I told you but didn't. But like the\n\"Alexa drop in\" we used often at times; it was just normal when we were a happy family. We did not think of it as spying.\nThis is of course equally true of:\n- Our shared ATT family plan\n- Parental control for the kids\n- Screen time alerts for the kids\n- New device joining Xfinity alerts\nI don't really care about what the Luddites in the family law world or the perversion of good intentions into bad, that this has become. When we were\na happy family, this was all approved, discussed, and, welcomed. Protecting your kids in the real world is expected. And phone bills have had call/text\nhistory since long before cell phones even existed.\nYou didn't ask about things rejoining the network today or about alerts that pop like Blink did. But you have seen them with Samsung Alerts. So, at a\nminimum, you have to realize this is a true and demonstratable network phenomenon. I can also prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the cams DO\nNOT work in the places you saw them, in the open, pointing at exterior doors.\nAt this point, I have digressed. But you asked two questions about the cams, and I wanted to give you, my thoughts. If in reading this, you think that\nit is simply impossible that what I am saying could ever be true, that's you right. I am only offering my true and honest perspective on the event that\nhas traumatized you, because I never had any desire to surveil you.... ever.\nAs mentioned, many times before I am happy to prove this to you in front of your eyes. I have also told you that I bought the new ones at the",

Making false allegations to obtain an RO is a really big deal in custody\nfights.

We will both need to demonstrate that we have\ncompleted, if that’s what we put into the parenting plan.\nDr Brown I believe is following our ask. If you noted her alarmed at what transpired, my personal\nOpinion is that’s it’s justified. You have a different lens on your actions and what they are labeled as, and impact. I don’t think you and I have come\nacross anyone that minimizes your actions from your lens, rather they raise alarm bells. My eyes are wide open now to what was happening and how\nthey are characterized despite your efforts to downplay.\nYes unless it’s an emergency, I intend to use this forum for running list.\nSent:02/21/2024 at 05:19 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 05:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps",

      "text": "Message 1516 of 4024\nPlease take a moment and read your response. It really makes very little sense. I don’t know if it is just awful grammar or you are calling me a lawyer?\nThe first paragraph is indecipherable. Please clarify.\nAnd I did not note her alarm. I know you two secretly met as you confirmed and she denied, but I was not involved in that. So I have no way of\njudging her reaction to one side of an easy solved riddle.\nI have zero idea what the “eyes wide open” comment means. Is this for our 25 year marriage? Or Is it for the cams that did not exist but were sent to\nme? Or the impossible reconnect that you see the TVs do too?\nYou still did not answer the single most and original question I sent.two days and roughly eight hours ago. I have approval to see Adrian from Dr\nBrown. That was your requirement. So how do I see him now?\nYou also completely skipped the question about doing as Dr Brown had asked us to do and you committed to last week. So we begin to work more\npeacefully and constructively together again.\nAnd as you consider how I downplayed things in my past, do you think you might have downplayed your affair with Kevin? It was worth flat out\nlying about to your husband’s face. Did you downplay that at all?\nAs you reply, may I ask you to save the extra words as I do for you. Also please answer the questions. If this is the only format you will permit, it will\ndo us good if you can show even the most primitive attempt here.\nGiven the “emergency” exception noted, how do I get in touch in that case? You plan to stick to this I see, and say I beat you and my kids (the truth\nwill come out) but I don’t know how to reach you, right?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 05:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 05:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1517 of 4024\nYou meet with Dr. Brown on Friday. She will come back with some proposals for the parenting plan.\nSaturday seems like a good day for you to spend time with Adrian. I could suggest before pictures. I have an event I would like to take him to at 3pm\non Saturday (it was going to be a surprise) but I am open to your suggestions.\nSent:02/21/2024 at 06:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 06:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1518 of 4024\n4th time the charm? are we going to try to get the help we have been prescribed but refuse to follow as our ability to co parent goes deeper into the\nshitter every day? You said you were looking into it since we both wanted peace. Again, are you doing that?\nLet’s discuss Saturday later but thank you for the initial proposal. What’s the surprise if I may ask?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 07:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps",
