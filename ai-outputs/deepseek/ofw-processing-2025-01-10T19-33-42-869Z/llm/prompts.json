During their conversation, they decided I would attend the next\nappointment to address some things on Adrian's mind. This is a significant breakthrough, as it's the first time he has agreed to have me join his session\nin all the months he has been going.\nI am excited about this opportunity, especially considering our near-total estrangement and the upcoming trip to Hong Kong, where all of these\nissues began after Elsa and your Mother's advice. The timing is perfect for a breakthrough, especially given the professional advice that there might be\nbetter ideas than the Hong Kong trip.\nI wanted to let you know that I was looking forward to a professionally facilitated discussion. However, you intervened and stopped it. You listed\nmany reasons against it and stated that Adrian voted against attendance because that would mean two full hours in a single week and you two felt like\nthat was too much to invest.\nMy Concerns:\n• I think you should have talked with me instead of letting Adrian vote on therapy without discussing it.\n• As the targeting parent, your influence in this discussion with him may affect his decision to talk to me.\n• You are making 100% of the mental health decisions for our family without any legal authority to do so.\n• This is not what the books Jennifer recommended say to do.

I asked about the sitter to be sure he had her number.\nHe got weird and immediately asked to get off the phone without answering. He said he would call back and never did.\nI’d prefer to have a reasonable dialogue rather than test the expectations of the legal system at great monetary expense and further strain an already\ntoxic and counterproductive relationship.

This is another way you have decided to\ncontrol me.\nI have asked to split finances immediately.\nThe delay is another example of your attempts to control.\nThe travel authorization. People are waiting for you to return that to either finalize plans or decide if they need to change plans.\nWe have Cabo as a proxy of what you will do. You refused to return it despite saying you are not saying “no”.\nI have a full work day. I have demonstrated how you will repeatedly interrupt it.
