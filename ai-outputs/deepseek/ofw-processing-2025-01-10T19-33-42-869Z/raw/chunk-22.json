I wanted to ask if I could at least drop off Adrian's presents at his therapist today, where we are both allowed to be.\nBut since I typed a \"d\" instead of a \"s\" and you got so offended you won't log on anymore, I'll save my breath and keep him waiting.\nThis style of cooperation, really makes it hard to co-parent from my perspective. But please add \"no typos\" to our OFW rules.\nSent:06/10/2024 at 04:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
