So please understand it’s taking a\nLOT to extend this proposal to you knowing you have already said no- 100% of the time. Like it almost doesn’t make sense to even try at this point\nbut I am going to.\nBut this time one year ago we went to Flo, had a great dinner and we put you on a path to Mirival and me on a path to Whistler. Both trying honestly\nand sincerely to do right by each other. But we came wildly off the rails after and it’s not good for anyone.\nWanna start to fix this with just the smallest gesture of humanity for each other?\nPlease don’t make me sorry I sent this, V.....\nrobert\nMessage 3679 of 4024\nI’m proud of Max. I hope Incheon was ok. I have a good hack if the layover is more than a couple hours I can share. It’s a game changer.\nOctober seems like it could be a really busy month I think that we have Mom, Mediation, Grand Sol Mar. I’d like to map that out with you.\nIt’s so much more than tone. “I’m not ready for that” has only really translated to “I’m ready to continue to have things get even worse”\nWe should acknowledge that, and be deliberate and transparent about our intentions because hate and destruction appears to be sustainable.\nI just don’t want it.\nSent:08/11/2024 at 09:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/11/2024 at 09:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\nMessage 3680 of 4024\nFor upcoming Adrian visit I have below:\nSat Aug 17th - Alan has confirmed (Make up for last week missed due to Orkila)\nSat Aug 24 or Sunday Aug 25 - To confirm date (This gets us back on regular schedule)\nI put in the OFW calendar as placeholder every other week, after Aug 24th.\nI'll add dates in OFW for below.\nOct dates - I suggested weekend of Oct 5/6 to your mom.
