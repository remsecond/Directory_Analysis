I put the link to the website.\nThank you.\nSent:06/30/2024 at 11:43 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/30/2024 at 04:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Rocket Money/Upcoming Bills/Kids spend\nMessage 3393 of 4024\nHey Christine- I think I just moved 55k to that account a couple weeks back. After you took 63k without telling me over the course of four days. I\nhave offered all weekend to talk to you about Canada/Hong Kong/Bills. I have asked to set a time to talk so we don't spend a bunch of money on\nlawyers going in circles. And you keep coming at me. I'm stepping away. Find fuel elsewhere.\nSent:06/30/2024 at 05:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/30/2024 at 10:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Rocket Money/Upcoming Bills/Kids spend\nMessage 3394 of 4024\nI am uncomfortable with discussions with you.\nI wish you well.\nSent:06/30/2024 at 10:27 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Rocket Money/Upcoming Bills/Kids spend\nMessage 3395 of 4024\nCan I send you the Canada authorization for execution? It does not conflict with any time that is scheduled with Adrian.\nYou have not communicated any concerns per request. If you do, please share in OFW email.\nParkers authorization is on hold. Other families are also waiting to finalize plans based on my plans.\nIf you are asking the only way to execute is to talk or go through lawyers, Iâ€™ll reevaluate plans/next steps.\nThank you.\nSent:07/01/2024 at 07:13 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Canada travel authorization",
