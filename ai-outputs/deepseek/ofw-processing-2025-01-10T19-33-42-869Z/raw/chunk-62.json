  "text": "Message 3261 of 4024\nAre we going to discuss or talk about how to make this work at all? It is separate from the RO discussion for example. That’s a matter of law. This is a\nmatter of therapy protocol. It would help if we can discuss.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 04:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 04:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication protocols - Andy guidelines\nMessage 3262 of 4024\nRO addresses communication protocol. Andy engagement falls within communication protocols. I’ll confirm with Natalie.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 04:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 04:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication protocols - Andy guidelines\nMessage 3263 of 4024\nRO is law. This is therapy. I’m not going to jail for not adhering to therapy. You have disregarded Yurushka, Debbie, Dr. Brown, with zero\nconsequences. Plus we never made Dr Brown’s “talk like it’s with your boss” rules as law. I’m not starting with our fifth therapist and for something\nthat we don’t mutually agree to.\nI hope we can chat and be constructive. Thanks!\nSent:06/19/2024 at 04:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication protocols - Andy guidelines\nMessage 3264 of 4024\nMay we please just chat for five minutes?\nI realize you always say it’s unsafe to have a conversation over OFW but that’s what it’s for and what you and I agreed to.\nIf we disagree let’s just acknowledge it. If anyone says something that feels unsafe just hang up. OFW is used for high conflict situations.\nCan we do this please?\nSent:06/19/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication protocols - Andy guidelines\nMessage 3265 of 4024\nHow long did you have these? I was supposed to start using them on May 1st. I’ve been going round and round trying to figure out what the heck is\nSent:06/19/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:18 AM)\nSubject:UAs\nAttachments:IMG_0927.jpg (4 MB)",
