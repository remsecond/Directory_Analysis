  "text": "you hide it and secretly make these moves for something I had earmarked for something else.\nWe had a plan to move money regularly that we agreed to. I noted several times I do not do that to the BofA account because it would screw you.\nYour retort was to show me Safeway grocery charges were mine, and I confirmed they were.\nIf you somehow think $250 equals the $25k you just moved without so much as a peep you were doing it, we have an issue. The bigger problem is you\nare doing this intentionally now with forethought and malice after I asked for a heads-up.\nWhy are you doing this, given we had an agreed-on solution, and I asked you to work with me instead of doing it secretly? As always, we had a plan to\nensure BofA would be funded. Yet you moved 25k without so much as a peep to me.\nThis creates yet another huge trust issue. To repeat myself from last week, how would you feel if I moved huge sums of money out of BofA when you\nwere trying to pay bills? You asked me not to do that, and while I bought groceries, I don't.\nPlease advise, as the entire discussion is in OFW. I am truly baffled at this intentional deception.\nMessage 3108 of 4024\nAre you stealing from us? We just had this discussion Wed, yet today you took another $16k.\nThat's $26k in less than a week, and after we discussed working together in this thread below.\nWhat's going on? Why are you doing this intentionally, knowing it causes issues when you do?\nSent:06/10/2024 at 08:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 09:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nAttachments:FidelityII_1.jpg (82 KB)\nMessage 3109 of 4024\nI’m paying off credit cards. I saw you did your Amex. I need to move to BofA to pay off the Alaska card.\nSent:06/10/2024 at 09:39 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 09:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3110 of 4024\nAll I ask is for you to communicate with me.\nAfford me the same courtesy I give you.\nI have never said no or made it difficult.\nBut you insist on deceiving me, always.\nI don’t get your end game. Can’t we partner?\nSent:06/10/2024 at 09:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 05:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card",
