My fault. I messed with your planning. We can talk more later. These guys really need us to get our stuff together.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 12:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 12:43 PM)\nSubject:Skipping Hoops\nMessage 3760 of 4024\nWow you continued.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 12:44 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 12:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball\nMessage 3761 of 4024\nThatâ€™s unfortunate. I told you specifically I had to get him ready and Alan was there. You kept calling and I went up to grab the phone. They left\nbefore I had a chance to confirm.\nThe email was not forked. You sent me the email with the dates. I confirmed he was signed up and stated tryouts tomorrow.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 12:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 12:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Skipping Hoops",
