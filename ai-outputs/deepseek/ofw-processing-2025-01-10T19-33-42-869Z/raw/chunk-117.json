All the time.\nYou even speak for me. A real talent of yours.\nI am asking how we handle the fact that the kids and I should stay close while you globetrotting. You get that, right? So I am asking how we do that\ntogether. It is our joint responsibility to them as parents.\nHow can I do that without cramping your style but still assuring we have an equal relationship. And assure your family is not defaming me in front of\nthem like your mom did last year with me to you. That’s all.\nSent:07/05/2024 at 07:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/06/2024 at 05:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communicating as You Take the Boys from Me All Summer\nMessage 3459 of 4024\nOk... you disagree.\nDid it get wrapped up or not? There is your answer.\nAre you right or wrong now?\nSent:07/05/2024 at 07:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/06/2024 at 05:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: ToDo List\nMessage 3460 of 4024\nAny ideas on next steps? As noted today, your whole summer disregards the expert advice we got, so I’m hoping we get moving soon for the kids sake.\nBTW- I am not holding you responsible for her pace (unless you are low-key stalling) but at this rate a lot of additional damage is going to be done to\nthem.\nWhat do you think of the books?\nSent:07/05/2024 at 08:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/06/2024 at 05:44 AM)\nSubject:Reunification\nMessage 3461 of 4024\nI just wanted to let you know I’m trying my best. I realize you’re up there at Whistler trying to re-create what I did with the boys and your family last\nyear.\nYou won’t\nSent:07/06/2024 at 01:34 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/06/2024 at 05:43 AM)\nSubject:Fake History",
