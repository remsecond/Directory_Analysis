Mind calling in two minutes. Let’s just put this to bed instead of arguing about what it says. Let’s just read it.\nHow is AD. That’s my real priority. Remember I shared videos of the ship and tracked him the whole time. This has been our jam.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 07:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 07:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up\nMessage 3334 of 4024\nSo... you did your standard drive-by and logged off. Here is what Natalie will tell you:\nMy stipulation is just a temporary arrangement that outlines supervised visitation with AD, specifying six hours every other Saturday, supervised by\nAlan, and includes participation in reunification counseling with Jennifer and me. That is it. Nothing more or less. Done.\nIt is not a comprehensive residential schedule or a complete parenting plan. It does not provide a detailed weekly or monthly schedule, address legal\ncustody or decision-making authority, or cover holidays, school vacations, and other important aspects of our children's routine.\nYou know this gets old and I honestly don't care to make you look bad. And even after all the character assassination that you and your family have\ndone to me, I'm turning the other cheek. Anything else is, as I have said, not good for our kids. Or even me and you tbh. It's not my style.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 08:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 07:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up",
