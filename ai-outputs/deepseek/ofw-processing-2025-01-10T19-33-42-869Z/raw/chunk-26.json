  "text": "Message 3115 of 4024\nI’ll keep $100 and put $500 back today. You secretly and very intentionally took 26k behind my back after we just agreed not to do that. You terrorize\nme and I get scared of what your next move will be. I won’t ask again to please work with me. You will just lie again.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 08:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 08:04 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3116 of 4024\nAnd the 1k and 500 dinners? Is that solo eating or is did someone pay you back?\nSent:06/11/2024 at 08:05 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 08:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3117 of 4024\nIt did not work Sun, as you noted below. You did not show up as promised. Now what?\nEvery day feels like I'm swimming upstream because nothing you say is true or happens.\nI'm sure you get why that bothers me after a year of parental alienation with no plan.\nCan we try this again? Thanks, in advance for fixing what you did not follow through on.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 09:49 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 11:59 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3118 of 4024\nIt is an odd question, right?\nFor years, we have dined where one person picks up the tab, and the other pays them back. This is actually how all group dinner work instead of\nhanding over five cards.\nYou know this to be a fact. Just like you know, our phone bills have a call history. I've run out of ways to explain the obvious to you for the things you\nknow are true.\nYou took 26k from us w/o telling me after we agreed you would not. Intentionally deceiving me.\nI said I don't need the cash if you're not stealing and would deposit it. Please stop harassing me.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 09:59 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 11:59 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card",
