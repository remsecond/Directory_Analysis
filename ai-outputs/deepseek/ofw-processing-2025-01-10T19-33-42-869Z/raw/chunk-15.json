  "text": "Message 3072 of 4024\nI want to clarify that I didn’t say my communications with Adrian caused him distress. I mentioned it was an emotional situation covering a range of\nfeelings, not distress. If you identify anything contrary, please highlight it rather than just say it to create a narrative.\nI agree working with a counselor on child-related matters would be great. I hope we can take their advice seriously moving forward rather than using\nthe internet and lawyers for guidance. It’s important for Adrian to feel supported without being caught in the middle of our issues.\nI also wouldn’t expect Adrian to feel uncomfortable with either of us. It’s unfair to assume emotions are caused by just one parent without looking at\nthe big picture. To explain, I'd start with \"Divorce poison: How to protect your family from bad-mouthing and brainwashing.\"\nAnd before we forget what the title of the tread is, let’s figure out a communication plan that keeps both of us informed about our children's well-\nbeing. I'm not comfortable with your presumed sole custody absent due process and want an effective channel to co-parent safely.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 10:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3073 of 4024\nSounds like you don’t read visitation reports.\nSharing again here to help you find in email.\nI’d encourage you to follow along on these.",
