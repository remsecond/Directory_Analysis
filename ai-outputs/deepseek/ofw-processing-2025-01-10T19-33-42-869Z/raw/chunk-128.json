  "text": "Also- I have nothing. You keep talking about the attorney stuff like we are having an active conversation. I keep telling you itâ€™s not active. We can\ndiscuss that too. Please follow through.\nMessage 3498 of 4024\nIt has been five hours since we agreed to discuss the kids. I worked my day around your work schedule, just as you asked. Please give me a ring, and we\ncan have the discussion we agreed on.\nPlease do not inflame what is already a very hostile situation. I am asking to work with you on the here and now, not the back to school fall plan.\nWaiting on the attorneys got us what today? Zero.\nPlease call, and we can cut it short if we can't make progress, but I'm all in for the kids.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 05:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3499 of 4024\nHey-\nYou called but refused to talk about anything related to the kids. All you did was fight and make accusations. You even piled on about Lisa's\ntestimony. I am trying to ask you to stop fighting all the time and think about the kids.\nEvery single call is all your personal agenda. You just can't help yourself. Even for a moment. May we please have the call I asked for instead of you\nscreaming about Lisa? I don't really care to discuss that. I only care about my kids.\nIs there anything on earth I can do to persuade you to think about Max and Adrian? Anything?\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3500 of 4024\nThis was what I tried to avoid with you today. I see this coming a mile away now.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Step Back\nMessage 3501 of 4024\nThis is what I wanted to discuss, but you ignored. Please respond.\nPlease do not misinterpret or redirect with things I have not said.\nThis is super kids-focused and what I wanted to talk about today.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
