  "text": "Message 3315 of 4024\nI proposed going to Andy. Not selectively deciding what to pick from his therapy based on your plan. This is what you did with Yurushka, Debbie,\nDr Brown, and Kari. Every single therapist we have ever seen, or in this case, have not even seen. I am making it clear that your interpretation and\nselective adoption of therapy rules is not all what I proposed.\nBTW- “Till we get a determination” , I realize you have outsourced your marriage in parenting to a series of lawyers, Susan, James, Annalisa, Natalie,\nbut on my side, I make the decisions. So no “determination” happens without me. I hope you will consider taking control again. This doesn’t work.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 08:49 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 09:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Another Escalation\nMessage 3316 of 4024\nI wish you well Robert.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 09:35 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hangers\nMessage 3317 of 4024\nI find Andy’s protocols for communication very helpful\nIf you disagree then I am uncertain what the intent of your proposal is. It centers solely on rules of engagement for communication protocols between\nthe parties.\nFollowing his suggestion I will step away.\nThank you.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 09:37 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 09:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Another Escalation\nMessage 3318 of 4024\nThe proposal was to get co-parenting counseling.\nYou know that. For you to just selectively say you want to “play therapy” by adopting the rules you like with a referee or professional oversight is\ndisingenuous.\nIf you reach outs and confirm that his whole program is juts following these rules, I’m in. But I am pretty sure we are still missing a key participate in\ntherapy.\nNo comment on the “stepping away.” It’s actually no different than when you are fully engaged. ‘Drive by’ response to poke and then go dark to\nSent:06/21/2024 at 03:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: Another Escalation",
