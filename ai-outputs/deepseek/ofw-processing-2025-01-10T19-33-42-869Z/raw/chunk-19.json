I said that worked.\nThen you pivoted and pushed for more. When I said no, you make it into a big deal, then act like I’m the issue.\nThat’s the same with the calls.\nI’m stepping away because this will get into a back and forth that is a waste of time and energy.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 04:52 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball today\nMessage 3087 of 4024\nI’ve asked for two simple things that you already said yes to. And it sounds like you’re going to poke at me by refusing both now and say you’re\nstepping away.\nPlease don’t make it impossible to coparent with you\nSent:06/09/2024 at 04:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 05:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball today\nMessage 3088 of 4024\nYou have taken away both of my regular visits with AD this week.
