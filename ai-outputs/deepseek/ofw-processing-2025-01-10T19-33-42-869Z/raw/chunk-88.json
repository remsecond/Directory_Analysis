Days tbd. Won’t interfere with any time.\nShall I send you authorization directly or through lawyers?\nI’ve asked Parker parents to hold on their notarized statement.\nIf this is going to be a fight and cost thousands I’ll reconsider.\nSent:06/29/2024 at 07:09 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Canada travel authorization\nMessage 3372 of 4024\nI don't want to argue, and neither do you, really. I think we just sometimes do it to each other out of unhealthy habits. You are pretty good about\nrecognizing it and stopping, so I'll ask for a truce this time.\nI hope you will consider getting help for us; that's all at this point. Trying to win a point here or a point there does more collateral damage than it's\nworth. \"The juice is not worth the squeeze,\" as we said.\nThere is no harm in trying something new at this point. What is the worst that can happen? The courts would probably appreciate it if we could\nproactively agree to some improvements before we see them.\nIf my suggestions make you uncomfortable, I'm all ears... honestly.\nSent:06/29/2024 at 08:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification\nMessage 3373 of 4024\nThe jt BofA can be used for kids expenses as proposed and not personal spend.\nSent:06/29/2024 at 11:17 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 11:23 AM)\nSubject:Kids spend",
