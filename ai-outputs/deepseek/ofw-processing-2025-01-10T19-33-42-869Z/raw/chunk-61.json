  "text": "Message 3258 of 4024\nJust want to say thank you for the two things you decided to help with:\n• Max and AD after Father’s Day\n• Where FF miles are for us/me\nPer this ask, I believe we can do more of that. We don’t have to make war over every single thing.\nI sent an outline of what we agreed to last week along with rules for non-violent communication (including parking lot.) But you just stopped and\nrefused.\nIf you want to propose another way, please do, but I think my note already says that we will only use your rules. And I will follow your protocols for\nthis.\nWanna try to work together?\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Weaponizing Attorneys\nMessage 3259 of 4024\nAny chance you can stop doing this?\nIt just feels like an unnecessary power trip and intentional obstruction. Can we set aside even ten minutes to communicate since you have made it\nimpossible? I really think it would help us.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: You are doing it again\nAttachments:IMG_0923.PNG (251 KB)\nMessage 3260 of 4024\nThe lawyers are discussing communication protocols. I will include in my discussion with Natalie your proposal to engage Andy.\nAs a starter, Andy’s  docs have guidance on protocols he expects for email topics, length, response time etc. Thats a good place for us to start.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:53 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:55 PM)\nSubject:Communication protocols - Andy guidelines\nAttachments:IMG_0409.PNG (453 KB)",
