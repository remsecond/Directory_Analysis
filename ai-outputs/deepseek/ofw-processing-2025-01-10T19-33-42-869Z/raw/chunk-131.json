  "text": "I see that played out in how you engage your lawyers on certain issues, when we cross paths, or have a conversation.\nI hope you find peace one day Robert.\nMessage 3508 of 4024\nYou took my soulmate, my kids, my home, my friends, my reputation. And you lied about it all. Everything- from Kevin, to how we were doing, to\nshrooms, to triangulating with every therapist, to agreeing to Pareto plans, to the TRO, to who you disparaging me to. That list goes on and on.\nNow you are going back to the place where that all that started. Your amazing family. Where no biological fathers are permitted to see the children\nthey fathered with you. Kwans take kids from their fathers 100% of the time. Itâ€™s pretty messed up.\nI wish you well, also.\nSent:07/09/2024 at 08:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 10:04 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3509 of 4024",
