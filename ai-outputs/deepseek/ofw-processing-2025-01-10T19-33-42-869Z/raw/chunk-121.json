  "text": "I’ve obviously powered through our homework books from Jennifer. I’m sure she feels like these are important for us to read and understand so we\ncan be better parents raising Max and AD.\nBut the last two books are only available in hard copy and on Kindle. So I read them and I am realizing that will be a challenge for you given the\nlimited cycles you have and our history trying to find time.\nSo I figured out a way to “de-drm” the books, convert to PDF, and then use an accessibility app to read the book aloud as if you were on Spotify. It’s\nnot as good as Audible but it’s a still way easier.\nIt’s all paid for if we use the family sharing we agreed on to save money. So I’d like to set you up. Then at least you can listen on the way to and from\nwork. I can make this brain dead simple for you.\nPlease let me do what I have always done for us, and give you a little edge or leg up to be more successful. The sooner we operate from a place of\ncommon understanding the better the kids will be.\nPlease let me know... it will take 10 minutes max and save you days trying to find time between meeting to sit and take notes with a hard copy. And\nyou can always go back and do that if you need.\nI hope you’ll let me, help you, help us, help the kids.\nThanks!\nMessage 3474 of 4024\nThank you for the offer. I am good.\nStrange on availability as I thought I I ordered them in paperback version. They should be at the house when I return.\nSent:07/07/2024 at 10:35 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:35 AM)\nSubject:Re: Help w/ Required Reading\nMessage 3475 of 4024\nI am tentatively thinking this evening. I can send a message once we are back.\nSent:07/07/2024 at 10:36 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Moyer International Travel Plans\nMessage 3476 of 4024\nThey are in paperback. But what I’m saying is I have a way for you just to listen while you drive or walk. So you can read them more quickly. The\nbooks are us, 100%. They could have just used our names.\nSent:07/07/2024 at 10:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 02:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Help w/ Required Reading",
