That is consistent with all the professional guidance I\nhave, including things that Dr Brown told us both.\nI have always said I want them to enjoy this trip. Always. I just want to do it in a safe and responsible way. So my hope is you will listen to professional\nadvice and meet in the middle for the boys sake.\nLet me know if you have questions!\nMessage 3451 of 4024\nBTW- can we just establish up front if we are going to work together today on knocking out any issues? I realize you are busy and so am I, so don’t\nwant to get wrapped around a sprocket waiting for a reply to a proposal or something and have you dark for 12 hours. It will just frustrate me if you\nsay something is urgent and tune out. Happy to establish a check in time if that works to make decisions. Thanks!\nSent:07/05/2024 at 08:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3452 of 4024\nI am driving to Whistler today, with a car full of kids.\nI understand you have our counter proposal for the temp proposal.\nFor Hong Kong, I am unaware of any conditions that would make it unsafe or irresponsible, which you state below are your concerns.\nSent:07/05/2024 at 10:22 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 10:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3453 of 4024\nI don’t know what you are talking about.
