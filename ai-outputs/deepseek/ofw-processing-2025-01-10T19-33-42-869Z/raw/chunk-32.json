  "text": "The market, in general, is pretty healthy. That said, I do watch and make moves that maximize our gains. I have always done this, and the market has\nnever beaten me.\nWhile I do not claim to be an expert, I feel like I am super lucky or have enough domain knowledge in the tech sector to make reasonably sound\npredictions.\nExamples include exiting Tesla, entering Nvida, and selling AMD and MSFT at 52-week highs. You would have been out on those moves and lost\npotential gains.\nSo... if we wanted to consider an approach where I sell something (AMZN or AMD) and we spilt those proceeds now w/o splitting everything, it\nmight behoove you to consider.\nI am not going to die on this hill. I will continue to manage my portfolio and try to do what I have always done. But if you want to slipstream off that,\nI am happy to continue.\nIf you do not understand what I am saying or think I am trying to do something nefarious, I will be doing it to myself as well in this scenario, which I\nhave no interest in doing.\nWe may be fighting like cats and dogs right now, but long term I want you to be as successful as we always have been. And I'm rooting for you for you\nto do great things.\nI don't like you right now, but I still love you and always will. I'm happy to explain or discuss.\nMessage 3143 of 4024\nI need to process what you are saying\nSent:06/12/2024 at 05:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea\nMessage 3144 of 4024\nI can make a slide to show you. Then we can talk through it. Itâ€™s pretty simple if I give you a sketch.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 05:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 06:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea\nMessage 3145 of 4024\nok\nSent:06/12/2024 at 06:18 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 06:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea",
