I assume that it\nwould be used for discretionary spending. The net being is we don't want to pay for each other's Botox or massages.  We would need to agree on that\ndefinition, but we could do that.\nSo, if that is the case and the lawyers are interpreting your ask correctly, I will proceed. If that is not the case and the lawyer <-> lawyer\ncommunications are not aligned, I am happy to just wait till they figure it out, or you can tell me. But whatever it is, I don't care to argue or fight. I'm\ntrying to help you so it's not worth the argument.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 07:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea\nMessage 3147 of 4024\nI’m watching GAL stuff. It’s very scary. He has full legal rights to ALL our texts and emails. Did you guys talk about that at all? We have so many\nnaughty pics. I know we won’t ever be together again but the idea of another man seeing your pics and our dirty conversations makes me sick, sad and\nqueasy.\nDo you know if there is any way to be able to not turn over the intimate stuff. I can’t stop crying right now over the idea of someone else seeing you\nnude that way. It’s not their business. It has nothing to do with this. Plus I sent a bunch of b*ner pics. But that’s his problem. But in the white\npanties!!! It’s too much...\nSent:06/12/2024 at 08:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 08:30 AM)\nSubject:Uhmmmm\nMessage 3148 of 4024\nIf I had known that I would have insisted on a female\nSent:06/12/2024 at 08:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 07:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Uhmmmm\nMessage 3149 of 4024\nI thought you deleted them all.
