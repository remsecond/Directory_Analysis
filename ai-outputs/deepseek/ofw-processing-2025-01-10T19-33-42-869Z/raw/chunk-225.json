As we discussed, it is a simple request to address outstanding issues without including the attorneys. But I don’t know what\nyou are expecting if you are not responsive. Please help me figure out how.\n• On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's\nbeen fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?\n• On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.\nI have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.\n• On 8/17, after asking several times about our Seahawks tickets, I tried to make some progress. Obviously, AD's decision to honor his wishes matter\nSent:08/29/2024 at 11:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/29/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:May We Please Work Together?",
