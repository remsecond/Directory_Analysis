Court is your choice.\nMy POV is, the decision to have lawyers engage in this discussion is waste of money but your decision and choice and your money.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 08:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 08:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3524 of 4024\nBlocking what? Cabo was an issue you raised last minute, over the holiday weekend, using your lawyer. We responded immediately on Monday.\nThis is documented. We can share details and timeline with Rosen if you want to blame.\nYour lawyer is blocking if they have not shared with you and no way for you to respond.\nWhy did you use your lawyer on this issue at the last minute, if you really wanted to align without lawyers?\nSent:07/10/2024 at 08:37 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
