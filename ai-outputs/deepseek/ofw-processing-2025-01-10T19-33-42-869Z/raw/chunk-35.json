You should be as aware of what was shared as I am. If I have seen any pics that were of an adult nature, I\nhave deleted them. I have told you that many times and it is still true. I obviously sent pics too. Please let me know if you have done the same.\nMy concern below was about handing a “complete history” of our texts and emails where something could still exist. Not to mention the fact our\n“complete history” won’t match each other. If you are going to turn this into another harassment opportunity I’m stepping away.\nSent:06/13/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 01:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Uhmmmm",
