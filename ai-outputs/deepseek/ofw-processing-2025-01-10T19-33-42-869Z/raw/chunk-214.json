  "text": "Katharine sending you our contact info. Reachable at all times for emergencies..\nUliana is fully vetted and knows the boys well. She also has your contact. You can also reach. Elsa if needed.\nMessage 3807 of 4024\nI have the info and am fine.Thanks for that.\nNone of your explanation makes sense. And the fact that you have health info from the cardiologist that you have not shared is disappointing.\nYou still have not given me any way to contact the person who left AD in a confusing state yesterday and wandering the parking lot, late for pick up.\nI’m surprised that all of this seems perfectly ok.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 11:18 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 11:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3808 of 4024\nInfo from cardiologist was shared that night and day after. Nothing has changed. I had a conversation with a cardiologist specialist in this area who is a\nfriend of friend that I initiated and felt comfortable with what Seattle Children’s shared. Yesterday they scheduled a zoom follow up with max in a\nfew weeks. No additional tests ate needed as they had said at this time.\nElsa has her information. She is Stephanie’s daughter. You have also met Stephanie who as you know lives 5 mins away and I presume you have\nStephanie contact information.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 11:59 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 12:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3809 of 4024\nWe are where we are. I have contact info. That is what I was most concerned about. Katherine understands why and sent that to me. Hope you have\nfun.\nThoughts for future discussion:\nI’d like to see the ER visit notes and follow up instructions, please. Not sure I can track all the modalities of communication that night z\nI don’t know Stephanie who lives 5 Minutes away. Or her daughter who is in charge of my kids. I just know what I saw yesterday was concerning.\nWe are on day two of having this person I didn’t even know existed, be in charge of my children. I assume it’s all good. I honestly trust you vetted her.\nBut yesterday you saw we crossed wires on both the drop off and then the pick up. Adrian kept asking to call her so we could figure out where she\nwas.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 01:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids",
