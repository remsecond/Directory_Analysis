It’s great news to hear. I’d like to stay updated but I assume this means you blocked me where we were communicating all\nnight.\nSo now I need to move here to track emails rather than actually communicate and ask questions. That is super unfortunate. But I am at your mercy.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 12:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3722 of 4024\nWhen can I ask questions for the doctor since you are our only mouthpiece and have gone from email, to text, to call, to text, to OFW in the space of a\nfew hours. It’s really hard to chase you down and communicate in a timely way when I’m playing Where’s Waldo about my son’s heart condition.\nPlease ask:\n• What might have caused this AFib episode, and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?\n• What kind of follow-up or monitoring should we do to keep an eye on his heart health?\n• Is there anything long-term we should be concerned about, or could this be a sign of something else?\nBeyond my family history, if you remember this time last year I was solving his cardio problem. I think that was a total of five appointments in three\nweeks? I also track everything with his medication and ADHD treatment. I hope you will involve me next time. I know more about Max and his\nhealth and medication than anyone alive, including him. I can help.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 12:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 03:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3723 of 4024\nMax is home and resting.
