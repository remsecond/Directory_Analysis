  "text": "FYI, the latest visitation report from Alan for Adrian and I is attached. We had an excellent time as always.\nDuring our last visit, Adrian was really focused on making sure his room was ready here, as we had put it off in the past given our circumstances. We\nspent about an hour and a half getting it set up, which wasn’t mentioned in the last report. The first thing he did when he arrived was run downstairs\nto check if everything was still good to go, and it was.This is important to him.\nLater, we looked through pictures on my phone since all the family photos had been removed from his house. I did this to show him that he comes\nfrom\na place of love and ensure that we are all included in the pictures. We had a great time reminiscing, and Adrian enjoyed telling \"his own stories\" behind\nthe pictures. I texted him the slideshow so he could\nkeep those memories close and promised more.\nInstead of our usual action movie, Adrian wanted to watch \"IF,\" a childhood movie about a 12-year-old who keeps a picture of them and their parents\nfrom better times. The story is about not losing a parent and honoring family memories. It was incredibly poignant and hit close to home.\nFortunately, the movie had a happy ending with the child reuniting with their dad. Talk about a tear-jerker.\nAdrian's last two basketball games were tough, with emotional meltdowns. This time, I was able to spend time with him beforehand. He really\nenjoyed\nthe game, was happy, laughing, and during the game, he came off the bench and said, \"Nothing is wrong, Dad. I just wanted to tell you how much I\nlove you.\" For a 12-year-old boy, doing that in front of his team was a big deal to me. A WOW moment.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 02:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications",
