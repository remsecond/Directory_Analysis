We have made those exact jokes for years. I thought you would see the\nhumor. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. There is no threat whatsoever. I don’t understand how you could just turn on a dime when this\ntime last year we were having lunches every day, sex three times a day and still had our regular date nights. This seems inconceivable. But I respect\nwhere you are at and will not make jokes in bad taste again. Please forgive me.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 04:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Please call",
