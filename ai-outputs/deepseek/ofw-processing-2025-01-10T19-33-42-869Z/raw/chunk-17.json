  "text": "I am grateful Adrian got an opportunity to remember what we truly were for a bit. Even if Christine and I disagree on adult issues, he sees nothing\nbut love and support for what we were as a family. The visits gives him time, space, and permission to honor the part of himself that he has lost\ntouch with. Lots of laughs, wrestling, and healthy teasing made us feel normal for a few hours.\nMessage 3074 of 4024\nYes I read Alan’s reports.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 04:11 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3075 of 4024\nAdrian asked not to attend tonight.

I think I’m missing something here?\nSent:06/09/2024 at 04:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3078 of 4024\nDid you have a timeframe for the two second switch for urgent and or emergency coms?
