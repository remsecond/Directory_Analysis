After months of intense emotional connection, I kissed you and our kids goodbye as you left for\nHong Kong. The same people never returned. The moment you landed, you were bombarded with a stream of hate and vitriol. Our daughter missed\nher flight, and somehow, this was all your fault because you got the boys on the plane but not our 31-year-old.\nIt was as if a long-dormant emotional monster, held inside for the last three decades, was suddenly unleashed. Elsa berated you relentlessly, telling you\nover and over what an awful mother you were and how you had ruined her life. It was unbearable, and then you asked me to step in; the abuse was\nsoul-crushing, and to be honest, you sounded as if you would break. Even as I tried, I could not stem the tide of Elsa, the blame, the hate.\nIn the following days, you revisited the same spots you frequented when you were pregnant as a teenager, staring at the harbor with the sights and\nsounds of Hong Kong in full effect. The vibrant colors of the city, the bustling streets, and the smell of the sea must have triggered a flood of\nmemories. My heart aches for the emotions you must have felt and the onslaught of painful memories you endured on the heels of the assault.\nThen you talked with Lilian, who piled on with stories of me being drunk on a visit before the pandemic. I had embarrassed your family and never\nbeen back to apologize. This was unforgivable, and she let it be known what a coward I was for my absence, not apologizing face-to-face even years\nlater. I deeply regret this incident and acknowledge that my past actions seriously strained our relationship. For that, I am genuinely sorry.\nOur minds, fresh from our own spring of self-created amateur “mushroom therapy” to help ease our own trauma and PTSD scars, were perhaps also\nopen to triggers we were unaware of. It was the downside of uncontrolled experimentation with neuroplasticity, And we would never be the same. All\nthe pain, anguish, and deep hurt came out in our next phone call. After all that was happening and a well-deserved reason to blame me, I became the\ntarget.\nAfter the best months of our life as a family and married couple, I was the problem now and had been all along from this point of view. Everything\nthat had happened and gone wrong since leaving Hong Kong was my fault. Then, after you landed, Max told me that in Hong Kong, you had decided\nto divorce me when you all got home. Since then, my life has been rewritten, and others have taken over my marriage and parenting.\nThe changes have profoundly affected our children in the last year, who left that day as happy and optimistic kids and now see us as lifelong enemies.\nMy primary concern has always been their well-being, and I am committed to maintaining a healthy relationship with them even as this explodes\naround us. I have continued to take steps towards sobriety and reconciliation and worked hard to improve myself as a parent.\nSent:07/01/2024 at 06:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 07:05 PM)\nSubject:6/30 An Anniversary of Sorts\nAttachments:Screenshot_2024-07-01_183008.jpg (431 KB)",
