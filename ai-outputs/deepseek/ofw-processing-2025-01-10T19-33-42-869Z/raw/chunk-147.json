You sent me every memory in our house. They are in boxes downstairs. That is visibility. Why do you say\nthings like this? Are you just denying reality to poke at me? Is this like Kevin, where I have the evidence in my possession, and you say it is not real?\nThat is crazy making. Please stop that kind of communication. It is counterproductive.\nOh, and I know you refuse to engage.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 11:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Stripping\nMessage 3562 of 4024\nI know that Connor and Jennifer are engaged.\nSo were;\n• Yurushka: Weekly Family Dinners\n• Debbie: New Moyer Traditions\n• Dr Brown: Multiple Parenting plans\nHow is this any different? At all? I have seen the movie. I know the ending. You ALWAYS say \"wait till XYZ says what we should do.\" Then ignore it.\nIt's so repeatable that its a joke to act otherwise.\nSo, will you not do anything short-term, knowing you always ignore the long term?\nSent:07/11/2024 at 12:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Truth - please stop these types of comminications\nMessage 3563 of 4024\nThanks so much. Can you suggest a protocol so I can crack the code? Since you have not allowed me to give gifts to either of my children without\nmulti-week delays and an act of God? I'd love to sort this out. Blocking gifts from the target is a cut and dry alienation so please work with me.\nI know you are erasing me, but I owe it to the kids to try and find a place in their life despite you.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 12:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:55 PM)\nSubject:Re: Gifts From Dad\nMessage 3564 of 4024\nI disagree with many of your statements below and interpretation of events.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 12:44 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Therapy and Decision Making",
