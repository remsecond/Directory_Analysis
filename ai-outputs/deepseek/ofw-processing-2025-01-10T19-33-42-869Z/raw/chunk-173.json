  "text": "Our kids, the finances, the house, nothing?\nYou won’t work on anything?\nMessage 3656 of 4024\nCan you use OFW for communication please.\nI still see multiple emails.\nFor Adrian, I noted your email communication in regards to his telephone call.\nI’m not comfortable sharing my thoughts with you as it does not feel safe for me.\nEither way, our interpretation is just that, our POV.\nAs Adrian is speaking with both Kari and Jennifer, they are in a good position to determine his perspectives, separate from how you or I may view or\ncommunicate a situation.\nOn a positive note, we have witnessed Adrian become increasingly more comfortable verbalizing how he feels, and addressing a situation\nindependently. I have noticed a marked change this year in his communication style and confidence. I am very proud of him.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 07:23 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 07:23 PM)\nSubject:OFW/Adrian\nMessage 3657 of 4024\nSo you are privy to information that would help me be a better Dad and help his mental health.
