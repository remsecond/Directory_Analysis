Always. You are never comfortable. You always make it worse. I can’t think of a single time when you\nsaid “yes I’m comfortable bringing the temperature down.”\nWhen I see you insisting that we do the one thing that has made this intolerable and intractable that lets me know that you are in no mood to\ncooperate and you are only gonna continue to escalate things.\nThis has gone on for months now. We have tons of emails with me asking for this. If you have a change of heart and actually want to work with me\nand bring the temperature down, let me know. This is not it.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 11:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 11:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: Truce?\nMessage 3558 of 4024\nPlease read my response.\nI clearly said yes to bringing temperature down.\nIf bringing temperature down only happens if we chat, that is an ultimatum on your part that It appears I must agree to.\nIt is unclear what you are saying if I don’t chat.\nYes bring temperature down.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 11:38 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 11:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: Truce?\nMessage 3559 of 4024\nI read your response. It’s the same response I have seen for the last year. Actions speak louder than words. Doing the same thing over and over and\nexpecting a different response is insanity. This does not work, never has, and only makes things worse.\nI got it\nSent:07/11/2024 at 11:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Truce?",
