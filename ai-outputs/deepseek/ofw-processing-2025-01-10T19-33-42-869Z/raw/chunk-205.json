It helped us communicate in quick twitch situations. I don’t think I abused it and it felt like healthy communication.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 08:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 08:24 PM)\nSubject:See Hotmail...\nMessage 3774 of 4024\nHey- if you would like to chat, let’s chat.

That is illegal in the state of Washington.\nCash balance in the Jt Fidelity account was $7,348 that you took as yours and applied to the margin position. Apple just put a 400 cash dividend in\nthere.\nCourt Order says no margin activity in the Jt Fidelity account.\nCourt order says only children's expenses from Bank of America account. Your personal expenses have removed over 5K which has dropped the\nbalance below the 10K court ordered amount. To date I have not seen this replenished.\nYour lawyer asked for my credit card balances as of June 12, by end of week, but has refused to share your balances. This should be excluding legal\nfees.\nThere should have been no withdrawals of cash or sales from other Fidelity account that you have denied me access to.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 11:32 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 11:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safe Communication",
