  "text": "I am fully committed to cooperating with professionals, including Connor and Jennifer, to ensure the best possible outcomes for them. I hope for a\npositive co-parenting relationship with you, and I am dedicated to providing a stable, nurturing environment for Max and Adrian. My goal is to move\nforward constructively, focusing on the well-being of our children and the potential for a harmonious family dynamic and will continue.\nI have done so much research and pored over books, presentations, and white papers, all of which I am happy to share with you. But please know that\nIt is very possible that the intense emotional experiences and unresolved past traumas, combined with mushrooms, triggered a mental regression in us.\nPsychedelic substances sometimes unlock deep-seated memories, bringing them to the surface in unexpected and overwhelming ways.\nThe sudden flood of painful memories and unresolved trauma, especially those tied to your formative years in Hong Kong, could have caused an\nintense psychological reaction that may have led to a well-deserved sense of anger and overdue blame towards me that had been simmering for years. It\nwas what we talked about fixing before you left. Understanding this does not excuse any harm I have done, but it might help explain the instant\nchange.\nOur passion burns white-hot on both sides of the coin. There is no in-between with us. We went from being the two most seemingly in love people\nthe world had ever seen to mortal enemies. So for one moment, just a moment, please, after 30 years together, fighting like cats and dogs and\nsnuggling toes and making love, consider the fact that perhaps we flew too close to the sun and our wings melted. But let's remember who we were,\nacknowledge who we've become, and see if we can forge a new path of understanding. But we don’t have to hate each other.\nIt's been a long year. May we please consider a change?\nMessage 3409 of 4024\nI asked Adrian how he knew the details of your Bellevue home, including rent, as you implied I told him. I have been very careful not to discuss this.\nHe indicated that he saw this on your computer screen at the Old Bellevue place, says he saw the rent of 7,767 or something like that.\nGiven that this information came from you, I trust you will correct the record for anyone you have shared that I gave him this information.\nSent:07/01/2024 at 07:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 08:03 PM)\nSubject:Adrian/details of Bellevue home\nMessage 3410 of 4024\nThe number is wrong but I have not shared that with anyone. Did I say that in anything you saw?\nI wish you would not go to him and question him about our conversations. I don’t know what your intentions are, but it shows him things he says to\nme might result in an interrogation for mom. Like the California thing I thought we cleared up.\nLet’s don’t blow it out or proportion though. It’s a thing we can work on. Not a big deal.\nAnd today was a win! Neither of us got what we wanted but we did not yell or hang up on each other. We both communicated some outstanding\nconcerns without loosing it. You also let me apologize for past comments and name calling. To me that’s a start!\nIf we can keep it up we might make progress! Let’s decide if we can make some more quick decisions that make us both equally unhappy...\nThanks again!!!\nSent:07/01/2024 at 08:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 05:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian/details of Bellevue home",
