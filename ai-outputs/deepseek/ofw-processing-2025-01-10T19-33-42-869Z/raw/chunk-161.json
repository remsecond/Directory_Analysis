I had so much faith, trust, devotion.\nWhat a fucking fool I was to put my faith in you.\nAnd I did right after you had just jettisoned Leo.\nI deserve exactly what I got for being so stupid.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 08:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/12/2024 at 05:01 PM)\nSubject:July 4th\nAttachments:IMG_1605.PNG (12 MB)\nMessage 3611 of 4024\nApologies for my frustration. I want you to know that I am going to do my level best to keep my heartbreak  to myself. I can only hope you realize\nthat I felt like I won the lottery when I met you.\nAnd I thought we had turned the corner. I was the man you asked me to be. And by making the changes you asked me for, would grow old together. I\njust never imagined this was even possible.\nI miss my best friend dearly. I always will...\nSent:07/12/2024 at 12:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/12/2024 at 05:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3612 of 4024\nI’d like to start over here. I’d like us to use the platform to deescalate rather than entrench and become even more estranged and acrimonious.\nWanna give it a shot?\nSent:07/12/2024 at 12:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/12/2024 at 05:01 PM)\nSubject:OFW Reset\nAttachments:IMG_1608.jpg (4 MB)\nMessage 3613 of 4024\nOr are we never talking again? We know what got us here, so my hope is you don’t double down. Isn’t it time to try and find a peaceful way to\ncoexist?\nSent:07/12/2024 at 05:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/13/2024 at 06:17 AM)\nSubject:Are you going to reply?",
