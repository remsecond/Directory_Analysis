  "text": "Message 3516 of 4024\nSo, are you going insisting on going to court?\nYou knew the attorneys were out. And also see I am trying to work towards a peaceful agreement between us to so we don’t go to court. Are you\ninsisting on no peaceful collaboration and only Rosen? You hung up and said see you in court on Friday. I don’t want that.\nSent:07/09/2024 at 06:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3517 of 4024\nCabo was remaining issue as noted last week in your response. Rosen could have been cancelled last week but for whatever reason your side made\ndecision to hold Rosen to resolve cabo if no agreement on this one issue reached.\nIn my POV that is strange and expensive to hold Rosen for this one issue but strategy you decided to take.\nThe money in attorney fees generated by Cabo discussion is an interesting choice on your side but it is your choice and spend.\nSent:07/09/2024 at 06:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 06:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3518 of 4024\nI am asking to work with you and find a peaceful resolution. Our attorneys were out, I said that, you knew that, and insisted on them when they are\nout of the office. That is what took so long. You knew this.\nCan we work this out? You are blocking now.\nSent:07/09/2024 at 06:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3519 of 4024\nI have questions I would like to get answers for. That is all.\nYou hung up without telling me your position and have refused to discuss it. You know our attorneys have been out, but still insist on them handling\nit in their own absence. That is not a sincere effort and intentionally inflaming our situation to force me to go to court now.\nI am asking to avoid court and work together so we don't waste time or money. Are you still going to make me wait for court to figure out the\nanswers? That makes no sense as we have been going back and forth here for the last 1.5 hours. Just explain the situation to me.\nWas this the end game all along ?\nSent:07/09/2024 at 06:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
