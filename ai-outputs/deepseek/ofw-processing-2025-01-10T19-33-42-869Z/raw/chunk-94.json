Too much is lost between the time differences in one-line responses.\nIf you are uncomfortable, stop the conversation. But I really would like a constructive conversation.\nIf we agree on a time for the call you already made once, we can start the week on a positive note.\nLet's try our best for Max and Adrian, Christine.\nSent:06/30/2024 at 08:21 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/30/2024 at 11:34 AM)\nSubject:Re: Did You Call?\nMessage 3391 of 4024\nFor bills rocket money identified as upcoming from the jt BofA account - See attached which are your personal bills.\nFrom prior communications, I understood you were not impacting that account, however as noted below and attached, and based on Rocket Money,\nyour personal bills are still coming out of funds in this jt account.\nI saw a Safeway purchase yesterday using your debit card.\nAs these bills have not yet come out of the account - you can go into the accounts online or call, and update so have these bills paid from your credit\ncard or out of your personal BofA account.\nSent:06/30/2024 at 11:41 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/30/2024 at 04:51 PM)\nSubject:Rocket Money/Upcoming Bills/Kids spend\nAttachments:Bank_of_America_Joint_Account_-_Robert_Bills_1.docx (253 KB)",
