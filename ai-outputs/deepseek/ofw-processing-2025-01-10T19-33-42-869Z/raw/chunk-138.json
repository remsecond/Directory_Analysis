  "text": "You must be sooo pissed I found out about your secret relationship with a married couple-worker. What a fly in the ointment to the “I’m all right”\n“he is all wrong” narrative. Do our friends know about Kevin or do they think this was all me? Just curious.\nMessage 3528 of 4024\nlol... the idea that you would ever open your mouth about wasting money on this divorce shows how completely delusional you are about your role.\nBTW- custody battles cost millions. You have not even begun to scratch the surface on our financial ruin. Was this how you and Lilian penciled it out\nafter you moved all the Kevin stuff to a secret personal folder?\nSent:07/10/2024 at 09:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 09:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 3529 of 4024\nI’m actually really happy but thank you.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 09:33 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 11:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 3530 of 4024\nI wish you peace Robert.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 09:36 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 11:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 3531 of 4024\nYou crack me up. You spend all morning writing tomes berating me and insulting me then coming back with your \"I'm so Zen\" replies.\nWe could have thrived in retirement, and our kids' childhoods would not have been ruined. We would not be burning generational wealth that they\ncould have had to make their family's lives better.\nOh, I know you are good. There is a DSM definition for people who have notions of grandiosity and zero empathy for the harm they cause to others,\nincluding their own children. It is quite detailed.\nI wish you peace, Christine.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 11:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 11:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)",
