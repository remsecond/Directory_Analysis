I am asking for a peaceful\nconversation.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 12:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about\nMessage 3624 of 4024\nGetting back to me later today is not going to help me with what Adrian needs to bring.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 09:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 09:11 AM)\nSubject:Adrian Today\nMessage 3625 of 4024\nI appreciate the prep. May I ask when the last time you checked the mail was? I was supposed to have a letter late last week that did not make it.\nLooking forward to a healthy conversation later. I will say that even though it was a bit spicy earlier, I felt like you were honestly listening. I appreciate\nthat.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 11:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 12:25 PM)\nSubject:Thank You!",
