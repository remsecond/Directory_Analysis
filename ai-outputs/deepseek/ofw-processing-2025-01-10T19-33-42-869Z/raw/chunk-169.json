Nothing we sell will be settled before you leave now. Since I will have zero money, what would make you\ncomfortable?\nShould I just borrow from BofA till we get the most immediate need settled? Happy to wait till you are back for the big split so we can be thoughtful.\nThanks!\nSent:07/15/2024 at 02:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 03:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Near Term Money\nMessage 3640 of 4024\nHow much do you need to borrow?\nSAAS payment is due.\nYes for AMD.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 03:08 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 03:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Near Term Money\nMessage 3641 of 4024\nYour mails and communication scare and make me uncomfortable. .\nSent:07/15/2024 at 03:09 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 03:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about",
