  "text": "Message 3215 of 4024\nI have been trying to work with you all day. And you refuse and then say you don't understand\nI want to talk about the kids and what get some feedback so we are better co-parents for them.\nI have a ton of questions about the bills and finances. I am trying to work with you, but you won't.\nCan you please call for five minutes so we can stop this and figure out how to move forward?\nSent:06/17/2024 at 09:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/18/2024 at 05:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: What is the deal\nMessage 3216 of 4024\nIt’s a bummer to waste another day. And I don’t expect tomorrow to be any different. It never is.\nSent:06/17/2024 at 11:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/18/2024 at 05:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: What is the deal\nMessage 3217 of 4024\nI won’t talk to you when you pepper the communications with statements with digs and issues you state as facts and are not. I have stated repeatedly I\nrefuse to defend or refute because that’s how you draw me into a longer conversation and confrontation.\nYou then accuse me of not working with you.\nThe finances are a known, the timing and what the amounts we need to pay are. They are due Robert. The mortgage, the tuition. To act any different\nis disingenuous.\nThe spend we have/had was based on two incomes. You have decided not to participate in that anymore. You have since increased your spend. I\nbroke down the chase card. I am 12.5% of that spend. You will see the breakdown.\nThe result is you have put me in a situation where I am now reliant on you to sell stock to pay my expenses. This is another way you have decided to\ncontrol me.\nI have asked to split finances immediately.\nThe delay is another example of your attempts to control.\nThe travel authorization. People are waiting for you to return that to either finalize plans or decide if they need to change plans.\nWe have Cabo as a proxy of what you will do. You refused to return it despite saying you are not saying “no”.\nI have a full work day. I have demonstrated how you will repeatedly interrupt it. This is another example.\nSent:06/18/2024 at 05:23 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/18/2024 at 07:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: What is the deal",
