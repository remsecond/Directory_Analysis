Let me know if you have issues accessing\nMsft fidelity account - Per agreement - there should be no cash payments, money movements or stock sales. Please confirm.\nJt Bank of America - There is still some of your personal spend from that account which should just be for kids, if you can deposit back in. Please\nconfirm\nI sent you a list a while back of all your expenses that were hitting that will need to be stopped. Let me know if you need me to resend.\nSeahawks - I set up an excel for us to pick tickets. You can have first pick. Let me know if you have issues accessing.\nSent:08/05/2024 at 12:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/05/2024 at 10:05 AM)\nSubject:Kids Expenses/Funds/Wire from Fidelity\nMessage 3677 of 4024\nWill be pulled from jt BofA.\nSent:08/05/2024 at 02:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/06/2024 at 08:42 AM)\nSubject:SAAS tuition\nAttachments:IMG_1105.PNG (186 KB)\nMessage 3678 of 4024\nThank you for the message. I agree a more friendly tone is much needed. I appreciate the outreach. I am glad you had a good trip to Bali.\nMax arrived home yesterday. It was a bit of a journey to get him home, but a learning experience for him.\nI saw your moms message for a visit. I sent some dates, Oct 5/6 work well for me. She said she is getting your feedback.\n... are all out of town this weekend. Any chance you and I can take a deep breath and try to smoke the peace pipe? I would love to sit down and talk a\nlittle about how we get those two crazy people we have seen over the last year to be kind to each other again.\nIt’s the one thing we have not tried... but when we used to do it, the risk/reward curve was always in our favor. I solemnly swear not to talk visitation\nat all. Hell we don’t even need to talk “running list” at all. We can just find a way to be peaceful and graceful to each other, in a public place.\nWouldn’t it be a Christmas miracle if the kids came back to town and mom and dad (both equal parts of their whole) could actually communicate\nand put them first. I honestly believe at some point the courts will ask us to do it anyway, so let’s just impress the hell out of them and beat them to\nSent:08/11/2024 at 07:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/11/2024 at 09:34 AM)\nSubject:The Kids",
