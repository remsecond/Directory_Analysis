  "text": "You use your lawyer, then it seems you are asking me not to respond through my lawyer? Thats strange.\nYou are continuing to make the decision to have lawyers manage this issue. If it’s solved then that’s all you needed to tell them but you have not.\nAgain you sent this through your lawyer over the holiday break, then they left town.\nWhat was expectation on your side for reviewing and managing a response? I did not see in your letter, I’m sending this over the holiday weekend,\nbut because I will be away when you respond, please have Christine respond directly with Robert.\nHow was Lisa supposed to cancel Rosen if she’s gone?\nIt appears your strategy was never to cancel Rosen as that would have been impossible given Lisa is out and could not review any response after the\nholidays.\nI guess I have my answer.\nWe will be discussing Cabo solely on Friday. All other matters are resolved. It should be quick but cost thousands.\nMessage 3525 of 4024\nYou have spent 10x the amount of time it would have taken to discuss this, to instead put me down, insult me, and place blame. Young made that\nchoice and it is documented here.\nI’m not your supply Christine. Find some other poor idiot to abuse. I’m focused on problem solving.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 08:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 09:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3526 of 4024\nI think history shows this was Natalie’s choice. Keep choosing your own reality. It’s been amazing!!\nSent:07/10/2024 at 08:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 09:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3527 of 4024\nWe discussed last night. We agreed the ball is in our court and said we would make the meeting happen. I will send her an email with you cc’d as we\ndiscussed so we can help Max and AD for a change.\nYou are sooo bitter. Sooo hateful. It’s almost like you and Lilian didn’t really think this through. It all seemed so simple and easy to take everything\nfrom me for yourself and blow up the Moyers. Easy stuff!\nYou could have just started with therapy and a cooperative divorce. But you could not. Your condition does not allow for that. You have to place\nblame in a binary world. There is no grey for you.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 09:04 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/10/2024 at 09:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)",
