  "text": "Message 3045 of 4024\nPhew!!! I was worried you would see this before I admitted I was being frustrated in my tone about yesterday. Apologies for that. Sometimes it gets\nthe best of me. So just let me know when I can drop off his gifts!

This is a very simple ask. I can do it before the play date or after. And I’m not going to the Rudolph’s.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 03:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 03:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3048 of 4024\nIf you are asking to come to the house, the answer is no.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 03:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 03:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3049 of 4024\nI am asking you for your rules about giving my son his presents. I am not trying to force myself on anyone or any place. That is what this thread says-\nyour rules. I am happy to meet you at Sbux and do a drop-off or exchange. This is in AD's best interest.\nIt is healthy for him to see I care about him. I am 50% of him and when you teach him to hate me, you teach him to hate himself. Please let me know. I\ncan meet you as you go to the play date or after your workout if that makes it easier. This is a reasonable ask.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
