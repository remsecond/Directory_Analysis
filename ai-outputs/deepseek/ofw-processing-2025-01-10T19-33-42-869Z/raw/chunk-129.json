  "text": "Message 3502 of 4024\nHere is what I had asked of you that I wanted to reach an agreement on as well for the kids:\n\"’l'll just wait till everyone is home before reaching out.\nAre there things I can ask about that you all did so we can have a natural conversation and it not feel like “spying.”\nI want him to feel at ease and see we are aligned when it comes to him. We don’t keep secrets and this is normal.\"\nPlease let me know so I can engage in a way that he feels comfortable. AD has not picked up in five days, and that gives me pause with your travel\nplans and our inability to work together on healthy solutions. You did not even answer this.\nI'll also ask that you give Max his gifts that I have sent to the house. It is important that the kids know that even while you have declared all our war on\nme and removed every single reference to me in their lives, that I still think of them.\nIf this is going to be like my meds or UAs, and you are just going to refuse to give him my gifts, please let me know. I'll obviously have to make it a\nlegal issue, but I REALLY do not want to do that for something as simple and reasonable as this.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moyer International Travel Plans\nAttachments:CupNoodlesforMax.JPG (333 KB)\nMessage 3503 of 4024\nYour position is there is no reason the kids do not have time with you.\nThere is no reflection or acknowledgement of the cumulative and long lasting impact your actions over the decades have had on all of us.\nTo attack the family that provided support and protection to kids and I, and to yourself over decades is telling.\nTo state it is all heresay is also telling. Why even look from that viewpoint unless you intend to deny all the incidents or take the position that everyone\nis lying.\nYou did everything that was been outlined. Every one of them.\nYour position is either we are all lying or yes you did it, but ignore the impact.\nUltimately we all know the truth.\nIf you are able to convince Connor or others,  what has been described were lies made up by me, kids, family and friend’s, that will be informative as\nwell. Everyone who has been impacted will have their own perspective and view of that outcome, but facts don’t change.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
