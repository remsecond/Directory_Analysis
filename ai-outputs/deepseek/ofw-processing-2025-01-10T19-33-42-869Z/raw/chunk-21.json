Thats different than what you say below. Context matters right?!\nI don’t want to fight. Let’s let it all go. You and I bickering just makes things worse. It’s not going to help AD and Max to pin blame at this point.\nLet’s both just look forward to having an adult look at this situation and decide if the events of the last year + make sense and were healthy for our\nkids.\nI’ll say it again, Christine. I would like to work with you instead of outsourcing our jobs as parents to your lawyers. After four of them, I’d love a shot\nw/ you.\nPlease let me know.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 09:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 3096 of 4024\nYes.\nConnor is engaged. Honesty is critical in that process.\nSent:06/10/2024 at 07:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 07:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 3097 of 4024\nI’m sorry, I don’t understand what you’re saying.\nI think I asked to quit outsourcing our parenting.\nWould you like to have a discussion then?\nHave a great day\nSent:06/10/2024 at 08:00 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/10/2024 at 08:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
