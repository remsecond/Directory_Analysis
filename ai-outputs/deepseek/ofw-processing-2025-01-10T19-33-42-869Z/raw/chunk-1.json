  "text": "Message 3011 of 4024\nPlease speak to your lawyer.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 07:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:09 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3012 of 4024\nYou did not answer on BofA spend. Do I cancel your debit card as it’s unauthorized?\nMoney withdrawals are happening and actual spend. Debit card fraud is incredibly difficult to get reimbursed if fraud so we need to notify bank\nimmediately. If you don’t answer I’ll get attorney guidance on this. You have stated you never spend in that account.\nApply for your own Visa. That will track your spend and is your personal liability.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:05 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3013 of 4024\nMy lawyer is on vacation. I am asking you.\nHow would you like to coordinate so I can participate in Adrian's birthday?\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 10:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3014 of 4024\nYou canceled them, not me. You know that.\nYou also know it has to be booked +1 years in advance. That makes it 'not this year'. You intentionally canceled mine. I am not going to re-document\nwhat is detailed at great length.\nAlso, you take luxury vacations all the time—again, all documented in painstaking detail—and not to Grand Sol Mar. So I'm asking if we can agree on\na reasonable equivalent together.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:18 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 10:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Missing 10k",
