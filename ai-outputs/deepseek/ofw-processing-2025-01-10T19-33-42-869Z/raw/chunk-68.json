We can figure out how to get the things I asked for another time. I think we agreed you would stop donating things in the garage that\nare either mine, or are joint that you have not asked about. PCs come to mind. Also, no really is no reason to fight in front of Max. I’m really sensitive\nto that and it’s like clockwork in front of him. You can see the discomfort on his face. Please stop it.\nSent:06/20/2024 at 02:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hangers\nMessage 3291 of 4024\nI'm offering to chat again.\nI don't think it's in Max and AD's best interest to have our lawyers say false things and escalate back and forth. You and I should work together for the\nkids. If we can chat, you will get nothing but positive cooperation.\nPlease stop making this so damn personal. Even during our divorce, we were still having dates and making love till your lawyers stopped it. We\nhonestly don't have to hate each other, and I think it is really counterproductive.\nHow many times have I asked?\nSent:06/20/2024 at 05:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:26 PM)\nSubject:Another Escalation",
