I saw tryouts are tomorrow during your time.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 02:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 02:39 PM)\nSubject:Adrian basketball\nMessage 3732 of 4024\nSorry. The first line is not about you. Natalie used a forked thread that presented a different picture of what actually happened when communicating\nto Conner about Hong Kong.\nI had said explicitly that I was not going to block the trip, but the fork made it appear like was doing that to “play games”. She said I was “playing\ngames” in three emails after that.\nBut I don’t want to fight. I have the email. It could have been a mistake. And it is not directed to you.\nNo gotchas. I’d like to smoke the peace pipe. Want to\ngive it a shot? We really were on a roll yesterday. Two days in a row. And the we had an unlucky spanner in the works (see what I did there? )\nI certainly will abide by Max’s wishes. Thanks.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 02:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 04:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3733 of 4024\nNo, I have not been involved in any of his planning. School, sports, or extracurricular. I’d love to start to be included if I may. Will you please\nconsider it?\nSent:08/16/2024 at 02:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 04:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball\nMessage 3734 of 4024\nYou are using this thread to air a grievance?\nSent:08/16/2024 at 04:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 04:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3735 of 4024\nSent:08/16/2024 at 04:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 04:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max",
