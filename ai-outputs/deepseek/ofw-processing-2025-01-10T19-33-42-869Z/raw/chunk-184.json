I have done all I can to give you time and space, but you refuse to even make the smallest gesture\ntowards peace.\nAnd I’m not sure I can stand more hostility.

I’m all ears.\nSent:08/13/2024 at 01:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/13/2024 at 03:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: 15 mins\nMessage 3693 of 4024\nI’ll step back.\nLess than 3 weeks ago you sent an email asking if I was coordinating child abduction.\nSent:08/13/2024 at 03:21 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/13/2024 at 03:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: 15 mins",
