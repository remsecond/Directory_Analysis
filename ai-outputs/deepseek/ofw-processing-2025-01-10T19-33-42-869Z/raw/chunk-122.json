Please be safe.\nI’ll just wait till everyone is home before reaching out.\nAre there things I can ask about that you all did so we can have a natural conversation and it not feel like “spying.”\nI want him to feel at ease and see we are aligned when it comes to him. We don’t keep secrets and this is normal.\nSent:07/07/2024 at 10:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 02:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moyer International Travel Plans\nMessage 3478 of 4024\nBack in the US.\nSent:07/07/2024 at 09:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 09:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moyer International Travel Plans\nMessage 3479 of 4024\nAcknowledged.

It is based on professional guidance from Dr. Brown, a well-respected Co-\nParenting counselor I see, and consistent with the books Jennifer has asked us to read. It is the healthy thing to do.\nI'd also appreciate your partnership getting us all together with Jennifer ASAP, before HK for sure. I don't think there is an argument, so please let me\nknow if you disagree. I honestly hope we start with an intervention since Kari refused, but we will let Jennifer decide of course.\nSo, I'd like us to agree that we will both move heaven and earth for our boys. It starts with making sure that the people and processes we have agreed to\nadopt and follow happen promptly—i.e., Jennifer's plan. Running out the clock does not make sense for anyone.\nNo time like the present to do the right thing for Max and Adrian. We on the same page?\nSent:07/07/2024 at 10:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 11:16 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
