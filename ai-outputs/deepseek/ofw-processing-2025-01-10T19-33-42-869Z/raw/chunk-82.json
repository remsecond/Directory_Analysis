  "text": "Message 3349 of 4024\nWatching the documentary on Netflix. It’s interesting of course, but in a weird way to me. All these people who were happy, and did not want to\nblow up their home life, their family, all they had worked for. But after ten years, they lost their spark. The bedroom just was not happening anymore.\nSo they did this.\nCrazy. Crazy. It makes me reflect of course. Especially on my pleas for counseling last spring. We were the opposite. We had it all. And bed was\nunquestionably the hottest and most incredibly intimate place we could be. After 30 years it could not have been better. Crazy. Crazy. At least we\nwent out on top there.\nAnd then we blew up everything else that mattered.\nCrazy\nCrazy\nSent:06/22/2024 at 07:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/23/2024 at 06:43 AM)\nSubject:Ashely Madison\nMessage 3350 of 4024\nAlright, you're doing your daily thing where you ask a question and immediately log off, so by the time I hit send with the answer a minute later (and\nyou know I am sending it within a minute) you are long gone and won't check in again.\nI asked for peaceful collaboration using non-violent communication as the tool (since I read the nook as recommended) to work on some important\nkid related dispute resolution that will be stuck in our lawyers for weeks to come. You refuse to work with me again.\nThere is literally nothing I can do to get you to work with me constructively or even so much as communicate in an unhealthy way. I say unhealthy\nbecause just getting back to that would be a major improvement over the way you do it today which is almost non-existent.\n• During the work week you always have an excuse not to parent with me.\n• During the weekend you always have an excuse not to parent with me.\nYou honestly parent like you plan on me dying and will never see our kids again. Please do not complain if we do not reach any decisions that the\nlawyers are negotiating now. I tried again.\nSent:06/22/2024 at 08:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/23/2024 at 06:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: Have a sec?\nMessage 3351 of 4024\nSee Andy’s guidelines. 100 word limit and time to respond.\nI’m not going to meet in person or chat.\nAny ask is peppered with statements that have accusations. Given I know your aggressive position I’m not going to engage as that’s when anger comes\nSent:06/23/2024 at 06:43 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/27/2024 at 02:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Have a sec?",
