  "text": "Message 3504 of 4024\nThis is a lie. You attacked the statements made saying they were heresay. Talking to you is triggering as you deny your actions and impact.\nI wish you well.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:56 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 07:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3505 of 4024\nYou have misstated my position entirely. You *always* tell me what my position is.\nI have acknowledged my past actions many times, Verbally and in writing to you.\nI have not attacked anyone in the Rudolph family: period, Not a single word.\nThe rest of your accustaions are simply your own. I respect you can have a POV.\nI'd like to work with you on the kids' issues, not your personal agenda if you may.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 07:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3506 of 4024\nI would suggest we figure out a way to communicate before you plan to leave the country with my kids. You have called it home for you and the boys,\njust came off an international trip where you cut off communications. And now you going to the place where you covered up your affair with Kevin\nand then worked with Lilian on an exit plan. And that is where you plan to stay. That's an issue.\nLet's please bring the temp down and work together here.  We can do this just like Sat.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 07:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3507 of 4024\nI was reflecting on why you might be continuing  to send emails such as below and what your goal might be.\nPerhaps you believe it will scare or intimidate me or perhaps shame me. What is clear is a need to elicit a reaction from me.\nWhen I see you write things such as below, I reflect that the narrative of being a victim continues, a need to validate your POV, and resorting to\nbullying behavior and tactics that may have worked in the past with me.\nSent:07/09/2024 at 08:14 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 08:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week",
