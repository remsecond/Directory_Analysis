  "text": "Message 3817 of 4024\nWelcome back...\nI hope it’s fair to ask the status of our kids supervision at this point since you are back on the grid. I feel like I was exceptionally patient given the\ncircumstances. And when you have a moment I’d love to know why it was essential to keep it all a big secret from me.\nI’ll add that the one time I was able to reach the kids, it was a one minute phone call with AD. I asked about the sitter to be sure he had her number.\nHe got weird and immediately asked to get off the phone without answering. He said he would call back and never did.\nI’d prefer to have a reasonable dialogue rather than test the expectations of the legal system at great monetary expense and further strain an already\ntoxic and counterproductive relationship. A week ago we agreed to strongly consider divorce counseling.\nThank you\nSent:08/25/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/25/2024 at 07:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nAttachments:IMG_3907.PNG (8 MB)\nMessage 3818 of 4024\nSo you saw this and left me blocked. I don’t want to make an assumption but your actions don’t point towards our agreement last Sunday.\nMind confirming? Obviously I was dead serious about turning the page on the kids behalf. If you no longer share that sentiment just let me know.\nOr don’t, and I have my answer.\nSent:08/25/2024 at 06:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/25/2024 at 07:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Why did you do this?\nMessage 3819 of 4024\nObviously I’d like to join tomorrow night. Just let me know how you would like to do that. Obviously we did it last year and were perfectly nice to\neach other. I even think we agreed we would treat each other as husband and wife for the kids, just in a new way.\nThanks!",
