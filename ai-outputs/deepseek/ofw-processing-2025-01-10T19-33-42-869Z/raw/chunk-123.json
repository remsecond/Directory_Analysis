Adrian had nothing booked and I’d love to have Max and Parker over for a sleep over.\nLet’s talk about how we can make something happen so we both have healthy relationships with the boys.\nThis is especially important given Hong Kong.\nThanks!\nSent:07/08/2024 at 10:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 11:17 AM)\nSubject:Kids This Week\nMessage 3482 of 4024\nThe co parenting counselor you have engaged needs to be fully aware of all the issues at play to be able to provide appropriate guidance. That was the\npurpose of Connor and Jennifer to help connect provide the safe structure for time with kids.\nIf that person is to assist in healthy communication between us then that would be welcome.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 11:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 11:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3483 of 4024\nApologies, but you are not speaking to my questions and concerns. You sidetracked on the therapy I am doing and telling me how it should be done.\nWhile I’ll take your feedback and do my best to assure we get appropriate advice, can we please focus on the actuall substance of my message?\nIf you would not mind re-reading this mail and responding in a timely manner as that was the reason for sending, it would be appreciated.\nFWIW- I have quotes from Dr Brown as well. She was pretty engaged. In fact she knew more than anyone does and said this is a bad idea.\nPlease do not drag this out with misdirects. Thanks!\nSent:07/08/2024 at 11:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 11:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\nMessage 3484 of 4024\nJennifer and Connor have been engaged to assist with parenting plan which focuses on time with them, and reunification with the boys.\nYour co parenting counselor is welcome to speak to them to share her thoughts and perhaps get information on issues at play.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 11:38 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 11:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week",
