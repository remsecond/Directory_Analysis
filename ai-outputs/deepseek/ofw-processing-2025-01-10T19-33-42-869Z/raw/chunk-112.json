  "text": "Any chance I could see AD? Or even Max and Parker? I watched them all, event free last summer. It would be super nice if so, otherwise I’m all alone\ntoday.\nThanks for your thoughtful consideration!\nMessage 3438 of 4024\nI have been talking to AD this morning and it sounds like it's just video games on the agenda.\nMind if we play ping pong and have lunch together? I am happy to accommodate of course.\nSent:07/04/2024 at 11:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 11:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3439 of 4024\nWe have plans.

We could have spent the morning together instead of him playing video games. Frankly, he has\nno idea what's happening, so I assume it is not a big deal.\nPlus, it can't be a tradition. The 4th of July was the biggest holiday of our year. Our tradition. The boys and I had everything planned, and the beach\ncamp was prepped early, ready to pamper MOM. It was our family's big day!\nI guess I am just super hurt. You take every holiday, every break, everything. Even the things that were solely focused on us just chilling as a happy and\nhealthy family together and being thankful for each other. I have all the pics!\nI feel like I'm dead to the family, and it's not right, especially after your secret 4th last year.\nSent:07/04/2024 at 12:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 05:34 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3441 of 4024\nSo Bellevue downtown is going to be great. It’s all set up and ready for a show. Can I grab him?\nYou never do fireworks. You never even do the 4th. You’re from Hong Kong. This day is just always me trying to make us happy as a family, having us\nall together at the beach or over bbq, to celebrate us and what we have done. Teaching the boys how to take care of a woman and make her feel\nSent:07/04/2024 at 06:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 07:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th",
