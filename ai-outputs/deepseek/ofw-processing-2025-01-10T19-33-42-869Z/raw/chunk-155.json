Everything. I did not push back on a single demand. Nothing. You refused when I tried to work with you\nto honor your commitments, even after giving away or canceling 140-person nights at a five-star resort that I could have used. You went above and\nbeyond to screw me, cancel me and give away community property.\nYou did not compromise or work together on a single item—nothing. Even though you have a full salary and our cheaper home mortgage because of\nmy decisions to purchase and refinance, And, you actually stalled both of those things. Although you never had an issue with the cost disparity when I\nwas in the dump in West Seattle, you just won't allow equity in our lives.\nOf course that's the money. You have stolen 99.9% of our kids.  I'll focus on that theft now.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 03:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 05:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Rosen\nMessage 3598 of 4024\nI am seeing things today that really make me worried. I am not trying to bash you at all. I am honestly asking if you need help, a break, or some time to\ncollect your thoughts. Or perhaps you are just too busy to think things through properly. I have been there many times and it's ok.\nBut I am genuinely concerned about you, Christine. Can I help?\nSent:07/11/2024 at 04:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 05:05 PM)\nSubject:Are you Ok?",
