Nothing is more important to our children's welfare than creating a safe environment, so I created and executed everything on\nmy \"todo\" list to demonstrate my intent. That is not meant to be an escalation. It's an effort to find peace with you.\n• No flames  for any reason\n• Write up and share Kari notes\n• Write up and share Alan notes\n• Tackle your Excel todo list\n• Find and start DV classes\n• Attend meeting with Jennifer\n• Go to ADs hoops tryout\nI agree to keep the tone friendly, but I also hope to move the ball forward for the kid's sake. May we consider meeting with Jennifer at least to discuss\nthe topic together? It can't hurt.\nMessage 3833 of 4024\nPerhaps after the DV person provides their perspective?\nSent:08/27/2024 at 06:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/27/2024 at 06:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Miracles happen to those who believe in them\nMessage 3834 of 4024\nThanks.\nI completed the list. That bullet is included.\nI am happy to share with you and Jennifer.\nMay I set up a meeting to discuss this now?\nSent:08/27/2024 at 06:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/28/2024 at 11:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Miracles happen to those who believe in them\nMessage 3835 of 4024\nWe should probably discuss the next visit if you have not. I think getting back to the “regular schedule” is a week off between you two.\nI think in his mind, next weekend is the original schedule he is trying to get back on track for. I am not sure you have that in mind.\nI think the two hour Conner Saturday visit was the exception to his regular schedule. Have you had any discussions or should we talk?\nthanks\nSent:08/28/2024 at 04:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/29/2024 at 07:27 AM)\nSubject:Alan",
