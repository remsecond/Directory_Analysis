I felt like this was a pretty good explanation of our family. Of any family. Recognizing the dysfunctional past\nwe shared.\nI thought we were on the same page, making hard won progress. I wish I knew you felt differently so I could have tried to do even more. I just didn’t.\nWhen this all happened, you were my world. I would have done anything humanly possible for you. I tried to show you every day- lunches, dates,\nwalks, sex.\nI honestly believed what I was seeing.\nSent:07/13/2024 at 01:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/13/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Our Books\nAttachments:IMG_1444_1.PNG (147 KB)",
