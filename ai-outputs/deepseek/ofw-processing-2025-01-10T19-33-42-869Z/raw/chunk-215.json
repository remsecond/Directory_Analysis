  "text": "Not really a big deal, he is just an anxious kid. But I’ve asked multiple times for contact info. You have refused to provide that for my kids caretaker.\nMaybe this is a good test to resolve something peacefully between us, we clearly disagree on. Im committed to turning the page as discussed.\nHave a blast, stay dry and we will talk on return.\nMessage 3810 of 4024\nSo... since you are not going to provide contact info, my ask is that AD goes to bed at a decent hour. He is always exhausted when he gets here and it\ntakes a while to warm up.\nThis may be even worse tomorrow if he has the freedom to stay up extra late playing Xbox because he has a sitter. I like him to be rested and ready for\nthe home visit Sat.\nI hope you can understand why that is important.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 02:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 02:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3811 of 4024\nThey are good. Thank you for checking.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 02:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 02:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3812 of 4024\nSorry... not what I asked. I assume they are good.\nI am asking that she makes sure AD is rested for tomorrow’s big visit. It means a lot to me that he is his normal self, not sleepy, tired, unengaged AD.\nWe talked about this with Jennifer. I don’t want to spend half our time doing thumbs up or down.\nNot an issue for now but let’s reach a friendly agreement on caretaking for our children. And help me understand why it is so important to keep her\ncontact info a secret from me. It just gives an odd appearance, right? Especially after yesterday.\nI’d really like to get off OFW. It’s not good for our attempts to repair and get into divorce therapy.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 03:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 04:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids",
