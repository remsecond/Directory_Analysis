Have fun off the grid.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 04:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/25/2024 at 04:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3815 of 4024\nI have been incredibly respectful and restrained. Even when we were having our disagreements I did not bother you. At all.\nI was very intentional while we are deciding if we start divorce therapy under Jennifer’s guidance for the kids. That was our deal.\nI trusted you all week and we were a team. At least I was, even when you went dark (and I still didn’t bother you.) about it.\nWhy would you go in and block me as we try to turn the page to be nicer? What signal did you mean to send by doing that?\nYou had to take the time, knowing I am doing my best on every item on your todo list, and intentionally block me.\nWhy would you do that secretly? So now it’s back to the attorneys? We talked about all this. I thought I had your word.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 07:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/25/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Why did you do this?\nAttachments:IMG_3908.PNG (233 KB)\nMessage 3816 of 4024\nWe were able to do the visit. Seemed to go fine. Alan had car trouble so he was late but still just before Conner. AD seemed a bit anxious about the\ndelay so it would have been nice to tell whoever is in charge of him that things were delayed but no need to worry.\nAs you said below- not an issue for now.\nStay dry!\nSent:08/24/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/25/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids",
