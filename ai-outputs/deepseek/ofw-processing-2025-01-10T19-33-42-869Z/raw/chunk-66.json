  "text": "Want to just meet in the ymca parking lot? It’s public and probably 1/2 way. Open to other ideas.\nI presume you want to use standard tv show hostage swap protocols? Put it down, walk backwards slowly, hands in the air, no unexpected movement.\nThanks for the cooperation.\nMessage 3278 of 4024\nThanks for getting back to me on everything all at once. That’s super helpful. That said, I think if we look at all our emails we appear to be very\ntriggered.\nI’ll follow your lead and work with you on the items that you need a response on. But I don’t think today is a day to push on little things. We are\nfrustrated.\nWe have said we “need the tools” for months, even years. It’s why we are where we are. Any chance you will consider trying to acquire some? We need\nit.\nWe won’t solve that here. So I’m hopeful we can descalate. You and I really are better than this. Please know that I’m at your service and happy to\nhelp.\nSent:06/20/2024 at 08:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 08:48 AM)\nSubject:Issue Resolution\nMessage 3279 of 4024\nI love these... when he gets back we can share them with him!\nSent:06/20/2024 at 09:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 11:42 AM)\nSubject:AD\nAttachments:AD_6_20.jpg (266 KB)\nMessage 3280 of 4024\nOk-\nRather than triggering a fight, I am just moving $35k to BofA from MSFT now. It's at a 52-week high and ready for some pullback.\nIf I do it straight from Moyer, I think we might have to cover the margin first and I'd rather do it my way than fight about that.\nI am happy to work with you on fine-tuning our monthly move. We can get this dialed in till we divorce. It's not rocket science.\nJust let me know. That would take a huge stressor off of us. We did the Porsche together and even made a killing. Let's work together.\nAccounting should be the easy part. There is no flesh and blood to fight over!\nSent:06/20/2024 at 09:34 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 11:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Tuition/expenses",
