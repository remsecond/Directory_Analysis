There may be others. No personal withdrawals or personal spend with debit card\nfrom jt account.\nSent:06/29/2024 at 12:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 01:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids spend\nMessage 3376 of 4024\nThoughts or go through lawyers?\nSent:06/29/2024 at 12:03 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 01:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada travel authorization\nMessage 3377 of 4024\nMy thought is we can talk and probably work through several things together.\nI honestly do.
