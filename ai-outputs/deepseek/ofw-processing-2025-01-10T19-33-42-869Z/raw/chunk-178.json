Confirming Sat Aug 3\nMessage 3674 of 4024\nAlan asked today if I had a preference for Saturdays or Sundays. I don’t at this time but it could change depending on Adrian’s schedule and any extra\ncurricular activities. just lmk.\nBtw- I noticed you still have personal charges running through the jt BofA account. I saw AT&T, rocket money, comcast, Safeway, your cares\ninsurance, Amex payment etc. see attached.  Can you deposit those amounts back into the jt account. I totaled at it was about 2,510.48 but lmk if you\nsee different. I saw one vanguard still went through for kids savings so I’ll cancel that. I’ll split the Safeco insurance and let you know your share.\nMy understanding is that no personal spend from jt BofA, the msft fidelity accounts etc.\nHope Bali was good.\nSent:08/03/2024 at 11:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/03/2024 at 11:20 AM)\nSubject:Adrian/Alan\nAttachments:IMG_1064.PNG (453 KB)",
