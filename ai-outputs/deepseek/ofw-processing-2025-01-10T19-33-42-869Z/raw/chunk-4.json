  "text": "Message 3024 of 4024\nHey-\nI don't want to escalate this any further than you already have by emailing me with Natalie CC'd. You know she has sent numerous messages to Lisa\nabout pursuing legal action against me if I do anything that violates your admittedly wrong RO. That feels like an attempt to get me to do that.\nThis whole thing boils down to the fact that you are taking a statement by me so literally that it's counterproductive. You secretly took $10k from an\naccount where I said the money was earmarked. I responded by saying I don't do that to our BofA account so you could manage bills.\nIn response, you've gone through and picked out my grocery bills at Safeway, a $300 withdrawal, and a single bill pay to create some false equivalency\nas if you're catching me out. Then used that to ask me If the activity was fraud. I confirmed below that no action was necessary from you.\nSo, from my perspective, it feels like you're playing games. Between the email with Natalie CC'd, ignoring the fact that I said no action is necessary\nbelow, and the comparison between my grocery shopping at Safeway and you taking $10k, I feel like you are harassing me now.\nI also sent an OFW message earlier today asking that we stand down as we are too triggered, and it would be counterproductive. You agreed but then\ndoubled down 'off platform.' I don't know how to work with you, Christine. Please consider a more constructive way for us to collaborate.\n-robert\nSent:06/05/2024 at 04:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 06:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3025 of 4024\nAre we good here? The lack of acknowledgment to the answer you keep chasing me for feels intentional. Is there even the smallest effort you can\nmake?\nSent:06/05/2024 at 06:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 07:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3026 of 4024\nTo solve the grocery money caper, 13 messages were swapped here and three on email. When I proposed our truce, I asked we put those disagreements\naside and focus on this one issue.\nI haven't heard back from you in over 12 hours. Please don't make your issue Adrian's issue. I saw him on T-Day, Christmas, and many times since.\nI'd like to see him for his birthday, even briefly.\nPlease let me know how I can see the child that I delivered 12 years ago, was called mini-me till you did this, and whom I have had endless capers with.\nI am a part of him and always will be.\nPlease let me know how to work with you to make it happen subject to your rules.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 07:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
