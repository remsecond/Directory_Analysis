We did not\nwrite this language, it came from you.\nWe approved the Cabo language drafted and approved by you on July 3. Cabo was not an issue.\nAll issues were agreed middle of last week July 3rd.\nWe asked to reschedule Rosen on July 3rd.\nYour lawyer sent back revised language for Cabo on Friday July 5. Your lawyer was aware everyone was out for the holiday weekend. She had receipt\nof out of office replies stating as such with return on Monday. This was only issue remaining but there was no indication to cancel Rosen on your\nside, as we requested. You continued to reserve right to have Rosen decide this issue.\nWe responded Monday July 8 am, once everyone was back in the office. Again we asked to reschedule Rosen if this was one remaining issue. Your side\ndid not agree to do so.\nThis has cost you thousands.\nAll documented.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 07:09 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 07:09 PM)\nSubject:Original temp orders sent by your lawyer and approved by you\nAttachments:IMG_0645.JPG (3 MB)",
