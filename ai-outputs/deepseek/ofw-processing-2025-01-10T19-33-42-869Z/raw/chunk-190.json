Are we sure it has to be replaced not repaired? Do you have a couple opinions so it’s not the most expensive opinion?\nRemember the water heater had to be replaced unless I asked the exact right question. Just want to be sure you are not getting the “woman answer”\nThanks\nSent:08/14/2024 at 08:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/14/2024 at 10:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Garage Door\nMessage 3709 of 4024\nIt has to be replaced now.\nIn April I called them as it was not functioning properly. At that time they could get it back on the rails, but it is so old (17 years) you could see it\ndegrading and they indicated it would just keep doing it. It was a temp fix. I got a quote then.\nMax bumped the garage door on Monday with the car. He has started driving. That was enough to push it completely off. I forgot he had done it and\nhit my button and made it worse.\nI have them coming out on Sunday to look and give another quote.\nWe have used them each time, including the condo. If you want to recommend another service feel free.\nSent:08/14/2024 at 11:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/14/2024 at 11:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Garage Door",
