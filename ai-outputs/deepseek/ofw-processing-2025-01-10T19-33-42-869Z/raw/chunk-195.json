  "text": "Message 3724 of 4024\nLooking for an update please.\nNothing is normal. Zero about last night was normal. Sanity has left the building.\nIf you can help answer the questions I asked that would be appreciated since the two of you completely blocked me out of this discussion.\nLet’s request the tapes today.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 08:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3725 of 4024\nHe’s doing well and in good spirits. His heart rhythm bs k to normal.\nThey said this should hopefully be a one and done. Have follow up appointments to see more specialized to get answers to questions below.\nYes please request the tapes. That is not my priority today.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 08:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3726 of 4024\nReference to “block from both of us “ is inflammatory.\nMax had multiple confidential discussions with Seattle Children’s and has ability and right to ask and share certain things. I was not privy to those\nconversations as they asked me to step out each time. If you have an issue with Max’s decisions please raise it with Jennifer directly.\nIf you had concerns with actions Seattle Children’s took please also raise those directly with them.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 08:33 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 08:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3727 of 4024\nThanks you. I’m glad to hear that Max is physically okay after last night’s scare. I am concerned about the mental aspect, especially the screaming\n\"Robert stay away\" into the phone. That isn’t normal, and we should consider accelerating therapy as he is getting worse.\nRegarding his medication, as you know, Dr. Kwon involves me in discussions about Max’s Vyvanse—his dosage, diet, and overall health. Last time,\nwe agreed to reduce his dosage to 30mg and emphasized the importance of taking it daily, especially since he lost 10 pounds.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 08:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Max",
