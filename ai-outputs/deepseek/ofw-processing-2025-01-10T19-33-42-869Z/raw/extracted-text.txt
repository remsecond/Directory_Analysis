You did not answer on BofA spend. Do I cancel your debit card as it’s unauthorized?
Money withdrawals are happening and actual spend. Debit card fraud is incredibly difficult to get reimbursed if fraud so we need to notify bank
immediately. If you don’t answer I’ll get attorney guidance on this. You have stated you never spend in that account.
Apply for your own Visa. That will track your spend and is your personal liability.

You canceled them, not me. You know that.
You also know it has to be booked +1 years in advance. That makes it 'not this year'. You intentionally canceled mine. I am not going to re-document
what is detailed at great length.
Also, you take luxury vacations all the time—again, all documented in painstaking detail—and not to Grand Sol Mar. So I'm asking if we can agree on
a reasonable equivalent together.

You never get it. Everything is transactional for you. It’s more than the investigation. I’m talking about the well-fair of our kids and keeping that part
of them safe. So they can love and appreciate who they are, not feel shame. I’m trying to approach this in a holistic way where we can honor our past
and not trash each other and that includes friends and family.
Your response is always that it’s time to tell the truth. You’re tired of lying to people. I’m pretty sure that it’s up to you what you tell them about our
past just as it is for me. I’ve been mum on all the things that we did. At the time we did them because we liked it. You, by contrast have started an
advertising campaign of destruction and defamation.
So I’m asking if can we agree to stop doing that and work on honoring the years we spent together. If you don’t understand, please take some time off
work and educate yourself. It’s not a knock, you just don’t  know. So I’m asking you to learn how your vengeful flamethrower approach is impacting
the kids.
Frankly, I’m tired of having this discussion. All our messaging platforms are replete with examples of me, trying to get this under control and not treat
each other in horrible, thoughtless, and inhumane ways that screw up our kids for the rest of their lives. I’m actually tired of trying to convince you to
parent responsibly. It’s clear you don’t get it.

Hey-
I don't want to escalate this any further than you already have by emailing me with Natalie CC'd. You know she has sent numerous messages to Lisa
about pursuing legal action against me if I do anything that violates your admittedly wrong RO. That feels like an attempt to get me to do that.
This whole thing boils down to the fact that you are taking a statement by me so literally that it's counterproductive. You secretly took $10k from an
account where I said the money was earmarked. I responded by saying I don't do that to our BofA account so you could manage bills.
In response, you've gone through and picked out my grocery bills at Safeway, a $300 withdrawal, and a single bill pay to create some false equivalency
as if you're catching me out. Then used that to ask me If the activity was fraud. I confirmed below that no action was necessary from you.
So, from my perspective, it feels like you're playing games. Between the email with Natalie CC'd, ignoring the fact that I said no action is necessary
below, and the comparison between my grocery shopping at Safeway and you taking $10k, I feel like you are harassing me now.
I also sent an OFW message earlier today asking that we stand down as we are too triggered, and it would be counterproductive. You agreed but then
doubled down 'off platform.' I don't know how to work with you, Christine. Please consider a more constructive way for us to collaborate.

AD and I had a particularly emotional situation over the two days you blocked all access over his B-Day and day after. You would not allow that to
happen.
That’s alarming to me and imho shows a consistent disregard for him, and working with your co-parent.

I want to clarify that I didn’t say my communications with Adrian caused him distress. I mentioned it was an emotional situation covering a range of
feelings, not distress. If you identify anything contrary, please highlight it rather than just say it to create a narrative.
I agree working with a counselor on child-related matters would be great. I hope we can take their advice seriously moving forward rather than using
the internet and lawyers for guidance. It’s important for Adrian to feel supported without being caught in the middle of our issues.
I also wouldn’t expect Adrian to feel uncomfortable with either of us. It’s unfair to assume emotions are caused by just one parent without looking at
the big picture. To explain, I'd start with "Divorce poison: How to protect your family from bad-mouthing and brainwashing."
And before we forget what the title of the tread is, let’s figure out a communication plan that keeps both of us informed about our children's well-
being. I'm not comfortable with your presumed sole custody absent due process and want an effective channel to co-parent safely.

Sounds like you don’t read visitation reports.
Sharing again here to help you find in email.
I’d encourage you to follow along on these.
—————————————————-
FYI, the latest visitation report from Alan for Adrian and I is attached. We had an excellent time as always.
During our last visit, Adrian was really focused on making sure his room was ready here, as we had put it off in the past given our circumstances. We
spent about an hour and a half getting it set up, which wasn’t mentioned in the last report. The first thing he did when he arrived was run downstairs
to check if everything was still good to go, and it was.This is important to him.
Later, we looked through pictures on my phone since all the family photos had been removed from his house. I did this to show him that he comes
from
a place of love and ensure that we are all included in the pictures. We had a great time reminiscing, and Adrian enjoyed telling "his own stories" behind
the pictures. I texted him the slideshow so he could
keep those memories close and promised more.
Instead of our usual action movie, Adrian wanted to watch "IF," a childhood movie about a 12-year-old who keeps a picture of them and their parents
from better times. The story is about not losing a parent and honoring family memories. It was incredibly poignant and hit close to home.
Fortunately, the movie had a happy ending with the child reuniting with their dad. Talk about a tear-jerker.
Adrian's last two basketball games were tough, with emotional meltdowns. This time, I was able to spend time with him beforehand. He really
enjoyed
the game, was happy, laughing, and during the game, he came off the bench and said, "Nothing is wrong, Dad. I just wanted to tell you how much I
love you." For a 12-year-old boy, doing that in front of his team was a big deal to me. A WOW moment.

I am grateful Adrian got an opportunity to remember what we truly were for a bit. Even if Christine and I disagree on adult issues, he sees nothing
but love and support for what we were as a family. The visits gives him time, space, and permission to honor the part of himself that he has lost
touch with. Lots of laughs, wrestling, and healthy teasing made us feel normal for a few hours.

you hide it and secretly make these moves for something I had earmarked for something else.
We had a plan to move money regularly that we agreed to. I noted several times I do not do that to the BofA account because it would screw you.
Your retort was to show me Safeway grocery charges were mine, and I confirmed they were.
If you somehow think $250 equals the $25k you just moved without so much as a peep you were doing it, we have an issue. The bigger problem is you
are doing this intentionally now with forethought and malice after I asked for a heads-up.
Why are you doing this, given we had an agreed-on solution, and I asked you to work with me instead of doing it secretly? As always, we had a plan to
ensure BofA would be funded. Yet you moved 25k without so much as a peep to me.
This creates yet another huge trust issue. To repeat myself from last week, how would you feel if I moved huge sums of money out of BofA when you
were trying to pay bills? You asked me not to do that, and while I bought groceries, I don't.
Please advise, as the entire discussion is in OFW. I am truly baffled at this intentional deception.

Every day feels like I'm swimming upstream because nothing you say is true or happens.
I'm sure you get why that bothers me after a year of parental alienation with no plan.
Can we try this again? Thanks, in advance for fixing what you did not follow through on.

It is an odd question, right?
For years, we have dined where one person picks up the tab, and the other pays them back. This is actually how all group dinner work instead of
handing over five cards.
You know this to be a fact. Just like you know, our phone bills have a call history. I've run out of ways to explain the obvious to you for the things you
know are true.
You took 26k from us w/o telling me after we agreed you would not. Intentionally deceiving me.
I said I don't need the cash if you're not stealing and would deposit it. Please stop harassing me.

I don’t feel it’s helpful to have the kids grow up in a hateful and resentful family like you and yours. By contrast your mother is a reason we are here.
You and I are very different people. Your purpose in life is to hate, destroy, and rewrite our history and make sure everyone believes your false
narrative.
I’m choosing the truth and a path towards a way that does not make our kids hate a part of themselves. The part that is each of us. You want the
opposite.

The market, in general, is pretty healthy. That said, I do watch and make moves that maximize our gains. I have always done this, and the market has
never beaten me.
While I do not claim to be an expert, I feel like I am super lucky or have enough domain knowledge in the tech sector to make reasonably sound
predictions.
Examples include exiting Tesla, entering Nvida, and selling AMD and MSFT at 52-week highs. You would have been out on those moves and lost
potential gains.
So... if we wanted to consider an approach where I sell something (AMZN or AMD) and we spilt those proceeds now w/o splitting everything, it
might behoove you to consider.
I am not going to die on this hill. I will continue to manage my portfolio and try to do what I have always done. But if you want to slipstream off that,
I am happy to continue.
If you do not understand what I am saying or think I am trying to do something nefarious, I will be doing it to myself as well in this scenario, which I
have no interest in doing.
We may be fighting like cats and dogs right now, but long term I want you to be as successful as we always have been. And I'm rooting for you for you
to do great things.
I don't like you right now, but I still love you and always will. I'm happy to explain or discuss.

Ok... before I say something stupid, I interpreted your ask of me is that we slice the "Moyer" account in half. And we each get 50%. I assume that it
would be used for discretionary spending. The net being is we don't want to pay for each other's Botox or massages.  We would need to agree on that
definition, but we could do that.
So, if that is the case and the lawyers are interpreting your ask correctly, I will proceed. If that is not the case and the lawyer <-> lawyer
communications are not aligned, I am happy to just wait till they figure it out, or you can tell me. But whatever it is, I don't care to argue or fight. I'm

Yes split that joint fidelity account 50/50. All other accounts will be frozen, including fidelity with msft stock, retirement accounts, hsa accounts etc,
so no further stock sales or movement of money out.
The amount we receive now will be factored in once we finalize the final asset split.
The amount we receive will be used by each of us to pay our own expenses moving forward. You pay your rent, upkeep of rental, insurance, food,
clothing, etc. Yes I pay for my Botox, and other personal expenses including home mortgage payment, clothing etc
At final settlement, we will settle up anything that was paid individually that should have been borne by the other party.
Kid related expenses will be split temporarily 50/50. We will need to align what these are like tuition, camp fees, school related expenses etc. my
suggestion is we both deposit an equal agreed upon amount from our split of funds, into the jt BofA bank account, and only use that for kids
expenses. Ie monthly tuition payments due starting July. No personal spend from that account or it will need to be reimbursed.
My income is my separate income, as is any income you may earn, and will be deposited into our separate accounts.
I will stop college contributions for the kids and savings into Vanguard until we can align what are contribution should be.
I believe the cash deposit from your Deferred Comp plan was earned during the marriage, as are your remaining RSUs that are vesting. Those should
be preserved until final asset split. I will treat the vesting Sbux RSUs granted during our marriage the same way. How these are treated will be finalized
in the split.

- I offered to follow your rules and use an agreeable format for issue resolution to chat later. You agreed, and now say no.

You have access to all your spend and it accounts. You removed me from visibility to fidelity account. I can pull out my spend in Amazon account.
So you would have denied Christmas trip? Cabo was blocked for us despite having pre paid room.
What are items to discuss? I asked you to share topics.

Boys summer schedule was shared with you.
Jennifer was informed of Max and Adrian's dates (including Max in Texas and Hong Kong) and expressed no concerns. After yesterday, she said she
will think about her proposal, and will come back with recommendation.
I am asking Kari for dates in July for Adrian. Max has asked to pause for now.
Do you mind sharing a full list of all the therapy that you are proposing both kids skip to accommodate the schedule you are proposing?
I swear to god, Christine. There were so many better ways to have done this. I was so onboard for us and the boys. Also the healthiest I had (and we
had) ever been.
If you had just said- "let's take care of my scar tissue like you have been asking me to do" or even "i'm still gonna leave you, but let's do it peacefully and
in a healthy way"
I will never understand why you had to do it this way. If there was damage before, what is there now?

Please use OFW for communications.
I did not tell Adrian about the schedule and potential conflicts - That is an untrue statement.
I told Adrain there was try outs tonight. He asked if I had paid, I said yes for try outs only.
Stated he did not want to do it.
I asked if you had spoken to him about participating in the league. He said no. I said, I thought he wanted to and had discussed with you. If there was
a miscommunication, to connect with you directly.
Yes - Agree to engage lawyers on this one.
So, AD said you spoke to him and let him know he would be gone for the summer. I think I will take issue with your assertion of 100% parental
control. Please don't go after him again like you did last time because of what he said to me.

And then for vacations, how we handle them. Let's not fight; we know the deal. All our "at cost" stuff was given away (Presidential, Executive, Studio)
or is not usable till Oct. I know I banked Rancho, you canceled Sol Mar. Can we agree on something? If we can't let's not bother. Let's let the lawyers

I won’t talk to you when you pepper the communications with statements with digs and issues you state as facts and are not. I have stated repeatedly I
refuse to defend or refute because that’s how you draw me into a longer conversation and confrontation.
You then accuse me of not working with you.
The finances are a known, the timing and what the amounts we need to pay are. They are due Robert. The mortgage, the tuition. To act any different
is disingenuous.
The spend we have/had was based on two incomes. You have decided not to participate in that anymore. You have since increased your spend. I
broke down the chase card. I am 12.5% of that spend. You will see the breakdown.
The result is you have put me in a situation where I am now reliant on you to sell stock to pay my expenses. This is another way you have decided to
control me.
I have asked to split finances immediately.
The delay is another example of your attempts to control.
The travel authorization. People are waiting for you to return that to either finalize plans or decide if they need to change plans.
We have Cabo as a proxy of what you will do. You refused to return it despite saying you are not saying “no”.

We were so successful, Christine. From stocks to real estate. We did not just 'dumb luck' our way into our money, going all the way back to Cisco 25
years ago. We were thoughtful and planful. Ying to each other Yang. We are good at this.

Today, I get this from the Netflix account I’ve had for 20 years. I can’t get past it. I can’t watch. Last week it was selling 63k secretly, the week before

I worked hard to create and maintain this for the Kids and Family events. You obviously don't allow that anymore. I might have some visibility on
important dates, but only if I catch them in the email and get all the updates.
Examples:
- Lot's of my events are out of date now- like anything school-related
- Some are wrong- like the Dr Kwon visit I showed for that was cancelled
- Some conflict- like I have AD down for Kari and Jennifer at 5:00 Monday
I also have no way to contact you in a timely way if I have a question.
Examples:
- AD is missing basketball because you misunderstood
- AD stranded w/ no phone, no ride, and not at the bus stop
- AD has no ride home while sitting in the Nurse's office
- AD needs to leave basketball at halftime w/ a breakdown
I acknowledge you assert that you are the only parent to our children and act accordingly. But may I request that you reconsider the situation and
help me understand where my kids are and how to communicate until the law catches up to you?

Your lawyer has stated no division of assets unless we agree to your conditions to equalize income and I bear a greater portion of children costs.
I did not see proposal on how to pay bills that are coming due that you have been made aware of.
I don’t see the cash in the other fidelity account, and have no access, so shall assume that is not being used to pay your bills that are due until the

Ok-

If I do it straight from Moyer, I think we might have to cover the margin first and I'd rather do it my way than fight about that.
I am happy to work with you on fine-tuning our monthly move. We can get this dialed in till we divorce. It's not rocket science.

selective adoption of therapy rules is not all what I proposed.
BTW- “Till we get a determination” , I realize you have outsourced your marriage in parenting to a series of lawyers, Susan, James, Annalisa, Natalie,

Got it- Therapy counts as 1-1 visitation time to you.  I disagree but you twist it up as you like.
Then, the next time I see him will be in two weeks. He has expressed concerns to us that I have documented and shared that "Alan" time is not real-
time. So you know that. Given that is the only thing that you are even permitting this summer, is it fair to say that I might not get to have this
conversation mano-mano till there is a parenting plan (Sept?)
Stepping back, you, as a highly educated person, have to be able to see that you have decided unilaterally to be a vigilante parent, unenforceable by
law. You have had 4 lawyers, 6 therapists, and 7 parenting plans. And here we are. You have effectively learned how to "donald trump" family law. It's
unenforceable, just my choice not to be an a-hole about it.
So when can I see my son 1-1 to discuss the trip? That is healthy for him mentally of course.

I’d love if we could have a two way conversation about the mental health of our kids and doing what is right by them for both of us. So can we have a
one topic conversation about our kids? You keep logging on, shooting arrows and logging off immediately. It’s not helpful.
One is leaving the state. The other is coming back to shore and I won’t see him for two weeks at best except maybe therapy. I had zero say in anything
this summer after being the primary caregiver giver last year across three different countries. Sixty six total days w/o you. The same number of days
without incident.
And in the last two weeks:
- You did not allow me even a hello for his birthday
- You didn’t take him basketball so I missed him there
- You threatened legal action for our phone call
- You would not let me drop gifts off at the mailbox
- You will not permit a welcome home hug from me
- And just now, you asserted you have a plan the allows me zero visits apart from the six supervised hours every two weeks. And that is all I get, period.
I reread the communications. You are incorrect. And it speaks to other options to see him in the same mail. Your assertion is patently false. You know
that.
I am asking you again, please don’t block me from my children or my children from me. Just like his birthday, then his gift dropped at the mailbox, his
basketball games, this hug is simple, harmless, but a small gesture that demonstrates I am there for him. No matter what adult business we have going
on. He sees he is number one, not taking a backseat to personal agendas. I know this is healthy for him.
I think it really comes down to the fact that you believe you are the singular parent to our children and  they are better off with only you instead than
having both of us. I don’t know a single expert, who says that. Please reconsider your total blackout. You were not even in the country for 2.5 months
last year and I did great! After no mishaps- I get nothing?
Please reconsider, this is so small and still so big.

Alan, and includes participation in reunification counseling with Jennifer and me. That is it. Nothing more or less. Done.
It is not a comprehensive residential schedule or a complete parenting plan. It does not provide a detailed weekly or monthly schedule, address legal
custody or decision-making authority, or cover holidays, school vacations, and other important aspects of our children's routine.
You know this gets old and I honestly don't care to make you look bad. And even after all the character assassination that you and your family have

And just so I understand before you change the subject again, are you able to grok that we do not have a signed parenting plan? If we can’t agree it will
get frustrating to argue. So let’s put that to bed now, or agree that you will ask Natalie if we have one.

Re chase visa, all our credit is frozen as our as were subject to privacy leaks.
Depending on which credit agency chase uses to check your credit , you will need to call or go to website to unfreeze. The numbers are in their

Watching the documentary on Netflix. It’s interesting of course, but in a weird way to me. All these people who were happy, and did not want to
blow up their home life, their family, all they had worked for. But after ten years, they lost their spark. The bedroom just was not happening anymore.
So they did this.
Crazy. Crazy. It makes me reflect of course. Especially on my pleas for counseling last spring. We were the opposite. We had it all. And bed was
unquestionably the hottest and most incredibly intimate place we could be. After 30 years it could not have been better. Crazy. Crazy. At least we
went out on top there.
And then we blew up everything else that mattered.

I just sent you my photo getting my Vivitrol shot. You knew I could not show signs of drinking. So did you explain that was medically impossible?
I think it will serve everyone well to be able to debunk things that we know could not be medically true. He would likely feel better too.

When our child expressed this belief, did you explain to him that being under the influence is not even possible for me? If a child believes something
negative and frightening that you know to be false and harmful, why not correct this misunderstanding? Why allow such a dangerous and impossible
belief to continue? Did you think that lie was in his best interest to believe?

Thanks. I'm getting very concerned that these misunderstandings are becoming more frequent as Adrian has less time with me. This pattern is

was "mini-me" until you did this.
You have continued to limit contact between us, further creating a space for misconceptions to grow and create unfamiliarity. It's natural for children
to struggle with understanding complex adult situations, but without regular, positive interactions with both parents, these misunderstandings can
solidify into harmful beliefs.
Let's work together to increase my time with Adrian. This would allow him to form his own opinions based on direct experiences rather than
potentially distorted perceptions. Regular, meaningful contact is essential for maintaining a healthy parent-child relationship. Remember you have

stopped every memory of me from him.
For AD's best interests, I would propose:
- Increase my time with Adrian, including more frequent visits and activities. We saw each other daily this time last year
- Consideration of family counseling sessions to help navigate our overall situation. You have never allowed this to happen.
- Involve a family therapist or mediator to create a balanced, positive co-parenting environment. You have refused this.
You are probably not the best messenger as I am your target. He has no safe space as he has to please you for the basic necessities of life. And not
explaining the medical impossibility of what he said seems misguided. This of course, also calls into question past recollections from you and he.
Example: Cabo is your favorite.
Attachment theory explains that a child's emotional and psychological development is deeply influenced by the quality of their bond with their
caregivers. When one parent targets another, this bond is disrupted, making reunification therapy ineffective if it is bookended by the alienating
parent's influence to and from the appointment.
I'm committed to addressing any concerns you or Adrian might have to ensure he has a balanced, healthy relationship with both of us, benefiting his
emotional well-being and our ability to co-parent effectively. Could we discuss a plan to help Adrian with professional support to ensure the best
psychological outcome?

From prior communications, I understood you were not impacting that account, however as noted below and attached, and based on Rocket Money,
your personal bills are still coming out of funds in this jt account.
I saw a Safeway purchase yesterday using your debit card.
As these bills have not yet come out of the account - you can go into the accounts online or call, and update so have these bills paid from your credit
card or out of your personal BofA account.

Hey Christine- I think I just moved 55k to that account a couple weeks back. After you took 63k without telling me over the course of four days. I
have offered all weekend to talk to you about Canada/Hong Kong/Bills. I have asked to set a time to talk so we don't spend a bunch of money on
lawyers going in circles. And you keep coming at me. I'm stepping away. Find fuel elsewhere.

You have not communicated any concerns per request. If you do, please share in OFW email.
Parkers authorization is on hold. Other families are also waiting to finalize plans based on my plans.
If you are asking the only way to execute is to talk or go through lawyers, I’ll reevaluate plans/next steps.

Message 3408 of 4024
A year ago today, our lives changed irrevocably. After months of intense emotional connection, I kissed you and our kids goodbye as you left for
Hong Kong. The same people never returned. The moment you landed, you were bombarded with a stream of hate and vitriol. Our daughter missed
her flight, and somehow, this was all your fault because you got the boys on the plane but not our 31-year-old.
It was as if a long-dormant emotional monster, held inside for the last three decades, was suddenly unleashed. Elsa berated you relentlessly, telling you
over and over what an awful mother you were and how you had ruined her life. It was unbearable, and then you asked me to step in; the abuse was
soul-crushing, and to be honest, you sounded as if you would break. Even as I tried, I could not stem the tide of Elsa, the blame, the hate.
In the following days, you revisited the same spots you frequented when you were pregnant as a teenager, staring at the harbor with the sights and
sounds of Hong Kong in full effect. The vibrant colors of the city, the bustling streets, and the smell of the sea must have triggered a flood of
memories. My heart aches for the emotions you must have felt and the onslaught of painful memories you endured on the heels of the assault.
Then you talked with Lilian, who piled on with stories of me being drunk on a visit before the pandemic. I had embarrassed your family and never
been back to apologize. This was unforgivable, and she let it be known what a coward I was for my absence, not apologizing face-to-face even years
later. I deeply regret this incident and acknowledge that my past actions seriously strained our relationship. For that, I am genuinely sorry.
Our minds, fresh from our own spring of self-created amateur “mushroom therapy” to help ease our own trauma and PTSD scars, were perhaps also
open to triggers we were unaware of. It was the downside of uncontrolled experimentation with neuroplasticity, And we would never be the same. All
the pain, anguish, and deep hurt came out in our next phone call. After all that was happening and a well-deserved reason to blame me, I became the
target.
After the best months of our life as a family and married couple, I was the problem now and had been all along from this point of view. Everything
that had happened and gone wrong since leaving Hong Kong was my fault. Then, after you landed, Max told me that in Hong Kong, you had decided
to divorce me when you all got home. Since then, my life has been rewritten, and others have taken over my marriage and parenting.
The changes have profoundly affected our children in the last year, who left that day as happy and optimistic kids and now see us as lifelong enemies.
My primary concern has always been their well-being, and I am committed to maintaining a healthy relationship with them even as this explodes
around us. I have continued to take steps towards sobriety and reconciliation and worked hard to improve myself as a parent.

I am fully committed to cooperating with professionals, including Connor and Jennifer, to ensure the best possible outcomes for them. I hope for a
positive co-parenting relationship with you, and I am dedicated to providing a stable, nurturing environment for Max and Adrian. My goal is to move
forward constructively, focusing on the well-being of our children and the potential for a harmonious family dynamic and will continue.
I have done so much research and pored over books, presentations, and white papers, all of which I am happy to share with you. But please know that
It is very possible that the intense emotional experiences and unresolved past traumas, combined with mushrooms, triggered a mental regression in us.
Psychedelic substances sometimes unlock deep-seated memories, bringing them to the surface in unexpected and overwhelming ways.
The sudden flood of painful memories and unresolved trauma, especially those tied to your formative years in Hong Kong, could have caused an
intense psychological reaction that may have led to a well-deserved sense of anger and overdue blame towards me that had been simmering for years. It
was what we talked about fixing before you left. Understanding this does not excuse any harm I have done, but it might help explain the instant
change.
Our passion burns white-hot on both sides of the coin. There is no in-between with us. We went from being the two most seemingly in love people
the world had ever seen to mortal enemies. So for one moment, just a moment, please, after 30 years together, fighting like cats and dogs and
snuggling toes and making love, consider the fact that perhaps we flew too close to the sun and our wings melted. But let's remember who we were,
acknowledge who we've become, and see if we can forge a new path of understanding. But we don’t have to hate each other.
It's been a long year. May we please consider a change?

I asked Adrian how he knew the details of your Bellevue home, including rent, as you implied I told him. I have been very careful not to discuss this.
He indicated that he saw this on your computer screen at the Old Bellevue place, says he saw the rent of 7,767 or something like that.
Given that this information came from you, I trust you will correct the record for anyone you have shared that I gave him this information.

me might result in an interrogation for mom. Like the California thing I thought we cleared up.
Let’s don’t blow it out or proportion though. It’s a thing we can work on. Not a big deal.
And today was a win! Neither of us got what we wanted but we did not yell or hang up on each other. We both communicated some outstanding
concerns without loosing it. You also let me apologize for past comments and name calling. To me that’s a start!
If we can keep it up we might make progress! Let’s decide if we can make some more quick decisions that make us both equally unhappy...

Is there a way we can work on communicating better? We could have spent the morning together instead of him playing video games. Frankly, he has
no idea what's happening, so I assume it is not a big deal.
Plus, it can't be a tradition. The 4th of July was the biggest holiday of our year. Our tradition. The boys and I had everything planned, and the beach
camp was prepped early, ready to pamper MOM. It was our family's big day!
I guess I am just super hurt. You take every holiday, every break, everything. Even the things that were solely focused on us just chilling as a happy and
healthy family together and being thankful for each other. I have all the pics!
I feel like I'm dead to the family, and it's not right, especially after your secret 4th last year.

You never do fireworks. You never even do the 4th. You’re from Hong Kong. This day is just always me trying to make us happy as a family, having us

I have hundreds of these pictures, all taken on the 4th of July. It is us, like it or not. I know you took every picture from AD's past and removed all
childhood memories from our house, but this is who we were as a family. So I'd love to see him for the fireworks tonight to remember.
Of course, I also understand today is your "Independence Day" with Kevin, but tbh, he doesn't even know AD apart from the few times you made
them eat together. So, I'd appreciate it if we could continue our Moyer family traditions and let you and Kevin just create your own.

It is always tough to talk to them when you have the kids. I think we saw that yesterday. Ideally, you would suggest some convenient windows to chat
and even note some of your activities that I could ask them about so they know we are on the same "parent team."
It is incredibly awkward for us to talk while they are on vacation and not be able to say, "Tell me about your day" without them feeling like they are
being a spy by saying anything about their vacation or I am spying on them to try and figure out what's up.
If we can't find a good way to keep me current and in the loop with the kids, given all that you have arranged away from me overseas in July, it's going
to be a super long month and really unhealthy. I'll need you to help overcome the barriers put up.
- Nov-Feb: Saw AD about five times a week
- March-June: Saw AD about three times a week
- June-Today: See AD once every two weeks
- July: I'll see AD twice this month after 66 days solo last summer
The longer I demonstrate my sobriety, the less I see my kids. So please help me stay in touch while you jet-set around the world, taking every single
holiday they had since last year. Especially back to where they said, "Mom said we are divorcing you in Hong Kong."
Your help will be much appreciated as you have taken sole custody and left the country.

I’ve obviously powered through our homework books from Jennifer. I’m sure she feels like these are important for us to read and understand so we
can be better parents raising Max and AD.
But the last two books are only available in hard copy and on Kindle. So I read them and I am realizing that will be a challenge for you given the
limited cycles you have and our history trying to find time.
So I figured out a way to “de-drm” the books, convert to PDF, and then use an accessibility app to read the book aloud as if you were on Spotify. It’s
not as good as Audible but it’s a still way easier.
It’s all paid for if we use the family sharing we agreed on to save money. So I’d like to set you up. Then at least you can listen on the way to and from
work. I can make this brain dead simple for you.
Please let me do what I have always done for us, and give you a little edge or leg up to be more successful. The sooner we operate from a place of
common understanding the better the kids will be.
Please let me know... it will take 10 minutes max and save you days trying to find time between meeting to sit and take notes with a hard copy. And
you can always go back and do that if you need.
I hope you’ll let me, help you, help us, help the kids.

You are welcome.
Please consider the request I sent for time and opportunity with the kids. It is based on professional guidance from Dr. Brown, a well-respected Co-
Parenting counselor I see, and consistent with the books Jennifer has asked us to read. It is the healthy thing to do.
I'd also appreciate your partnership getting us all together with Jennifer ASAP, before HK for sure. I don't think there is an argument, so please let me
know if you disagree. I honestly hope we start with an intervention since Kari refused, but we will let Jennifer decide of course.
So, I'd like us to agree that we will both move heaven and earth for our boys. It starts with making sure that the people and processes we have agreed to
adopt and follow happen promptly—i.e., Jennifer's plan. Running out the clock does not make sense for anyone.

I’m going to suggest that you stop it before we spiral down another rabbit hole .
May we please discuss my time with the kids?

The best practices were what we paid Dr. Brown for. Not you picking email rules and ignoring the actual therapist part of the engagement noted
below.
Best practices are actually in the two books that Jennifer asked you to read. Should we agree that we will start following those now? I’m game.
Message 3490 of 4024
I have taken it up with Lisa, and she has sent emails to Natalie. Those have been ignored last week.
Now you know that they have been ignored, is it still your advice for me to go through legal channels?
Divorce and child custody is a $28 billion business. I’m asking to do something helpful for Max and Adrian not pay for college and vacations for
someone else.
You outsourced parenting to lawyers. I’m going to hold firm that they may be well intentioned but unqualified to be my kids decision makers.
Can we discuss seeing the kids this week. They have no plans. I was 100% in charge this time last year and am only more sober and more responsible.

I am happy to chat after 5:30. Just let me know when.
If you have responded, you made my point. Our conversation and the mental health outcome of our kids is sitting somewhere in an email folder
between the three degrees of separation established in the $28 billion parenting model that’s been chosen. (that number is 5-years old btw)
This time last year I was floating down the lazy river and lining up for adventures in Leavenworth with both our kids, their friends, and Katherine’s
family. I was an amazing dad then and have only improved. There is no legal reason for me to be blocked right now so we should discuss how I can
parent our kids.
I will not be #erased.

Here is what I had asked of you that I wanted to reach an agreement on as well for the kids:
"’l'll just wait till everyone is home before reaching out.
Are there things I can ask about that you all did so we can have a natural conversation and it not feel like “spying.”
I want him to feel at ease and see we are aligned when it comes to him. We don’t keep secrets and this is normal."
Please let me know so I can engage in a way that he feels comfortable. AD has not picked up in five days, and that gives me pause with your travel
plans and our inability to work together on healthy solutions. You did not even answer this.
I'll also ask that you give Max his gifts that I have sent to the house. It is important that the kids know that even while you have declared all our war on
me and removed every single reference to me in their lives, that I still think of them.
If this is going to be like my meds or UAs, and you are just going to refuse to give him my gifts, please let me know. I'll obviously have to make it a
legal issue, but I REALLY do not want to do that for something as simple and reasonable as this.

Your position is there is no reason the kids do not have time with you.
There is no reflection or acknowledgement of the cumulative and long lasting impact your actions over the decades have had on all of us.
To attack the family that provided support and protection to kids and I, and to yourself over decades is telling.
To state it is all heresay is also telling. Why even look from that viewpoint unless you intend to deny all the incidents or take the position that everyone
is lying.
You did everything that was been outlined. Every one of them.
Your position is either we are all lying or yes you did it, but ignore the impact.
Ultimately we all know the truth.
If you are able to convince Connor or others,  what has been described were lies made up by me, kids, family and friend’s, that will be informative as
well. Everyone who has been impacted will have their own perspective and view of that outcome, but facts don’t change.

So, I'd like us to agree that we will both move heaven and earth for our boys. It starts with making sure that the people and processes we have agreed to
adopt and follow happen promptly—i.e., Jennifer's plan. Running out the clock does not make sense for anyone. "

The ball is literally in your court so can we chat about how to make this happen? We need to resolve this much more quickly than OFW permits. So

Cabo was remaining issue as noted last week in your response. Rosen could have been cancelled last week but for whatever reason your side made

In my POV that is strange and expensive to hold Rosen for this one issue but strategy you decided to take.
The money in attorney fees generated by Cabo discussion is an interesting choice on your side but it is your choice and spend.

You are continuing to make the decision to have lawyers manage this issue. If it’s solved then that’s all you needed to tell them but you have not.
Again you sent this through your lawyer over the holiday break, then they left town.
What was expectation on your side for reviewing and managing a response? I did not see in your letter, I’m sending this over the holiday weekend,
but because I will be away when you respond, please have Christine respond directly with Robert.
How was Lisa supposed to cancel Rosen if she’s gone?
It appears your strategy was never to cancel Rosen as that would have been impossible given Lisa is out and could not review any response after the
holidays.

I know those rub you the wrong way and how hard it is just to get one to them, but I sent it through Alan so hoped that would be ok. Mind letting
Max have it? It’s stupid, cheap, but maybe funny. And it lets him know I still think about him no matter what.
That is one of the things parents who are targeted to be erased are advised to do. Like my volunteer stuff and attendance at everything he does. At
some point he will look back and know that the man who he is named after, loved him unconditionally.
He might even realize that if everyone got to just kick people out of their family when they were unhappy with them, there would not be any families
at all.

Everything condition you set, makes it worse. Always. You are never comfortable. You always make it worse. I can’t think of a single time when you

When I see you insisting that we do the one thing that has made this intolerable and intractable that lets me know that you are in no mood to
cooperate and you are only gonna continue to escalate things.
This has gone on for months now. We have tons of emails with me asking for this. If you have a change of heart and actually want to work with me

Message 3560 of 4024
Christine-
Adrian met with Kari yesterday, and we received an excellent report card. During their conversation, they decided I would attend the next
appointment to address some things on Adrian's mind. This is a significant breakthrough, as it's the first time he has agreed to have me join his session
in all the months he has been going.
I am excited about this opportunity, especially considering our near-total estrangement and the upcoming trip to Hong Kong, where all of these
issues began after Elsa and your Mother's advice. The timing is perfect for a breakthrough, especially given the professional advice that there might be
better ideas than the Hong Kong trip. 
I wanted to let you know that I was looking forward to a professionally facilitated discussion. However, you intervened and stopped it. You listed
many reasons against it and stated that Adrian voted against attendance because that would mean two full hours in a single week and you two felt like
that was too much to invest.
My Concerns:
- I think you should have talked with me instead of letting Adrian vote on therapy without discussing it.
- As the targeting parent, your influence in this discussion with him may affect his decision to talk to me.
- You are making 100% of the mental health decisions for our family without any legal authority to do so.
- This is not what the books Jennifer recommended say to do. We need to heed the advice we were given.
Reflection:
During my first reunification meeting, you told Adrian that I had not blown, implying I was under the influence, which is medically impossible as I
am on Vivitrol. Despite knowing this, you and Natalie demanded I take two 12-panel tests.
This is akin to giving Max a pregnancy test after a date – unnecessary and misleading. This demonstrates either a total lack of understanding of my
sobriety program (big issue) or nefarious intentions. (bigger issue.) by you two.
Either way, your actions misled Adrian, and you both used him as a pawn, especially troubling given Kari's concern that he was considering self-harm
because he was caught in the middle when we started with her. He thinks this was him.
Recap:
- First reunification session: Adrian was misled and used as a pawn.
- First requested Father/Son session: You unilaterally canceled it.
Moving forward, I hope that any decisions regarding our children's mental health (or any other significant decisions) will involve me.
Additionally, I ask that we collectively make an effort to:
- Start being honest with Adrian
- Stop defaming me as his father
- Avoid using Adrian as your pawn
I remain optimistic because you were always a great mom before July. Even in December, when we had the Phase I parenting plan, things were good,
and we worked well together.
ASK:
- Stop interfering with the mental health engagements run by professionals

It is documented we have tried for days to ask about Rosen. The documented was agreed except for Cabo.
Your choice.
I will see what time your lawyer responded.
As you noted I was behind and decision was already made which you refused to tell me.

You stated you responded already and I was behind.
Our side has asked if this is the only issue but your side has repeatedly refused to put this to bed and reschedule Rosen.
Ball is in your court.
If you did not want to go to Rosen for this issue, why wasn’t he cancelled last week?
That was only issue remaining last week? We have repeatedly asked this question.
The delay and refusal to cancel had been on your side.
Your side is either intentionally avoiding this topic, or secretly planning to do Rosen and not being forthcoming.
Either way your side must know financial impact of delaying the decision to cancel or reschedule this late.

You should have everything you asked for. Everything. I did not push back on a single demand. Nothing. You refused when I tried to work with you
to honor your commitments, even after giving away or canceling 140-person nights at a five-star resort that I could have used. You went above and
beyond to screw me, cancel me and give away community property.
You did not compromise or work together on a single item—nothing. Even though you have a full salary and our cheaper home mortgage because of
my decisions to purchase and refinance, And, you actually stalled both of those things. Although you never had an issue with the cost disparity when I
was in the dump in West Seattle, you just won't allow equity in our lives.
Of course that's the money. You have stolen 99.9% of our kids.  I'll focus on that theft now.

Have you read the correspondence?  I asked to solve this with you for days now. You would not.
You insisted on everything going through Natalie while on vacation. That is well documented.

The original language for Cabo was drafted by your lawyer, approved by you and sent to us on July 1st. This was your original proposal. We did not
write this language, it came from you.
We approved the Cabo language drafted and approved by you on July 3. Cabo was not an issue.
All issues were agreed middle of last week July 3rd.
We asked to reschedule Rosen on July 3rd.
Your lawyer sent back revised language for Cabo on Friday July 5. Your lawyer was aware everyone was out for the holiday weekend. She had receipt
of out of office replies stating as such with return on Monday. This was only issue remaining but there was no indication to cancel Rosen on your
side, as we requested. You continued to reserve right to have Rosen decide this issue.
We responded Monday July 8 am, once everyone was back in the office. Again we asked to reschedule Rosen if this was one remaining issue. Your side
did not agree to do so.
This has cost you thousands.

For Adrian, I noted your email communication in regards to his telephone call.
I’m not comfortable sharing my thoughts with you as it does not feel safe for me.
Either way, our interpretation is just that, our POV.
As Adrian is speaking with both Kari and Jennifer, they are in a good position to determine his perspectives, separate from how you or I may view or
communicate a situation.
On a positive note, we have witnessed Adrian become increasingly more comfortable verbalizing how he feels, and addressing a situation
independently. I have noticed a marked change this year in his communication style and confidence. I am very proud of him.

I have shared that OFW and other forms of communications with you have become an unsafe space for me where I feel attacked and threatened,
causing great anxiety and fear. It is real for me.
Example: I received in one day, two very direct OFWs, one attaching an article that discusses an ex boyfriend killing his ex girlfriend at her work place,
stating how the recommended targeting was scary personal for you, and another “expressing concern” for my well being.
This is causing me great distress, they are alarming, I feel unsafe, threatened, anxious, and scared.
Below feels like another attempt to bully and shame me, disregarding my multiple communications to you, since you sent those specific ones
referenced, on the direct impact what you have sent has had to me. This is scary to me. I cry when I think about it and hyperventilate. I feel attacked.
I have on multiple occasions expressed your communications feel unsafe and bullying and abusive and am doing so again.

Msft fidelity account - Per agreement - there should be no cash payments, money movements or stock sales. Please confirm.
Jt Bank of America - There is still some of your personal spend from that account which should just be for kids, if you can deposit back in. Please

Thank you for the message. I agree a more friendly tone is much needed. I appreciate the outreach. I am glad you had a good trip to Bali.
Max arrived home yesterday. It was a bit of a journey to get him home, but a learning experience for him.
I saw your moms message for a visit. I sent some dates, Oct 5/6 work well for me. She said she is getting your feedback.
... are all out of town this weekend. Any chance you and I can take a deep breath and try to smoke the peace pipe? I would love to sit down and talk a
little about how we get those two crazy people we have seen over the last year to be kind to each other again.
It’s the one thing we have not tried... but when we used to do it, the risk/reward curve was always in our favor. I solemnly swear not to talk visitation
at all. Hell we don’t even need to talk “running list” at all. We can just find a way to be peaceful and graceful to each other, in a public place.
Wouldn’t it be a Christmas miracle if the kids came back to town and mom and dad (both equal parts of their whole) could actually communicate
and put them first. I honestly believe at some point the courts will ask us to do it anyway, so let’s just impress the hell out of them and beat them to

It’s so much more than tone. “I’m not ready for that” has only really translated to “I’m ready to continue to have things get even worse”

In this OFW was an attachment that showed amounts from your personal bills that are still impacting BofA.
I have sent my lawyer a list of some spend that has come out of the account since July 12 - over 2K.
If you can go in and transfer back into that account from your personal funds, that would be great, and then set up your accounts to draw from your
personal accounts too.
We will both need to transfer amounts in to cover Aug tuition bills, and make sure balance does not drop below 10K.
I sent you OFW detailing where I have been tracking Kids expenses in an excel, that has been shared with you, with receipts, that I bill to Jt Account.
I also sent OFW for Seahawks spreadsheet so we can start dividing the tickets.
For both shared accounts, can you confirm you can access them?

Fo the call, I think you did, as I was on the phone with her briefly and she said you were calling her back? If this does not match your records, can you
reach out to her?
The discussion was about trying to get the big group together, that she ultimately decided to hold on.

Open to other ideas for tracking and managing the expenses we are splitting per the temporary agreement.
I had also shared with you a listing of your personal expenses that are still hitting the Jt account, which is drawing down funds to be used for the kids.
Please transfer those funds back in. We are also about to fall below the 10K threshold and will need to top up to pay for upcoming tuition and other
kids expenses.
Fidelity - I initiated a transfer of half the stock in the jt Fidelity account to my own Fidelity account per the agreement. I confirmed with Fidelity all
the stockholdings were purchased in one lot, so all have the same cost basis. I left the remaining cash balance which we will also split 50/50.

It has to be replaced now.
In April I called them as it was not functioning properly. At that time they could get it back on the rails, but it is so old (17 years) you could see it
degrading and they indicated it would just keep doing it. It was a temp fix. I got a quote then.
Max bumped the garage door on Monday with the car. He has started driving. That was enough to push it completely off. I forgot he had done it and
hit my button and made it worse.
I have them coming out on Sunday to look and give another quote.
We have used them each time, including the condo. If you want to recommend another service feel free.

Subject: Moyer - Can we agree on a temporary parenting plan
Dear Lisa
I think both parties and the boys should have a preliminary session before we start talking about changing the temporary plan we have in place. I did
hear that Robert wanted this weekend again with Adrian, and I agreed to another weekend visit this weekend.
I understand at the last visitation they played ping pong and they had lunch. I would like your client to consider a more constructive activity with
Adrian that would be a little more meaningful towards building a relationship. I think they might spend some time brainstorming with the supervisor
ideas and then there could be enthusiasm built around doing more fun activities.
You may know I have 6 boys (now adults) and 11 grandchildren, and they always wanted to do something and with nice weather that could be a
sports game, an exhibition, a fair, go on a hike, etc and on rain days a science museum, a home depot project event, Dave and Busters- you get the idea.
There is so much to do around here I urge your client to build fun time and activities with Adrian as well as just doing lunch and a game of ping pong.

Please ask:
- What might have caused this AFib episode, and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?
- What kind of follow-up or monitoring should we do to keep an eye on his heart health?
- Is there anything long-term we should be concerned about, or could this be a sign of something else?
Beyond my family history, if you remember this time last year I was solving his cardio problem. I think that was a total of five appointments in three
weeks? I also track everything with his medication and ADHD treatment. I hope you will involve me next time. I know more about Max and his

I just learned you are recording our conversations without consent. That is illegal in the state of Washington.
Cash balance in the Jt Fidelity account was $7,348 that you took as yours and applied to the margin position. Apple just put a 400 cash dividend in
there.
Court Order says no margin activity in the Jt Fidelity account.
Court order says only children's expenses from Bank of America account. Your personal expenses have removed over 5K which has dropped the
balance below the 10K court ordered amount. To date I have not seen this replenished.
Your lawyer asked for my credit card balances as of June 12, by end of week, but has refused to share your balances. This should be excluding legal
fees.
There should have been no withdrawals of cash or sales from other Fidelity account that you have denied me access to.

I realize you did not sign in blood. But agreeing today and giving it serious thought is in itself still a commitment of great magnitude.
The fact that it happened after the week we had, in a sunny parking lot with church hymns singing in the background, was a sign of divinity.
My commitment to start the week:
- No flames  for any reason
- Write up and share Kari notes
- Write up and share Alan notes
- Tackle your Excel todo list
- Find and start DV classes
- Attend meeting with Jennifer
- Go to ADs hoops tryout
I’m sure there are more, but if you see something missing please just let me know. I assure you I will tackle it with speed and cooperation.
If we can even commit to giving each other a chance before handing it over to the lawyers, that alone is a huge victory for our kids & family.
Kids first! You and I, a close second

Fidelity:
I think I can explain all of this, but if you did not get your half of the $400 Apple dividend, and I have the calc correct for the margin purchase, I
would owe you $3,874 to settle Fidelity.
BofA:
I think I stopped all auto-pays
- ATT
- Comcast
- Business Solver
- Power Bill
Then, I deposited $5,375 into the shared account that I think I owed back to the boys.
If that is not correct, please just let  me know and we can talk through any concerns. Between us please.
The next thing we need to tackle is how we get liquid in the Moyer accounts. And formally split them in terms of access and ownership.
It’s weird though, right? We will do this for us mentally and functionally, but we will still be viewed as a married couple when we file?

Having your contact for emergencies is not helpful. You are saying you are off the grid and out of contact. I actually don’t understand any of what
you said below. Having the kids info does not make sense. That is who the emergency would be with. And I have zero idea how I get in touch with
the person that is responsible for my children. This, one week out of an emergency room visit for an unexpected emergency room visit for a very
unusual heart condition.
All I see is you are unavailable, she has the kids contact info, and I have no way to contact her.

I have the info and am fine.Thanks for that.
None of your explanation makes sense. And the fact that you have health info from the cardiologist that you have not shared is disappointing.
You still have not given me any way to contact the person who left AD in a confusing state yesterday and wandering the parking lot, late for pick up.

Info from cardiologist was shared that night and day after. Nothing has changed. I had a conversation with a cardiologist specialist in this area who is a

Thoughts for future discussion:
I’d like to see the ER visit notes and follow up instructions, please. Not sure I can track all the modalities of communication that night z
I don’t know Stephanie who lives 5 Minutes away. Or her daughter who is in charge of my kids. I just know what I saw yesterday was concerning.
We are on day two of having this person I didn’t even know existed, be in charge of my children. I assume it’s all good. I honestly trust you vetted her.
But yesterday you saw we crossed wires on both the drop off and then the pick up. Adrian kept asking to call her so we could figure out where she
was.

Not really a big deal, he is just an anxious kid. But I’ve asked multiple times for contact info. You have refused to provide that for my kids caretaker.
Maybe this is a good test to resolve something peacefully between us, we clearly disagree on. Im committed to turning the page as discussed.
Have a blast, stay dry and we will talk on return.
Message 3810 of 4024
So... since you are not going to provide contact info, my ask is that AD goes to bed at a decent hour. He is always exhausted when he gets here and it
takes a while to warm up.
This may be even worse tomorrow if he has the freedom to stay up extra late playing Xbox because he has a sitter. I like him to be rested and ready for
the home visit Sat.
I hope you can understand why that is important.

We talked about this with Jennifer. I don’t want to spend half our time doing thumbs up or down.
Not an issue for now but let’s reach a friendly agreement on caretaking for our children. And help me understand why it is so important to keep her
contact info a secret from me. It just gives an odd appearance, right? Especially after yesterday.
I’d really like to get off OFW. It’s not good for our attempts to repair and get into divorce therapy.

I have been incredibly respectful and restrained. Even when we were having our disagreements I did not bother you. At all.
I was very intentional while we are deciding if we start divorce therapy under Jennifer’s guidance for the kids. That was our deal.
I trusted you all week and we were a team. At least I was, even when you went dark (and I still didn’t bother you.) about it.
Why would you go in and block me as we try to turn the page to be nicer? What signal did you mean to send by doing that?
You had to take the time, knowing I am doing my best on every item on your todo list, and intentionally block me.
Why would you do that secretly? So now it’s back to the attorneys? We talked about all this. I thought I had your word.

We were able to do the visit. Seemed to go fine. Alan had car trouble so he was late but still just before Conner. AD seemed a bit anxious about the
delay so it would have been nice to tell whoever is in charge of him that things were delayed but no need to worry.

Welcome back...
I hope it’s fair to ask the status of our kids supervision at this point since you are back on the grid. I feel like I was exceptionally patient given the
circumstances. And when you have a moment I’d love to know why it was essential to keep it all a big secret from me.
I’ll add that the one time I was able to reach the kids, it was a one minute phone call with AD. I asked about the sitter to be sure he had her number.
He got weird and immediately asked to get off the phone without answering. He said he would call back and never did.
I’d prefer to have a reasonable dialogue rather than test the expectations of the legal system at great monetary expense and further strain an already
toxic and counterproductive relationship. A week ago we agreed to strongly consider divorce counseling.
Thank you

I remember your ask. Nothing is more important to our children's welfare than creating a safe environment, so I created and executed everything on
my "todo" list to demonstrate my intent. That is not meant to be an escalation. It's an effort to find peace with you.
- No flames  for any reason
- Write up and share Kari notes
- Write up and share Alan notes
- Tackle your Excel todo list
- Find and start DV classes
- Attend meeting with Jennifer
- Go to ADs hoops tryout
I agree to keep the tone friendly, but I also hope to move the ball forward for the kid's sake. May we consider meeting with Jennifer at least to discuss

Hey-
This is not an escalation. As we discussed, it is a simple request to address outstanding issues without including the attorneys. But I don’t know what
you are expecting if you are not responsive. Please help me figure out how.
- On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's
been fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?
- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.
I have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.
- On 8/17, after asking several times about our Seahawks tickets, I tried to make some progress. Obviously, AD's decision to honor his wishes matter
