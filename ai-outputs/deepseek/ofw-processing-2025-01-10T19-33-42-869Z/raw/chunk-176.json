Go through lawyers.\nMessage 3665 of 4024\nWhy won’t you answer the question if you talked to him about the visit or not? That is a simple yes or no question you won’t answear. There is no\nPOV to that. You did or you did not. Why do I have to ask multiple times? Why do you make it impossible to coparent?\nSent:07/16/2024 at 10:07 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/17/2024 at 05:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW/Adrian\nMessage 3666 of 4024\nTyring to bring the temperature down and hoping to work with you.\nAll none child related issues need to go through lawyers as outlined in OFW.\n<<Please share this agreed-upon outline you are talking about. I am unaware of OFW as the rulebook and recall we had discussed Rosen and\nmediation at great length last week so this feels new and made up. Even yesterday, we spent a great deal of time in a two-way discussion about selling\nAMD to which you agreed. >>\nI do not take your threats of unilateral decisions lightly.\n<<Of course this is thick with irony. After unilaterally taking everything in my life, I'll defer comments that may escalate things. I am not making\ndecisions unilaterally. You are refusing to give me my mail, the things you asked to have identified from the garage or make progress on the legal\nagreement, which I have offered to share a plan on several times. Of course, you said to detail here in OFW several times, but today you say above, I\nam not allowed to share here. We are dead in the water with contradictions and obstructions>>\nHK. I have repeatedly asked you to share your proposed plans.\n<<You have my plans. I sent them weeks ago through the lawyers. Please ask Natalie if she has not shared them with you. They came through the\nlawyers, as you requested. Please respond accordingly rather than continue to stall. This has been going on for weeks now.>>\nSeeing kids before hk. No change to our agreement. Adrian had his supervised visit.\n<<This feels like a unilateral decision I should not take lightly>>\nFriday decision. Details need to go through lawyers. I need money too. No unilateral decisions on how much money you take from stock sale. I do not\nagree.\n<<We already funded 35k for July you have been spending. None of this went through lawyers. You get 100% of your paycheck. You have money>>\nAll other issues. Go through lawyers.\n<<When did you make this unilateral decision, today?>>\nSent:07/16/2024 at 10:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/17/2024 at 05:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about",
