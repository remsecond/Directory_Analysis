So we get along better in the future, please help me by answering the question.\nYou knew I had plans today and ignored this till he is on his way, telling me what his new plans are. This is simply not helpful.\nNow my full day has changed.\nI do want to work with you.\nSent:08/17/2024 at 09:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/17/2024 at 09:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian basketball",
