It's the same thing, even the same number of steps.\nWe do so many things that make our life and ability to work together intentionally impossible that it does not make sense. Plus we have agreed to the\ncommon sense changes on at least ~5 occasions in the past.\nMessage 3042 of 4024\nIt’s just your jam to not reply to anything I suggest to help be more constructive.\nInstead it seems like you prefer to just fuel the fire by not even bothering to respond.\nI can’t imagine what it’s like in your head with so much hate and drive to destroy me.\nI wish you nothing but the best if for no other reason than limiting collateral damage.\nSent:06/06/2024 at 05:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/06/2024 at 07:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3043 of 4024\nI wish you well too.\nSent:06/06/2024 at 07:32 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/06/2024 at 07:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3044 of 4024\nSo I was not permitted to see AD even for a moment on his B-Day, even under any rules you wanted.\nYou have asked me to have a make up B-Day visit scheduled for what will be my Father’s Day.\nI’ll assume you don’t believe I get those anymore but I think a parenting plan may say otherwise.\nAs my co-parent I hope you investigate if what you are doing is healthy for them long term.\nI’d like to at least drop off his gift tomorrow. I think that is the very least you should permit.\nPlease advise.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 10:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 03:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
