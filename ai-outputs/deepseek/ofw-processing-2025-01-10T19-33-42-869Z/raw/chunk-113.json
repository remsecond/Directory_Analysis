  "text": "special.\nI don’t get why you took this day too. Especially after last year. Can you give me anything at all?\nMessage 3442 of 4024\nI have hundreds of these pictures, all taken on the 4th of July. It is us, like it or not. I know you took every picture from AD's past and removed all\nchildhood memories from our house, but this is who we were as a family. So I'd love to see him for the fireworks tonight to remember.\nOf course, I also understand today is your \"Independence Day\" with Kevin, but tbh, he doesn't even know AD apart from the few times you made\nthem eat together. So, I'd appreciate it if we could continue our Moyer family traditions and let you and Kevin just create your own.\nPlease let me know.\nSent:07/04/2024 at 06:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 07:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nAttachments:July_4th.jpg (432 KB)\nMessage 3443 of 4024\nWe have plans.

I’ve been doing this with him for twelve years. You and Kevin are one year old and he has no association with you two or\nwhoever else you are adding to his life tonight.\nMay we please chat? This is important to me as a Dad\nSent:07/04/2024 at 07:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 09:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th",
