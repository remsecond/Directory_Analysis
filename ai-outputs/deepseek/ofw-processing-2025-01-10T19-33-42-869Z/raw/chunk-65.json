We are equally frustrated\nand I wish we had help.\nBut you have some important things below that I’m happy to touch base on. We can knock that out if it’s not a “lawyer advice” thing. And even then\nwe can just agree and move on.\nDoes not need to be today, just let me know!\nThanks!\nSent:06/20/2024 at 08:20 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 08:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Tuition/expenses\nMessage 3274 of 4024\nAcknowledge I saw this.
