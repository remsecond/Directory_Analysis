Just walk to the mailbox. It’s not even near the house. I’ll let you know when I’m there. I can come now.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 07:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 08:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3065 of 4024\nOk... told him I couldn’t make it tonight and asked if we could just do it Sunday instead m. I apologized and said it was my fault.\nPlease don’t throw me under the bus, I’m taking the fall so he is not in the middle. I’d never say a bad word about you to him.\nHope you will support my message if he asks. Looking forward to Sunday. I’m really hoping it can be as peaceful as last week!\nHave an awesome night!!\nSent:06/07/2024 at 07:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 08:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3066 of 4024\nAre you going to turn these on so we can do this better!\nSent:06/07/2024 at 09:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 06:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\nMessage 3067 of 4024\nIs everything ok?\nI see you have neither done as you promised for calls nor checked for over twenty hours.\nSent:06/08/2024 at 04:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 06:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications",
