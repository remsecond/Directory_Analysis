We’ve done\nthat in the past very successfully. Something that appears to be a big deal may not be a big deal after all.\nMay I offer this suggestion that will be harmless :\nCan we please ask to make one appointment with Dr. Brown that at least tries to help us get back on reasonable and civil terms together. If it doesn’t\nwork, fine, but let’s please at least try it given she knows us.\nSent:06/20/2024 at 05:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/20/2024 at 05:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Another Escalation\nMessage 3298 of 4024\nChristine, you said you gave away my stuff or at best community stuff that you did unilaterally I didn’t raise my voice.
