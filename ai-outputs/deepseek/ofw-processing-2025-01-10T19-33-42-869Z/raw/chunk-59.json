  "text": "I worked hard to create and maintain this for the Kids and Family events. You obviously don't allow that anymore. I might have some visibility on\nimportant dates, but only if I catch them in the email and get all the updates.\nExamples:\n• Lot's of my events are out of date now- like anything school-related\n• Some are wrong- like the Dr Kwon visit I showed for that was cancelled\n• Some conflict- like I have AD down for Kari and Jennifer at 5:00 Monday\nI also have no way to contact you in a timely way if I have a question.\nExamples:\n• AD is missing basketball because you misunderstood\n• AD stranded w/ no phone, no ride, and not at the bus stop\n• AD has no ride home while sitting in the Nurse's office\n• AD needs to leave basketball at halftime w/ a breakdown\nI acknowledge you assert that you are the only parent to our children and act accordingly. But may I request that you reconsider the situation and\nhelp me understand where my kids are and how to communicate until the law catches up to you?\nJust let me know!\nMessage 3250 of 4024\nThis can be added to list for discussion in split.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:10 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Available Miles\nMessage 3251 of 4024\nYour lawyer has sent a communication regarding assets, income and expenses and your position on those items. I will be reviewing with my lawyer\nand will respond in that forum.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Netflix\nMessage 3252 of 4024\nSo no?\nIf I have to act at retail prices before, I assume the fact that you’re hiding assets and the financial impact will be accounted for.\nAll I am asking is how I use frequent flyer miles like we have always done.\nSent:06/19/2024 at 03:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/19/2024 at 03:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Available Miles",
