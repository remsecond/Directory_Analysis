I can pull out my spend in Amazon account.\nSo you would have denied Christmas trip? Cabo was blocked for us despite having pre paid room.\nWhat are items to discuss? I asked you to share topics.\nAsking to be civil than not acting that way yourself, I can show you documents too.\nSent:06/14/2024 at 08:16 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Can you give me a ring?\nMessage 3174 of 4024\nI’m done playing games\nSent:06/14/2024 at 08:21 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 02:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can you give me a ring?\nMessage 3175 of 4024\nBoys summer schedule was shared with you.\nJennifer was informed of Max and Adrian's dates (including Max in Texas and Hong Kong) and expressed no concerns. After yesterday, she said she\nwill think about her proposal, and will come back with recommendation.\nI am asking Kari for dates in July for Adrian. Max has asked to pause for now.\nDo you mind sharing a full list of all the therapy that you are proposing both kids skip to accommodate the schedule you are proposing?\nI swear to god, Christine. There were so many better ways to have done this. I was so onboard for us and the boys. Also the healthiest I had (and we\nhad) ever been.\nIf you had just said- \"let's take care of my scar tissue like you have been asking me to do\" or even \"i'm still gonna leave you, but let's do it peacefully and\nin a healthy way\"\nI will never understand why you had to do it this way. If there was damage before, what is there now?\nSent:06/14/2024 at 02:48 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 04:05 PM)\nSubject:summer schedule",
