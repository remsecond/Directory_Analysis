  "text": "Message 3667 of 4024\nSold as agreed below.\nWe lost 2k with the OFW delay in your response. Unfortunate, but a product of the way you operate. Once settled, I'm happy to move some of that\nto wherever you want. Of course, you have access as well so you can do the same.\nMy request is we treat the settled cash as 50/50 till we sort out more, but this gives you the money you said you needed. And I still have not heard\nwhat you did with the 35k I moved to BofA either. Not sure how to get you to tell me.\nSent:07/16/2024 at 11:22 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/17/2024 at 05:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: Near Term Money\nMessage 3668 of 4024\nI’ll respond here as you have indicated it is time sensitive, i gave you all the mail on Sunday. I had checked again prior to Allan as requested. I have\nbeen checking each day since, besides a first tech statement, no other mail has been received.\nSent:07/17/2024 at 07:03 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/03/2024 at 11:22 AM)\nSubject:Mail\nMessage 3669 of 4024\nHello!\nAs you may have seen, global cancellations for flights today.
