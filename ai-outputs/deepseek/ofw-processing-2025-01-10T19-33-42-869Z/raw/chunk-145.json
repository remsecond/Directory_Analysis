  "text": "Message 3560 of 4024\nChristine-\nAdrian met with Kari yesterday, and we received an excellent report card. During their conversation, they decided I would attend the next\nappointment to address some things on Adrian's mind. This is a significant breakthrough, as it's the first time he has agreed to have me join his session\nin all the months he has been going.\nI am excited about this opportunity, especially considering our near-total estrangement and the upcoming trip to Hong Kong, where all of these\nissues began after Elsa and your Mother's advice. The timing is perfect for a breakthrough, especially given the professional advice that there might be\nbetter ideas than the Hong Kong trip.\nI wanted to let you know that I was looking forward to a professionally facilitated discussion. However, you intervened and stopped it. You listed\nmany reasons against it and stated that Adrian voted against attendance because that would mean two full hours in a single week and you two felt like\nthat was too much to invest.\nMy Concerns:\n• I think you should have talked with me instead of letting Adrian vote on therapy without discussing it.\n• As the targeting parent, your influence in this discussion with him may affect his decision to talk to me.\n• You are making 100% of the mental health decisions for our family without any legal authority to do so.\n• This is not what the books Jennifer recommended say to do. We need to heed the advice we were given.\nReflection:\nDuring my first reunification meeting, you told Adrian that I had not blown, implying I was under the influence, which is medically impossible as I\nam on Vivitrol. Despite knowing this, you and Natalie demanded I take two 12-panel tests.\nThis is akin to giving Max a pregnancy test after a date – unnecessary and misleading. This demonstrates either a total lack of understanding of my\nsobriety program (big issue) or nefarious intentions. (bigger issue.) by you two.\nEither way, your actions misled Adrian, and you both used him as a pawn, especially troubling given Kari's concern that he was considering self-harm\nbecause he was caught in the middle when we started with her. He thinks this was him.\nRecap:\n• First reunification session: Adrian was misled and used as a pawn.\n• First requested Father/Son session: You unilaterally canceled it.\nMoving forward, I hope that any decisions regarding our children's mental health (or any other significant decisions) will involve me.\nAdditionally, I ask that we collectively make an effort to:\n• Start being honest with Adrian\n• Stop defaming me as his father\n• Avoid using Adrian as your pawn\nI remain optimistic because you were always a great mom before July. Even in December, when we had the Phase I parenting plan, things were good,\nand we worked well together.",
