  "text": "stopped every memory of me from him.\nFor AD's best interests, I would propose:\n• Increase my time with Adrian, including more frequent visits and activities. We saw each other daily this time last year\n• Consideration of family counseling sessions to help navigate our overall situation. You have never allowed this to happen.\n• Involve a family therapist or mediator to create a balanced, positive co-parenting environment. You have refused this.\nYou are probably not the best messenger as I am your target. He has no safe space as he has to please you for the basic necessities of life. And not\nexplaining the medical impossibility of what he said seems misguided. This of course, also calls into question past recollections from you and he.\nExample: Cabo is your favorite.\nAttachment theory explains that a child's emotional and psychological development is deeply influenced by the quality of their bond with their\ncaregivers. When one parent targets another, this bond is disrupted, making reunification therapy ineffective if it is bookended by the alienating\nparent's influence to and from the appointment.\nI'm committed to addressing any concerns you or Adrian might have to ensure he has a balanced, healthy relationship with both of us, benefiting his\nemotional well-being and our ability to co-parent effectively. Could we discuss a plan to help Adrian with professional support to ensure the best\npsychological outcome?\nMessage 3368 of 4024\nAdrian has a personal therapist.\nWe have engaged assistance of a reunification therapist who is tasked with this exact issue.\nI take issue with the accusations in the message below and ask that you stop.\nSent:06/28/2024 at 03:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 03:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification\nMessage 3369 of 4024\nSo my message was a response to your accusations, right? I mean no harm by replying.\nI still want to do everything in I can to be a healthy co-parent with you as well as help AD.\nIs it still your position not for us to get any professional help as suggested, and we agreed?\n\"winging it\" has gotten us to a point where we can't even talk. Wanna try another way now?\nI'm all in and will do anything to be a healthy and cooperative co-parent with you, Christine.\nSent:06/28/2024 at 04:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/29/2024 at 07:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification",
