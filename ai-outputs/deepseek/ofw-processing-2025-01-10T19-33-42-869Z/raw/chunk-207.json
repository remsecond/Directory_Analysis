But agreeing today and giving it serious thought is in itself still a commitment of great magnitude.\nThe fact that it happened after the week we had, in a sunny parking lot with church hymns singing in the background, was a sign of divinity.\nMy commitment to start the week:\n• No flames  for any reason\n• Write up and share Kari notes\n• Write up and share Alan notes\n• Tackle your Excel todo list\n• Find and start DV classes\n• Attend meeting with Jennifer\n• Go to ADs hoops tryout\nI’m sure there are more, but if you see something missing please just let me know. I assure you I will tackle it with speed and cooperation.\nIf we can even commit to giving each other a chance before handing it over to the lawyers, that alone is a huge victory for our kids & family.\nKids first! You and I, a close second\n• robert\nSent:08/18/2024 at 10:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/19/2024 at 08:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Miracles happen to those who believe in them\nMessage 3781 of 4024\nThanks.
