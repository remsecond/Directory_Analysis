But I will have to check to be sure. I’ve been trying to use that wherever I can.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 07:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3029 of 4024\nThis type of arrangement should be coordinated well in advance. We will need to make arrangements for an alternate date.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:00 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3030 of 4024\nWere you unaware that Adrian has a birthday?\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3031 of 4024\nFor that matter, I did the same thing with Max and you didn’t let me see him then either.\nSo you knew his birthday was coming. It happens on an annual basis. You knew I was going to ask I have done it for each one of my children.\nWhen we make alternate dates, you screw me. Like when you hadnChristmas Eve and I had Christmas Day, but then you really had Christmas day.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
