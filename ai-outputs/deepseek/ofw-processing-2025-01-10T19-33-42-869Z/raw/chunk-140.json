Mind letting\nMax have it? It’s stupid, cheap, but maybe funny. And it lets him know I still think about him no matter what.\nThat is one of the things parents who are targeted to be erased are advised to do. Like my volunteer stuff and attendance at everything he does. At\nsome point he will look back and know that the man who he is named after, loved him unconditionally.\nHe might even realize that if everyone got to just kick people out of their family when they were unhappy with them, there would not be any families\nat all.\nSent:07/10/2024 at 03:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 05:28 AM)\nSubject:Gifts From Dad\nAttachments:IMG_1550.PNG (1 MB)",
