  "text": "Message 3604 of 4024\nThis is untrue. If it is, send it to me. You won't because you can't—because it never happened.\nWhen you and Natalie try to save face by lying, it reflects poorly on you both as human beings.\nHave you read the correspondence?  I asked to solve this with you for days now. You would not.\nYou insisted on everything going through Natalie while on vacation. That is well documented.\nYou made you bed of lies and deception, stomped on my olive branch offer and then hung up.\nRemember- when you are wrong or embarrassed, you lie. It's what you do. Tumblecreek knows.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 05:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 06:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Are you Ok?\nMessage 3605 of 4024\nLanguage you sent is clear. See attached.\nMaintenance fees 50/50. 2024 maintenance is paid. You get 2025. I pay fees for units I don’t use.\nHow am I lying?\nWe asked to reschedule Rosen last week if this was the remaining issue. See attached.\nYou refused to cancel/reschedule for this one issue and continued to insist wasting money on this.\nIt is all documented.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 06:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 06:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Are you Ok?\nAttachments:IMG_0641.jpg (7 MB)",
