Thank you.\nSent:08/15/2024 at 01:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/15/2024 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please stop - An Oldie but a Goodie\nMessage 3717 of 4024\nAre you just trying to fight?  \"let's just get along. Hope you have a nice day.\" I was extending an olive branch again.\nWhy do you live just to destroy me now? It seems to be your whole mission in life. But it's bad for Max and Adrian.\nCan we please get along? Please? How do we go into reunification therapy warring with each other? Please!\nSent:08/15/2024 at 01:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Please stop - An Oldie but a Goodie\nMessage 3718 of 4024\nThis is a very serious situation. I do not want to escalate in anyway. But given that Max has come here in an ambulance with a heart arrhythmia and is\nunder evaluation for cardiac problem I actually need to know whatâ€™s going on with my son.\nI understand you got angry with a touch of the arm and said you would write to Connor to tell him I touched your elbow. I am OK with that. I did\ntouch your elbow lightly and said I am sorry but what I need to know is is Max OK?\nPlease save your escalations for after this. I told you we have a history of this condition in my family. That is important information. Please be the\nadult and tell Max he needs to let us parent and communicate about his emergency condition.\nSent:08/15/2024 at 10:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Please Contact Me\nMessage 3719 of 4024\nYou sent the doctor to the lobby after I left. And you knew that. Then blamed me. Now you cut off all communication again. This should be about\nMax. You just turn it on and off to attack me and threaten me, then turn it off. Please stop that. Please work with me on Max. I did not get to speak\nwith you or the Doctor now. I have no idea what you are doing! Please help.\nSent:08/15/2024 at 10:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Please Contact Me",
