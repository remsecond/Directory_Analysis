On\nanything.\nPlease just let me know if you feel like I have said something untrue that is harassing. That is not my intention and I’m more than happy to address if\nso.\nI’ll take your feedback and look back on our communications for “hate filled narratives” that are not discussing the kids or trying to work with you.\nAlso- how’s the Andy engagement coming? I think that was what had agreed was an “excellent idea.” Want to give it a shot instead of just inflaming\nthings?\nAnd please don’t take the kids to another country and severe communications on arrival. Especially after saying Hong Kong is now home for you and\nthe boys.\nHappy to work with you. Have a great day!\nSent:07/06/2024 at 06:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/06/2024 at 06:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW abusive harassing emails\nMessage 3466 of 4024\nI feel like this could be harassing.
