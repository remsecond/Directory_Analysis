Everything is transactional for you. It’s more than the investigation. I’m talking about the well-fair of our kids and keeping that part\nof them safe. So they can love and appreciate who they are, not feel shame. I’m trying to approach this in a holistic way where we can honor our past\nand not trash each other and that includes friends and family.\nYour response is always that it’s time to tell the truth. You’re tired of lying to people. I’m pretty sure that it’s up to you what you tell them about our\npast just as it is for me. I’ve been mum on all the things that we did. At the time we did them because we liked it. You, by contrast have started an\nadvertising campaign of destruction and defamation.\nSo I’m asking if can we agree to stop doing that and work on honoring the years we spent together. If you don’t understand, please take some time off\nwork and educate yourself. It’s not a knock, you just don’t  know. So I’m asking you to learn how your vengeful flamethrower approach is impacting\nthe kids.\nFrankly, I’m tired of having this discussion. All our messaging platforms are replete with examples of me, trying to get this under control and not treat\neach other in horrible, thoughtless, and inhumane ways that screw up our kids for the rest of their lives. I’m actually tired of trying to convince you to\nparent responsibly. It’s clear you don’t get it.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 10:45 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 02:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: I am not fighting , let’s cool off , ok?\nMessage 3023 of 4024\nWell, it’s unfortunate that this was the last mail you answered. Either way, I’m stopping now. Flame away\nSent:06/05/2024 at 10:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 02:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Too Hot",
