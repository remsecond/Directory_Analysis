I've seen those used with nefarious intent recently>>\nThanks you. I’m glad to hear that Max is physically okay after last night’s scare. I am concerned about the mental aspect, especially the screaming\n\"Robert stay away\" into the phone. That isn’t normal, and we should consider accelerating therapy as he is getting worse.\nRegarding his medication, as you know, Dr. Kwon involves me in discussions about Max’s Vyvanse—his dosage, diet, and overall health. Last time,\nwe agreed to reduce his dosage to 30mg and emphasized the importance of taking it daily, especially since he lost 10 pounds.\nI was surprised Max stopped taking his medication without consulting Dr. Kwon.

I realize it’s your work day so will be patient of course.\nLast night was rough. And we were doing so well. Let me know if you want to try  somehow.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 02:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3730 of 4024\nThis feels threatening give that first sentence in parentheses unless you are saying you were the one with nefarious intent.\nWhen you open with that what is your expectation for response?\nThese communications feel like a trap as anything I say feels like a “gotcha” moment.\nMax may have thoughts on who is involved in managing his healthcare and as I understand has a right to privacy now.\nHe is doing well.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 02:37 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 02:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max",
