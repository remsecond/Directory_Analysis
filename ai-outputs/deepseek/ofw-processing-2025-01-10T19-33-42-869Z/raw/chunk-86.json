  "text": "When our child expressed this belief, did you explain to him that being under the influence is not even possible for me? If a child believes something\nnegative and frightening that you know to be false and harmful, why not correct this misunderstanding? Why allow such a dangerous and impossible\nbelief to continue? Did you think that lie was in his best interest to believe?\nThis reminds me of our marriage. On Tuesday, scientific evidence proved my sobriety, yet Adrian still believed false information that you could have\ncorrected and did not.\nI'm asking why you didn't simply tell him the truth- \"what you saw is medically impossible, AD.\"\nMessage 3365 of 4024\nAdrian was unsettled by your behavior. Please address in reunifucation.\nSent:06/28/2024 at 07:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 09:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification\nMessage 3366 of 4024\nYou make a good point. Iâ€™m hearing you say this.\nUnsettling behavior he would attribute  to your drinking, should not be attached to your drinking.\nThe behavior Adrian finds unsettling and makes him uncomfortable is unrelated to your drinking and should be attributed to something else that is\nunknown.\nBut not to invalidate how he feels and his experiences.\nHe experienced behavior that made him feel uncomfortable in that session and spoke up. His feels are valid.\nSent:06/28/2024 at 07:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 09:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification\nMessage 3367 of 4024\nThanks. I'm getting very concerned that these misunderstandings are becoming more frequent as Adrian has less time with me. This pattern is\nworrying, as it aligns with symptoms of parental alienation. While I understand this topic is sensitive, we should address it for Adrian's well-being. He\nwas \"mini-me\" until you did this.\nYou have continued to limit contact between us, further creating a space for misconceptions to grow and create unfamiliarity. It's natural for children\nto struggle with understanding complex adult situations, but without regular, positive interactions with both parents, these misunderstandings can\nsolidify into harmful beliefs.\nLet's work together to increase my time with Adrian. This would allow him to form his own opinions based on direct experiences rather than\npotentially distorted perceptions. Regular, meaningful contact is essential for maintaining a healthy parent-child relationship. Remember you have\nSent:06/28/2024 at 09:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification",
