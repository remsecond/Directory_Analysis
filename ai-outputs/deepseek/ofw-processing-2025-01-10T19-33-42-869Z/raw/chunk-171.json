This is just unnecessary and inflammatory.... again. Please just stop.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 03:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 07:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Jennifer\nMessage 3649 of 4024\nWorking with me includes sending threats to kill me. Everyone I open OFW it scares me.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 03:23 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 03:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about\nMessage 3650 of 4024\nChristine, you are seeing things that are not there. That said it was in bad taste and I apologize again.\nIf you read the text, it says sending you an “olive branch to heal” that is the only message. Healing.\nI apologize again. Love you like crazy, would never hurt a hair on your body and still want to\nSent:07/15/2024 at 03:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 07:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about\nMessage 3651 of 4024\nI just finished one of the books again.
