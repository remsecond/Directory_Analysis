  "text": "Adrian said you arranged to come by the house and meet him on the street. I would advise against that.\nMessage 3059 of 4024\nI guess it did not work out tonight. Bummer because I was hoping to see him and just stop the gift nonsense by giving it to him there. But, just in case\nyou’re not tracking his basketball schedule, check it out. His next game will be Sunday and I’d love to watch him play again. Let me know if you need\nany help and I wouldn’t stress about tonight at all, it’s just a practice.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 06:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 06:32 PM)\nSubject:ADs Hoops\nMessage 3060 of 4024\nPlease call me.\nSent:06/07/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 06:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3061 of 4024\nNo.\nArranging to meet Adrian independently is deeply troubling. I will raise it with my lawyer and suggest you do the same\nSent:06/07/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 06:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3062 of 4024\nI didn’t arrange it, Christine. He asked if I could bring it over and meet me. Is that forbidden?\nI thought the whole reason you asked for supervised visit was because it was Adrian‘s wishes .\nIf we are only following Adrian’s wishes when it’s convenient to you, we may have a problem.\nCan I just put it on top of the mailbox and be on my way? If you turn on calls, I can coordinate w/ you.\nI really don’t want to fight. Please don’t make this about you. Please let AD have his gift Christine.\nIt will just be on top of the mailbox. Super simple. Super safe. Then you or he just grabs it!\nSent:06/07/2024 at 06:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/07/2024 at 07:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
