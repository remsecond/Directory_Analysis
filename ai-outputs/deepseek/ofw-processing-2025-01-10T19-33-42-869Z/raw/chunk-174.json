  "text": "Message 3659 of 4024\nI have shared that OFW and other forms of communications with you have become an unsafe space for me where I feel attacked and threatened,\ncausing great anxiety and fear. It is real for me.\nExample: I received in one day, two very direct OFWs, one attaching an article that discusses an ex boyfriend killing his ex girlfriend at her work place,\nstating how the recommended targeting was scary personal for you, and another “expressing concern” for my well being.\nThis is causing me great distress, they are alarming, I feel unsafe, threatened, anxious, and scared.\nBelow feels like another attempt to bully and shame me, disregarding my multiple communications to you, since you sent those specific ones\nreferenced, on the direct impact what you have sent has had to me. This is scary to me. I cry when I think about it and hyperventilate. I feel attacked.\nI have on multiple occasions expressed your communications feel unsafe and bullying and abusive and am doing so again.\nIt must stop.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 07:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 07:49 PM)\nSubject:OFW communications... unsafe to me.\nAttachments:IMG_0651_1.JPG (737 KB)\nMessage 3660 of 4024\nYou keep noting the poor joke about targeting but leave out what I wrote in my own hand:\n\"Wanna try again? I really would like to touch base briefly off this horrible, no good, awful platform and find some common ground.   \"\nEverything is selective interpretation with you and a reason not to partner on anything.\nIf you do not feel safe, I will accept that and will not exacerbate that. And I am sorry you feel that way. Please let me know if there is anything I can\ndo. I want nothing but the best for you.\nSent:07/15/2024 at 08:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/16/2024 at 07:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW communications... unsafe to me.\nMessage 3661 of 4024\nTrying my best to make progress here but your mental health comes first. I will need to move forward if you are not able to partner. Please let me\nknow about the things below that I need from you. I have been trying to solve these issues and the others that we had to mediate for a long time now.\nI have trimmed the list back considerably so we can focus better. Hope it helps.\nConfirm that you will be sending my mail over <<I really need the mail you did not send before you go. Please advise. It is time-sensitive>>\nAgree on Hong Kong communication expectations <<Please advise. This one is important to me. I don't want a fight. They are my kids too>>\nSent:07/15/2024 at 08:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/16/2024 at 07:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about",
