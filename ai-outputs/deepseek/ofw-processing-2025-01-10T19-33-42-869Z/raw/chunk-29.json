Adrian and I leave in less than two weeks for Canada.\nCabo you refused to return it. This forced us to change plans.\nI also received a strange text from your Mother. It appears she may not have been told the seriousness of the issues.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 09:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 09:23 PM)\nSubject:Re: Call\nMessage 3131 of 4024\nMy Mom knows that we are getting a divorce. But as mentioned many times, I have chosen not to engage in the same character assassination you\nhave.\nI don’t feel it’s helpful to have the kids grow up in a hateful and resentful family like you and yours. By contrast your mother is a reason we are here.\nYou and I are very different people. Your purpose in life is to hate, destroy, and rewrite our history and make sure everyone believes your false\nnarrative.\nI’m choosing the truth and a path towards a way that does not make our kids hate a part of themselves. The part that is each of us. You want the\nopposite.\nI had asked for a break, not another escalation.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 06:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Call\nMessage 3132 of 4024\nSo much for civil.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 08:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 08:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Call",
