Thank you.\nSent:06/27/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/27/2024 at 08:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Have a sec?\nMessage 3362 of 4024\nAdrian said he thought you had been drinking and appeared drunk based on your behavior, not that you had been drinking.\nAs I was not there, I could not comment on your behavior.\nI donâ€™t have visibility to your weekly random tests, so I am also unable to comment on that. I requested to be provided those results a while back.\nI informed him of your negative test.\nI agree. For a child of his age to have to navigate this issue must be stressful. I am proud of him as well.\nSent:06/27/2024 at 07:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/27/2024 at 09:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification\nMessage 3363 of 4024\nWait. Are you for real?  You have refused every single recommendation from every single therapist for the health and well-being of our Kids. You\nalways say no, no matter what.\nYurushka- Two family dinners a week - refused\nDebbie- Get a place, start new traditions - refused\nDr Brown- four full parenting plans- refused\nKarri- Joint family therapy session- refused\nAndy is known nationally. He was Dr Brown's mentor. He is the best in the business. And you, Christine, are going to follow email rules and skip the\nsingle most important point- have him on every mail. You are not in therapy with an expert if the expert is not in therapy.  So, it's a no.\nYou will not agree to anything that might help us help our kids. Your position is bonkers to me.\nSent:06/27/2024 at 09:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 07:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Have a sec?\nMessage 3364 of 4024\nI feel you haven't addressed my main concern. The issue isn't about tests or what you may or may not be aware of. The fact is, it's medically\nimpossible for me to be under the influence.\nSent:06/27/2024 at 09:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/28/2024 at 07:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drunk at Reunification",
