Please note number of emails you have sent today.\nI understand sticking point for temp plan is just the Cabo timeshares. I haven’t seen a response yet and saw the plan was to mediate this single issue\nwith Rosen and pay attorney fees. Is that still the plan?\nSent:07/08/2024 at 05:40 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 05:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3497 of 4024\nPlease give me the courtesy of the call.
