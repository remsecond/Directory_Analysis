I sent the tickets so you should have them in email to accept.\nAdrian was discussing about connecting with a friend tomorrow night.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 10:42 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 10:42 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3803 of 4024\nI don’t really have anyone else to go with.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 10:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 11:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3804 of 4024\nThank you for feedback in email. Fair questions.\nI have all plans plus emergency contacts including for me with Uliana, Elsa, boys etc. she also has your info. No major plans for boys other than usual\nactivities. It’s spotty for me starting shortly but will be back will full on Sunday afternoon.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 10:48 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 10:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3805 of 4024\nHaving your contact for emergencies is not helpful. You are saying you are off the grid and out of contact. I actually don’t understand any of what\nyou said below. Having the kids info does not make sense. That is who the emergency would be with. And I have zero idea how I get in touch with\nthe person that is responsible for my children. This, one week out of an emergency room visit for an unexpected emergency room visit for a very\nunusual heart condition.\nAll I see is you are unavailable, she has the kids contact info, and I have no way to contact her.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 10:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 11:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids\nMessage 3806 of 4024\nI have had conversations with cardiologists and am assured and feel comfortable with Max. It could never happen again or it could. He is aware as is\nUliana on protocol.\nSent:08/23/2024 at 11:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/23/2024 at 11:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Contact/Kids",
