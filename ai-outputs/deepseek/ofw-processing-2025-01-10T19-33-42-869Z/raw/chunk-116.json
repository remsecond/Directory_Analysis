  "text": "Message 3455 of 4024\nIt is always tough to talk to them when you have the kids. I think we saw that yesterday. Ideally, you would suggest some convenient windows to chat\nand even note some of your activities that I could ask them about so they know we are on the same \"parent team.\"\nIt is incredibly awkward for us to talk while they are on vacation and not be able to say, \"Tell me about your day\" without them feeling like they are\nbeing a spy by saying anything about their vacation or I am spying on them to try and figure out what's up.\nIf we can't find a good way to keep me current and in the loop with the kids, given all that you have arranged away from me overseas in July, it's going\nto be a super long month and really unhealthy. I'll need you to help overcome the barriers put up.\n• Nov-Feb: Saw AD about five times a week\n• March-June: Saw AD about three times a week\n• June-Today: See AD once every two weeks\n• July: I'll see AD twice this month after 66 days solo last summer\nThe longer I demonstrate my sobriety, the less I see my kids. So please help me stay in touch while you jet-set around the world, taking every single\nholiday they had since last year. Especially back to where they said, \"Mom said we are divorcing you in Hong Kong.\"\nYour help will be much appreciated as you have taken sole custody and left the country.\nThanks!\nSent:07/05/2024 at 05:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 07:39 PM)\nSubject:Communicating as You Take the Boys from Me All Summer\nMessage 3456 of 4024\nI disagree and below demonstrates why an actual discussion is unproductive given the summary below.\nI have shared previously my experience in a discussion is for you to document a narrative that is not an accurate representation.\nYou had sent the list to Lisa so I am uncertain what additional information you needed from me that had not already been sent to Lisa.\nSent:07/05/2024 at 07:39 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 07:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: ToDo List\nMessage 3457 of 4024\nI have asked that you keep your narratives and feelings out of these communications. I can’t respond to these when these are sprinkled in.\nI have shared I am not going to get into a back and forth about your accusations and narratives.\nIf you have an ask, please simply state it without the extra viewpoint or narrative. That would facilitate our communication.\nSent:07/05/2024 at 07:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 07:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communicating as You Take the Boys from Me All Summer",
