I’m not trying to be difficult. I just don’t understand what you’re saying. Also I’m pretty sure for the next visit. It’s Father’s\nDay so the occasion is kind of already taken.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 10:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/06/2024 at 08:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3039 of 4024\n.. we are well past the argument, I’d like you to turn these back on for urgent and emergency situations.

Thank you.\nIn that context, can we explore the communication protocols suggested four months ago, like allowing us to share things and have updates or decision\ndiscussions via email?\nWe are just trashing our relationship by putting artificial barriers to collaboration in place. I can say the same thing here as I can there, so there really is\nno reason to make things so divisive and impossible on purpose.\nSent:06/06/2024 at 10:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/06/2024 at 02:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications",
