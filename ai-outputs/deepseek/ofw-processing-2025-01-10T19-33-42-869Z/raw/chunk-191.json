I did\nhear that Robert wanted this weekend again with Adrian, and I agreed to another weekend visit this weekend.\nI understand at the last visitation they played ping pong and they had lunch. I would like your client to consider a more constructive activity with\nAdrian that would be a little more meaningful towards building a relationship. I think they might spend some time brainstorming with the supervisor\nideas and then there could be enthusiasm built around doing more fun activities.\nYou may know I have 6 boys (now adults) and 11 grandchildren, and they always wanted to do something and with nice weather that could be a\nsports game, an exhibition, a fair, go on a hike, etc and on rain days a science museum, a home depot project event, Dave and Busters- you get the idea.\nThere is so much to do around here I urge your client to build fun time and activities with Adrian as well as just doing lunch and a game of ping pong.\nNatalie de Maar\nAttorney at Law\nSent:08/14/2024 at 11:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/15/2024 at 05:29 AM)\nSubject:An Oldie but a Goodie",
