I don’t know how we got to this place but we need to leave it quickly.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 05:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 05:34 AM)\nSubject:Re: Please call\nMessage 3631 of 4024\nMay we please touch base tonight? I feel like we are on the cusp of communicating again. I hoped we were at a  stage where we both want to bring the\ntemperature down. But that’s only gonna happen if we start taking control of the situation. And that means understanding each others intent.\nI am more than willing to work with you and I keep trying to show you, so I hope you know that. If we can start with better communication I am\nsure we can work wonders together. I’m not going to push you, I’ll defer to the professionals and I think that should help. But nothing happens\nunless we can communicate.\nPlease respond. I do not want to escalate. No matter what. If it’s controlling to say chat tonight, fine,\nlet’s do it tomorrow. When you have time. I’m not going to push and make this a test of wills when we chat. But please communicate. Without that,\nnothing happens, except escalation. Please work with me.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 08:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 05:33 AM)\nSubject:Touch Base\nMessage 3632 of 4024\nWhat a new start really means to you on OFW - OFW is a safe place for communication. The OFW message sent with story about ex-boyfriend killing\nex-girlfriend at her workplace was very alarming and I felt very unsafe. It was and still is very threatening and scary to me. Communications to be on\nOFW and focus on issues related to the children. <<Sound good and I agree. But please note that my mail was clearly an attempt to make peace. This\nwas in no way a threat. I actually said: \"Wanna try again? I really would like to touch base briefly off this horrible, no good, awful platform and find\nsome common ground. \" It was sent in a playful way, referencing an ongoing joke we have had and it says specifically that I am extending an olive\nbranch to heal.. Adrian’s visit tomorrow and what he should bring - Done. <<Thanks. Super helpful>>\nConfirm that you will be sending my mail over - Done. <<I did not get the mail I needed. I had asked separately if you have checked the mail lately.\nPlease advise. It is important. >>\nDiscuss the mail I have addressed to both of us - Please confirm which one. <<Not worth the back and forth. I'm going to open>>\nConfirm your stance on seeing kids before trip - Adrian had a visit with you today as scheduled <<I'd like to consider the plan Lisa sent that was\ncreated with a child therapist that is at least a little closer to Dr Brown's advice. I will resend it again through the attorneys>>\nIf you plan to stay at war with me as promised - ?\nAgree on Hong Kong communication expectations - Please share what types of communications you are requesting from me and/or boys. <<I sent\nthis through the attorney. I will send it again if you won't talk to me and just agree. I trust you and would instead hope we just agree. I'm not going to\nbother you, I need a reliable way to get in touch with you and the kids>>\nAgree on practical terms of Fridays agreement - Please send your proposal. <<It is your plan. I just want to put some process around it.>>\nFigure out how to get camping stuff in garage - Please send your list. <<Thermarest is the most urgent. That is what I really need ASAP. Not the Kids,\nmine. Thanks>>\nSwap our thoughts on the house we both own - Please send your proposal. <<This is not an OFW email. It's a $3m decision that we need to swap\nideas based on goals. I'll consider this blocked>>\nSent:07/15/2024 at 07:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 01:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about",
