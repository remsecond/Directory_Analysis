It's fair to ask if you plan to start applying best practices>>\nMessage 3633 of 4024\nChristine\nI sent some notes in an email with ideas for halving up Fidelity, but I am going to need cash or a way to get money prior to you leaving. I can sell 100k\nbefore you go and move 50k to wherever you want. But I need money now, and if you are dark, I am going to have to go ahead with that. So please\nconsider this a formal request to work with you in a way that is consistent with our court order. I hope that on something as simple as this, you will\ncooperate as agreed.\nthanks,\nrobert\nSent:07/15/2024 at 01:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/15/2024 at 01:27 PM)\nSubject:Near Term Money\nMessage 3634 of 4024\nOk.
