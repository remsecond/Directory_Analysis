I’ve mentioned that for a few days and you said that you had sent it to your attorney. But you said\nyou knew your attorney was out. And I told you mine was.\nSo twe have been effectively blocked on a lack of information flowing freely . I noted that yesterday, but you insisted on doing it again all day today. I\nsaid Lisa was out but I would talk first thing in\nAfter five days of black out, I’m trying to solve this with you because you method does not work. Do you want to solve it or not?\nSent:07/09/2024 at 06:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/09/2024 at 06:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
