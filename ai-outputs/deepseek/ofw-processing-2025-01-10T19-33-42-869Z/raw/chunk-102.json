I'm trying here.\nTo confirm - you want the green light to travel to another country with the kids, but you refuse to provide details, an itinerary, or even to discuss the\ntrip so I know what is going on.  I'm more than willing to work with you on this, but it feels unreasonable. It is just the basics for travel.\nI don't get why everything has to be so hard with you. This should be so easy.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 06:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 06:21 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada authorization\nMessage 3422 of 4024\nI have shared dates and location with you. What details are you missing?\nYou had an opportunity yesterday in the 60min conversation to ask your questions/share your concerns and refused.\nIt is documented here.\nI’m done.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 06:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 06:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada authorization\nMessage 3423 of 4024\nI told you I don’t have it.\nI am not in front of my computer and not in a position ti be doing this. That’s why I tried to do this already.\nIf you can’t give it to me then forget it.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 06:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 06:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada authorization\nMessage 3424 of 4024\nOk. I broke free to search for the details you could have just shared instead of saying you already shared.\nAttached are my results. Please just share them instead of just saying you already have done it.\nI am happy to approve, I am just asking for the basics. If you shared i don’t see them. Please share again.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 06:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 06:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada authorization\nAttachments:IMG_1266.PNG (198 KB)",
