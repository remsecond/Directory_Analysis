Can we both just stop the back and forth accusations? We trigger each other and need to do better.\nCan we stop for at least today? It can be like drinking. You can only control the day you have. I think we can do that. Let’s just stop this for today.\nWe can decide again tomorrow...\nSent:07/06/2024 at 07:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: ToDo List\nMessage 3471 of 4024\n.\nSent:07/06/2024 at 10:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:36 AM)\nSubject:Are we good here now?\nMessage 3472 of 4024\nHey-\nJust checking in. I know your return time/date was a big, ambiguous window, so wondering if you had more specifics as Sunday begins. I’m not going\nto micromanage or hassle you at all, just hoping for an update on travel plans for the boys and your return.\nThanks!\nrobert\nSent:07/07/2024 at 09:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:35 AM)\nSubject:Moyer International Travel Plans\nMessage 3473 of 4024\nHey-\nSent:07/07/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/07/2024 at 10:32 AM)\nSubject:Help w/ Required Reading\nAttachments:IMG_1426.PNG (515 KB)",
