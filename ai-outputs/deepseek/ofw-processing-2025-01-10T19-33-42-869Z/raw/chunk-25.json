  "text": "How do I ever work with you peacefully ?\nMessage 3111 of 4024\nI'll take a \"no reply\" to move this forward as you blocking my attempt to save community funds.\nI brought it to your attention, and you agreed and asked for info, I provided it, and you went dark.\nSent:06/10/2024 at 10:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 07:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xbox Live\nMessage 3112 of 4024\nWhy are you pulling huge cash withdrawals out? I saw 600 today. Your spend and cash withdrawals have increased significantly that exceed anything\nthat is normal.\nWhere is the income that supports this? It’s just a depletion of your assets.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 05:57 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 07:35 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3113 of 4024\nYou just took 26K without telling me after we repeatedly discussed we would not do that. I don’t know if you’re gonna steal all our money or not. It\nfeels like you were using our community property to terrorize me now.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 07:45 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 07:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3114 of 4024\n? It’s all accounted for and to pay credit cards as I requested. You will/can see it all.\nCash withdrawals are large. I can move equivalent out too.\nAre you saying the 1k and 500 dinners are from community funds?\n.\nSent:06/11/2024 at 07:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/11/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card",
