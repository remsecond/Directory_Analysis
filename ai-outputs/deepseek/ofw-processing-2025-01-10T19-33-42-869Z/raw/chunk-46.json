Once you took everyone off the family plans, the bills did not go away; we just paid twice.\nAnd then for vacations, how we handle them. Let's not fight; we know the deal. All our \"at cost\" stuff was given away (Presidential, Executive, Studio)\nor is not usable till Oct. I know I banked Rancho, you canceled Sol Mar. Can we agree on something? If we can't let's not bother. Let's let the lawyers\nwork that out. I do not want to fight over it. It's really not worth it.\nSent:06/17/2024 at 07:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/17/2024 at 08:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: You are Super Dark\nMessage 3205 of 4024\nPerhaps have a plan for what we do in case that goes the way of the RO and TPP.\nSent:06/17/2024 at 08:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/17/2024 at 08:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Tuition",
