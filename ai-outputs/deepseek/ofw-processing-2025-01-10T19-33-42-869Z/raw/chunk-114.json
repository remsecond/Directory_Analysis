  "text": "Message 3446 of 4024\nInteresting conversation with AD. Of course the way he talks to me with you staring at him is almost unbearable to listen to. I truly ache for his soul.\nAnd those were your big plans? Stay home. Have you ever, in our entire 17 year history watched from the crows nest. You did today with intention\nand malice.\nYou are taking him out of the country tomorrow with plans to head to Hong Kong after. And you could not give an inch for us today. On this, of all\ndays to pick.\nI wish you had shown more grace and sensitivity ...\nSent:07/04/2024 at 08:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/04/2024 at 09:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3447 of 4024\nPlease don’t put Adrian in this position.

How do we handle “safe times” to chat. It was super uncomfortable for us both. I’m open to just agreeing that when he says the other one is\nthere, we just politely reschedule. How’s that?\nSent:07/04/2024 at 10:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 06:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3449 of 4024\nI agree.\nNoted you reference taking them to Hong Kong. Has that authorization been signed?\nSent:07/05/2024 at 06:13 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 07:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th\nMessage 3450 of 4024\nI have already reached out to Lisa.\nSent:07/05/2024 at 07:29 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/05/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: July 4th",
