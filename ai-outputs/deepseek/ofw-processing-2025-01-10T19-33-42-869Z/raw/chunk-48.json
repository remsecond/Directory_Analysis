You saw them yesterday. I’ve shared talking is very anxiety inducing to me.\nI’ve asked to fix the finances multiple times. The delay is causing stress now.\nFirst refusal to let me pay the credit cards, pay your own, then explosion when I try pay mine, because money was earmarked and then there would\nhave been no money left. Now there is no cash to cover the bills and I’m dependent on a stock sale.\nThe mortgage tuition and other big bills are due.\nSent:06/17/2024 at 09:34 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/17/2024 at 09:34 PM)\nSubject:Re: What is the deal",
