Max and I just met with her and she walked through her process. Includes assistances with students with neurodivergence needs and\nunderstands accommodations etc.\nBeauparlant’s have used her for a year and highly recommend.\nMax is onboard. Attached is her cost structure. I’d like to get started. She meets with him personally first few months. Her software for tracking is\ngreat.\nThoughts?\nSent:08/18/2024 at 05:23 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/18/2024 at 07:26 PM)\nSubject:Miller independent educational consulting\nAttachments:IMG_1226.jpg (6 MB)\nIMG_1227.jpg (6 MB)\nMessage 3779 of 4024\nSorry, I thought I’d gotten back to you earlier tonight on this. I looked through her site and did some more research. She’s actually very impressive. I\nwas a little skeptical when I saw the pictures of the handout. But I agree with you. Dawn and Dave’s approval also speaks volumes to me. Looking\nforward to seeing the software of course! Thanks for keeping me in the loop.\nSent:08/18/2024 at 10:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/19/2024 at 08:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Miller independent educational consulting",
