  "text": "The best practices were what we paid Dr. Brown for. Not you picking email rules and ignoring the actual therapist part of the engagement noted\nbelow.\nBest practices are actually in the two books that Jennifer asked you to read. Should we agree that we will start following those now? I’m game.\nMessage 3490 of 4024\nI have taken it up with Lisa, and she has sent emails to Natalie. Those have been ignored last week.\nNow you know that they have been ignored, is it still your advice for me to go through legal channels?\nDivorce and child custody is a $28 billion business. I’m asking to do something helpful for Max and Adrian not pay for college and vacations for\nsomeone else.\nYou outsourced parenting to lawyers. I’m going to hold firm that they may be well intentioned but unqualified to be my kids decision makers.\nCan we discuss seeing the kids this week. They have no plans. I was 100% in charge this time last year and am only more sober and more responsible.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 11:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 12:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3491 of 4024\nI am not free until after 5:30 today.\nWe responded in regards to more time.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 12:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 12:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3492 of 4024\nI am happy to chat after 5:30. Just let me know when.\nIf you have responded, you made my point. Our conversation and the mental health outcome of our kids is sitting somewhere in an email folder\nbetween the three degrees of separation established in the $28 billion parenting model that’s been chosen. (that number is 5-years old btw)\nThis time last year I was floating down the lazy river and lining up for adventures in Leavenworth with both our kids, their friends, and Katherine’s\nfamily. I was an amazing dad then and have only improved. There is no legal reason for me to be blocked right now so we should discuss how I can\nparent our kids.\nI will not be #erased.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 12:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 01:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week",
