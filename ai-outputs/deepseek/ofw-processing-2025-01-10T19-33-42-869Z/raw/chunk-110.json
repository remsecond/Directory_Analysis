We were making progress and listening to each other. You refused, disappeared for 24 hours, and\nnow after 19 emails so far on the Canada auth, I still don’t know what you’re doing with my kids in another country. I’m stepping away. I am tired of\nbeing your fuel.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 11:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/03/2024 at 06:06 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian/details of Bellevue home",
