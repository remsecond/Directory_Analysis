Your glee in not coparenting is something I’ll never understand.\n• I wish you well V\nSent:06/21/2024 at 03:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 04:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hangers\nMessage 3320 of 4024\nGot it- Therapy counts as 1-1 visitation time to you.  I disagree but you twist it up as you like.\nThen, the next time I see him will be in two weeks. He has expressed concerns to us that I have documented and shared that \"Alan\" time is not real-\ntime. So you know that. Given that is the only thing that you are even permitting this summer, is it fair to say that I might not get to have this\nconversation mano-mano till there is a parenting plan (Sept?)\nStepping back, you, as a highly educated person, have to be able to see that you have decided unilaterally to be a vigilante parent, unenforceable by\nlaw. You have had 4 lawyers, 6 therapists, and 7 parenting plans. And here we are. You have effectively learned how to \"donald trump\" family law. It's\nunenforceable, just my choice not to be an a-hole about it.\nSo when can I see my son 1-1 to discuss the trip? That is healthy for him mentally of course.\nSent:06/21/2024 at 04:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 04:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Boys update\nMessage 3321 of 4024\nObviously, you can’t legally say I can’t go say hi to my son when he arrives back from his field trip, but I want to be respectful. Do you have any issue\nwith me being there just to give him a hug, welcome him home, let him know that I’ve been tracking him, and then send him on his way? It’s a nice\nway to show him I care.\nThanks!\nSent:06/21/2024 at 04:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/21/2024 at 04:34 PM)\nSubject:AD Pick Up\nMessage 3322 of 4024\nI’m not comfortable with that.
