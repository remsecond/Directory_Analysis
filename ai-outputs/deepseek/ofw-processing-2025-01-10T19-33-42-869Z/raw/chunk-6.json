I am asking when I can see my son for his birthday. I do not need special plans. I would just like to\nsee my son for his birthday. Surely you knew that was coming.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 10:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3036 of 4024\nWe were having an active discussion back-and-forth and you just walked away.\nA minimum if you’re going to block me from my youngest child on his birthday, I would like to work with you to craft joint messaging so I do not\nmake you look bad. I’m not gonna say anything negative. I never do. But I would like to at least explain what we will be doing in the future as a make\nup for this. So that’s where I need your help.\nObviously, I will be talking to him tomorrow since it’s his birthday and you won’t allow me to see him. Please consider his feelings and respond in a\ntimely way so we speak with one voice and don’t put him in the middle. I avoid that at all costs because that makes him hate himself and consider self\nharm, as we have seen recently.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 10:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian's Birthday",
