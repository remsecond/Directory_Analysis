  "text": "Message 3176 of 4024\nPlease use OFW for communications.\nI did not tell Adrian about the schedule and potential conflicts - That is an untrue statement.\nI told Adrain there was try outs tonight. He asked if I had paid, I said yes for try outs only.\nStated he did not want to do it.\nI asked if you had spoken to him about participating in the league. He said no. I said, I thought he wanted to and had discussed with you. If there was\na miscommunication, to connect with you directly.\nYes - Agree to engage lawyers on this one.\nSo, AD said you spoke to him and let him know he would be gone for the summer. I think I will take issue with your assertion of 100% parental\ncontrol. Please don't go after him again like you did last time because of what he said to me.\nWe don't need to argue. This one is clearly for the lawyers.\nSent:06/14/2024 at 04:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 04:05 PM)\nSubject:Local Hoops - Adrian desire not to do it\nMessage 3177 of 4024\nAre you copy and pasting words between platforms?\nSent:06/14/2024 at 04:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 04:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Local Hoops - Adrian desire not to do it\nMessage 3178 of 4024\nSo you don’t need my approval for anything this summer.
