  "text": "You are not the V, I knew and loved as a great mom for 30 years. Something happened. If you have the occasion to hear me out, I have a very sound\nphysiological explanation of events from last year. But the nature of your situation is you will never investigate personal shortcomings.\nEither way- when you reload for the next drive-by, you can at least see what you signed.\nI honestly do wish you well. It's tough talking to the person who took my soulmate away.\nMessage 3335 of 4024\nThese messages are not appropriate. I ask you stop.\nSent:06/22/2024 at 07:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 07:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up\nMessage 3336 of 4024\nWhich part?\nThat you were a great mom at one time?\nWe do not have a signed parenting plan?\nYou answear and then log off for 12 hours?\nThis is not a dig, I’m sincerely asking you.\nSent:06/22/2024 at 07:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 09:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up\nMessage 3337 of 4024\nPlease see Andy’s rules. If you want to use him please consider using the guidelines he provides\nSent:06/22/2024 at 09:06 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 09:06 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up\nMessage 3338 of 4024\nI’d love to use him. How do we want to proceed?\nObviously he has to be involved for us to use him. It’s not just following email rules and pretending we have a therapist. We could have done that for\nDr Brown, Andy, the OFW suggested best practices, etc... for months now. We need the accountability.\nLet’s game plan on engaging and I’m all in. Want to take the lead?\nSent:06/22/2024 at 09:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/22/2024 at 09:55 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Pick Up",
