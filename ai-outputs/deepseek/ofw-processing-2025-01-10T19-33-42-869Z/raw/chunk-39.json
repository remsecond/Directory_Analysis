If we both agree on something, we can type it up in real-time together rather than bicker after the fact.\nI am honestly trying to use our history to figure out a safer path to constructive collaboration.\nMessage 3169 of 4024\nSorry for getting snarky. I get really tired of our inability to communicate when you don't reply, but I should try not to let that impact my tone.\nApologies.\nSent:06/13/2024 at 06:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 06:46 PM)\nSubject:Snarky\nMessage 3170 of 4024\nGiven the history, we are both hesitant to make decisions without legal, so connecting again would not be helpful.\nAs you summarized in the call, there was no resolution to anything.\nIf you think there is a topic that can be resolved lmk.\nSent:06/13/2024 at 06:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 06:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can you give me a ring?\nMessage 3171 of 4024\nWe could’ve made decisions on the call, but we agreed not to because we would do it later.\nPlease let me know when we can talk so we can make some decisions on the things we put off.\nSent:06/13/2024 at 07:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 08:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Can you give me a ring?\nMessage 3172 of 4024\n• You know I reply to messages as soon as they land so we can resolve issues we are having. You log off immediately anyway.\n• I asked to watch all our money and spend in 2023. You refused to give me this information. You want that from me now.\n• I approved the Christmas trip in Dec despite how wrong it was to do given our existing plans. You used that again me.\n• I asked we follow your rules and put things we need to speak with counsel, on in the parking lot. You used that again me.\n• I offered to follow your rules and use an agreeable format for issue resolution to chat later. You agreed, and now say no.\n• Over the last few months, I have asked to work with you more times than I can count to do this civilly. You have refused again.\nSent:06/13/2024 at 10:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/14/2024 at 08:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Can you give me a ring?",
