  "text": "Message 3593 of 4024\nI have said it is a poor use of time and money to use Rosen to argue developer weeks.\nYour choice to use Rosen.\nIt is documented we have tried for days to ask about Rosen. The documented was agreed except for Cabo.\nYour choice.\nI will see what time your lawyer responded.\nAs you noted I was behind and decision was already made which you refused to tell me.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 01:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 01:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: You requested Judge Rosen\nMessage 3594 of 4024\nYou stated you responded already and I was behind.\nOur side has asked if this is the only issue but your side has repeatedly refused to put this to bed and reschedule Rosen.\nBall is in your court.\nIf you did not want to go to Rosen for this issue, why wasn’t he cancelled last week?\nThat was only issue remaining last week? We have repeatedly asked this question.\nThe delay and refusal to cancel had been on your side.\nYour side is either intentionally avoiding this topic, or secretly planning to do Rosen and not being forthcoming.\nEither way your side must know financial impact of delaying the decision to cancel or reschedule this late.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 01:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 01:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Rosen\nMessage 3595 of 4024\nThis is so stupid.\nHow about this- you are 100% right. I am dumb, you are smart. I am ugly, you are pretty. I am bad, you are good.\nI’m done fighting with you over anything to do with this. I am going to focus on the mental health of my children.\nSent:07/11/2024 at 01:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 05:23 PM)\nSubject:Re: You requested Judge Rosen",
