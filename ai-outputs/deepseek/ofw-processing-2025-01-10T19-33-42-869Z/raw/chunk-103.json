And my search results here and in email show you have not sent them. This is a travel\nconsent.\nThose things are different and I am getting frustrated when this could have been a 30 second call and you don’t seem to understand the ask on the\nfourth try.\nI am going to sign it in good faith with the ask that you send me the itinerary by tomorrow. Please let me know if you still don’t understand my ask.\nSent:07/02/2024 at 07:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 10:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Canada authorization\nMessage 3428 of 4024\nI don’t see an itinerary my email.
