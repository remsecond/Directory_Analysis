As he is 16, he only needed one parent to sign / be present.\nI could only pay with a check so I had to write against the jt Bank of America account. I’m going to transfer 250 in there now to cover for when the\nchecks are presented by the state department and King county in the next two weeks or so.\nAsking that the balance not be drawn below this amount so they checks do not bounce.\nI’m going to work on setting up my individual BofA account to allow me to write checks which currently it does not.\nSent:12/03/2024 at 03:39 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/03/2024 at 03:57 PM)\nSubject:Max passport / fees\nMessage 27 of 287\nThanks!
