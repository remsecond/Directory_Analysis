My portion is in jt BofA but it will bounce as you loved your funds out.\nGardener came for weeding and I will pay him cash of 203 today. Your portion is 100.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 08:56 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nI thought we talked on the 19th.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 08:46 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOFW is mode of communication between you and I as I understand.\nOn 12/27/2024 at 07:10 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nSo I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we can’t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or\ncompliance folks always on the thread for personal stuff.
