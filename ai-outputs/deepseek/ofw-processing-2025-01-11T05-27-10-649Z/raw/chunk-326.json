One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better\nparents.\nThe presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or\nnever saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.\nBut if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids\nfuture. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.\nI do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what\nwe will do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.\nWe moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.\nMessage 167 of 287\nPlease stop fighting with me.\nSent:12/16/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nOn 12/15/2024 at 11:50 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 08:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\n\"That put me in debt and ruined my credit\" - I will give you an opportunity to correct the record.\nIf not, I will take this as another instance of gaslighting me and ask you share with Sound Practices.\nOn 12/15/2024 at 06:08 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 11:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nI think everything I said is true.
