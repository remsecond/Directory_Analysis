I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said\nyou won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was\nkinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of\nclown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nMessage 266 of 287\nI’ll  send this to Cimberleigh. She asked I share these types of comms.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 09:45 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 09:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:39 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 09:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nIs he still coming over today?\nFor that matter, if they are in a car wreck getting here, what is your and Natalie’s plan for us to communicate and figure that out?
