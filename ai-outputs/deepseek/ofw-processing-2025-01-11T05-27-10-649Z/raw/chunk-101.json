  "text": "I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his communications to others, not just me.\nI was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into\nmediation so there should have been no surprise.\nBelow is blaming me again.\nI’m looking forward to speaking with Sound  Practices. I understand they were supposed to reach out to me, but I have not heard from them to\ndate. Is below how they encourage you to address this issue and communications with me?\nOn 12/07/2024 at 12:59 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 07:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nI am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I\nasked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.\nHe will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then\nnothing he says will matter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how\nclose you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my\nproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.\nSo just asking - did you take a vote again?\nOn 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nThe place to discuss was mediation.\nWe can agree to disagree.\nOn 12/07/2024 at 06:21 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/07/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nDid you miss the question here?\nDid Adrian and Max vote again?",
