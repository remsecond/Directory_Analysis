I don’t like being the\n“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.\nThis makes me feel uncomfortable.\nOn 12/13/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI don’t know?

And go straight into a session. Just\nhearing that already sounds draining to me.\nBut if we shift it might work better and we can all couch camp. It’s and idea because I don’t want a big backlog of makeups which could\notherwise be Thurs, tomorrow, maybe Whistler Sat... ?",
