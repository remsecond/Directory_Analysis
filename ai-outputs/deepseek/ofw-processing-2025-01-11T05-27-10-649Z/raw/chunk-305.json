And go straight into a session. Just\nhearing that already sounds draining to me.\nBut if we shift it might work better and we can all couch camp. It’s and idea because I don’t want a big backlog of makeups which could\notherwise be Thurs, tomorrow, maybe Whistler Sat... ?\nOn 12/13/2024 at 11:47 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nThanks.
