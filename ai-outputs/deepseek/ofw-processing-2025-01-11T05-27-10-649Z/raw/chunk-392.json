Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts\nfor us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last\nweek.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:13 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 12:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nI’m not fighting.
