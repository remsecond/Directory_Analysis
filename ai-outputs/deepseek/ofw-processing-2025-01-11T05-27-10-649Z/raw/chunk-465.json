But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like\nretaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:\n• Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.\n• The portrayal to Adrian that I \"won't reply\" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.\n• Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.\n• The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.\nPlease maintain our message thread rather than forking and creating new ones. Forking threads can misrepresent the context and chronology of\nour communication, which has happened a lot since this began. I don't think that is helpful to either of us when seeking helpful advice.\nLooking forward to understanding a healthier way to address the points above, as they were not addressed in a constructive way.\nrobert\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:45 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 09:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nI’ll  send this to Cimberleigh.
