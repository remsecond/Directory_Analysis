You were actually kind enough to\nsend the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.\nAs noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were screen\ncaptured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.\nNeither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we should\nperhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.\nOf course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.\nSent:12/18/2024 at 11:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 11:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nOn 12/18/2024 at 07:06 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 07:07 AM)\nSubject:Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nAttachments:IMG_2466.PNG (229 KB)\nWhy was this sent to me?
