I am more than happy to go along with the plan.\nOn 11/30/2024 at 07:33 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 11/30/2024 at 07:47 PM)\nSubject:Expenses prior to Oct 31\nPer spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.\nLisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week \"reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24\" but it seems you have a\ndifferent interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.\nConfirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.\nMessage 9 of 287\nAwesome!
