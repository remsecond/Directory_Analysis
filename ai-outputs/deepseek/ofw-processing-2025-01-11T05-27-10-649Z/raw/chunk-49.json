  "text": "asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.\nHe will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then\nnothing he says will matter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how\nclose you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my\nproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.\nSo just asking - did you take a vote again?\nOn 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nThe place to discuss was mediation.\nWe can agree to disagree.\nOn 12/07/2024 at 06:21 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/07/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nDid you miss the question here?\nDid Adrian and Max vote again?\nOn 12/06/2024 at 02:10 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/06/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:What Happened Today\nWe should decide how we constructively address today.
