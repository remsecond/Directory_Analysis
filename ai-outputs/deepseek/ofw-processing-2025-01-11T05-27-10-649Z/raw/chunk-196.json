Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.\nThat note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.\nJust let me know if you still have that interpretation.\nOn 12/03/2024 at 10:12 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/03/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nAttachments:BIlls_or_Accusations.jpg (165 KB)\nI'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We\nhave discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.\nWhen I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the\nlanguage used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.\nI am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in \"gotcha accounting\" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I\nsuggested so we can do this in a constructive way.\nOn 12/01/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 06:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nSure. And I assure you that I will work on this prior to mediation. I want us to have a crack at it. I’m not trying to surprise you, I’m trying to\nwork with you.\nOn 12/01/2024 at 03:03 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 03:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nOk. Will discuss in mediation unless you get feedback from Lisa prior, my interpretation is correct and you will pay that amount.\nThank you",
