The\nkids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard\nto build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this\ndiscussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nSent:12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

From the very beginning, even in our first\nmeetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I\n\nfeel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on\nthe scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been\nused for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,\nand you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t\nreciprocated when it came to dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,\nand ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the\nIRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so\nhard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even\nhave this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m\nnot doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for\nthe wrong things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.\nThe gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when\nyou said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a\nmistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.\nIf you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim\nexample. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?\nSo I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”\nOn 12/17/2024 at 02:56 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nWe have to use OFW.\nThe running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.\nSaying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context of what was happening.\nThe DV was real and confirmed.\nYou have all info and feedback on finances as requested.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 12:55 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Running List\nYou have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries.

Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely\ndisqualifies him for advanced placement in math.\nThis is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead.
