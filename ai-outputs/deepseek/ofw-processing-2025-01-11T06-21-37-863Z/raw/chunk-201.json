  "text": "Message 2169 of 4024\nI am not sure what you want. We are supposed to call for something urgent. You don’t answer OFW. I need to discuss what I can do without Max\nfeeling uncomfortable tomorrow but I know you are not going to answer. I want to participate in his life. I have a commitment I made to SAAS. This\ndoes not work if you hang up before I get to the question then won’t answer. Now you just try and make me look bad because you cut off all agreed\nto communication and I try to get an answer. If you ever bother checking in please let me know when I can have the 10 second conversation I asked\nfor. That is it.\nSent:03/15/2024 at 07:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2170 of 4024\nIt’s two questions. One about parent volunteer time, and one about general attendance wrt Max.\nSent:03/15/2024 at 08:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2171 of 4024\nThis isn’t really fair to me as a coparent. I’m trying to get some information because all this starts early in the morning and you are not going to get\nback to me in time. You are intentionally not allowing me to coparent at all at this stage. Nothing... even on the event that i set up. I am the one who\nsigned up for it.\nAnd you are an acting as the sole go between Max and I. It’s not combative or controversial questions. And i set it up, but you have blocked me from\nbeing involved now. Allowing me to understand how I can participate in a constructive capacity is not too much to ask given you built this barrier.\nAnd given the timing and disregard for our agreement for communication it is urgent to get clarity. My relationship with my son. And my\ncommitment to the school that I had to work miracles on to get Adrian into after your way got him rejected are super important to me. It was to you\ntoo, when you asked me to fix it. This is unfair Christine.\nIt’s a simple, quick conversation. That’s it.\nSent:03/15/2024 at 09:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 07:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2172 of 4024\nRobert your urgent call to me was to communicate you felt something was wrong with me and I should get help. That was not urgent and you\nabused the need to call me.\nAfter I told you I felt that was inappropriate for you to tell me and was in similar vein of telling me something was wrong with my brain, you kept\ninsisting.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 07:46 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 09:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent - Something is wrong with you",
