  "text": "Moved another 10k to BofA this am.\nThanks!\nP. S. Not trying to fight. But it is an example of where I can forward it to you, but I still can’t say “Hey- this for 10k” because it doesn’t show in the\nemail. I can come here and tell you that, and be nice or a jerk, or do it there and be nice or a jerk. But here we can’t reference anything else in the email\neffectively that’s relevant (ex: links, details, schedule graphics) because it’s not here. It just makes it more difficult. That’s all!\nMessage 1764 of 4024\nHey- Can I see Adrian soon? Thanks!\nSent:03/01/2024 at 12:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 01:14 PM)\nSubject:Visitation\nMessage 1765 of 4024\nThat email while I shared I am in back to back was unfair.\nI plan to submit a temp proposal to my attorney, which include in phase 1, Adrian has time with you but no over nights to build back trust as he ad\nrequested, then phase 2 the schedule we had prior to the surveillance.\nIn regards to reunification, I have no idea what you are communicating to potential candidates, but it seems in reading responses perhaps you have\nnot been forthcoming about your role and harm. It appears you mentioned 5 different therapists and failed interventions. Are they aware of the exact\nreasons or perhaps you are pinning on me as you do in these emails and is my fault.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 01:18 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 01:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visitation\nMessage 1766 of 4024\nI explicitly mentioned that you were busy. And I moved the ball forward in everyone’s best interests. I also said I am responsible for a\ndisproportionate part of the blame. I hope nothing was a dig, not my intent.\nSubmit what you like. We went to Dr Brown for a reason twice. If both times you refuse to follow her professional guidance after demanding it as a\ncondition to not press charges, that’s your decision.\nWith regard to reunification, only a fool would try and portray himself as the hero and you as the villain going into this. I am asked questions I I\nanswer them. They evaluate based on that. No one will touch us.\nI know you’re very busy today, and I don’t plan on fighting with you no matter what. You don’t need that drama while you’re trying to do your job.\nHappy to work with you when you have time. Let me know!\nOther:\n• What are your expectations wrt the RO? Are you still thinking? Just let me know.\n• I’ve been blessed to see AD for 2 weeks. Please see the original question asked.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 01:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 01:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visitation",
