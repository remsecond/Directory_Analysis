We are serving them breakfast next week. I never miss a single thing he does. What has gone on that we could go from playing and\ncuddling the last time I was there while you were in New York to him running in fear from me. This is fucked up\nSent:03/10/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics\nMessage 2062 of 4024\nI’ll leave that up to you. I am uncertain how to navigate.\nTBH in my opinion, it shows you are supportive of him, and have interest in him.\nPerhaps just give him space but he sees you are there.\nHe will remember the intent was there, and perhaps reframe in his mind, once you work together on the dynamic.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics\nMessage 2063 of 4024\nSee prior message.\nMy perspective (I am not a professional)  is he is scared of showing you in person, but has now been allowed to process the trauma and past and\nvalidate how he felt in that moment.\nSimilar to when Adrian texted you about why you did all those things from those vacations, he needs to understand it too.\nThat’s why reunification therapy is so important in my mind.\nJust my two cents.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 01:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics",
