I’ll try and do that this week. The other thing busted is our connect. I\nwill need to replace that but have found a used on Amazon.\nJust want to give you a heads up. The choice is to not use probably 8-10k in old stuff we already own, or upgrade everything and get 30% off through\nSonos. So I’m erring on the side of $370 vs $7,000\nOther Sonos stuff I’d like to put into use:\n• Sonos sub (was there on moving day)\n• Mailbox Sonos speaker\n• Side yard Sonos speakers\nWe could knock this out in about 30 minutes, a ladder, and a hammer, I would guess. BTW - I always kept the key IN the mailbox on purpose. Is that\nSent:03/03/2024 at 01:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 02:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>\nAttachments:IMG_1755.PNG (744 KB)\nIMG_79E1CE3B-413B-4890-BB7C-B1CF25A0B352.jpeg (3 MB)",
