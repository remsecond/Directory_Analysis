He and I go to all four stores at the mall when\nhe visits. We also surf all the specialty sites together. Then swap pictures of shoes almost every day. I also have these authenticated and arriving Friday\nfrom eBay. It is literally our jam. Would you consider letting me take him? We speak the same language...\nSent:02/21/2024 at 09:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 06:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\nAttachments:IMG_1554.PNG (392 KB)\nMessage 1538 of 4024\nYou guys did this to me?
