Please get help.\nIt has been communicated to me directly, by multiple professional that we both agreed to engage with, that have observed your interactions with me,\ncommunications, and knowledge of history,  the alarming nature of your behavior and what it is.\nYour assertions that it was a system and I was a party to it, takes away from true recognition of your behavior and impact to me and kids.\nI’m not here to convince of it. But telling you the facts. You can accept it or not.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 08:38 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 08:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..\nMessage 2220 of 4024\nPlease don’t cherry pick professional advice. I have an equal number of professional advices that guarantee we were in a system. That also say the way\nthat you unilaterally blame me for what has transpired in our marriage does not make sense. They have also pointed out after speaking with you that\nyou were setting traps for me just to make a self fulfilling prophecy appear to be true.\nWe can opinion shop till we find the ones that we agree with or you and I can just choose to start this over and be friendly to each other I’ll point out\nthat you telling me to get help is the equivalent of what you asked me not to tell you to do so please don’t do that either. If you indeed have a therapist\nthat says only one person took party in this marriage of 25 years and relationship of 30 years. Please send them my way today. I will call them today.\nI’d also point out that you don’t trust mental health professionals, opinions when they disagree with you. You only go with the ones that suit your\nnarrative. And then you read the Internet and turn to your lawyer for professional mental health advice.  So please quit doing that. I’m going to\nreiterate again if you and I could have a couple minutes today just to chat we could start the day on a good foot. Please consider.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 08:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 08:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..\nMessage 2221 of 4024\nI’m out trying to fix all the crap that went sideways yesterday. Any chance you can let me know if I’m going to get sideswiped today? Thanks!\nSent:03/19/2024 at 04:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 05:10 PM)\nSubject:Surprise!\nMessage 2222 of 4024\nAnnaLisa is going to set up a call with your lawyer, hopefully for tomorrow or Thursday to discuss our proposed temp PP.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 05:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 05:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Surprise!",
