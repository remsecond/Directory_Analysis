  "text": "gone?\nJust let me know how we can do that while I’m still knee deep in this so I don’t context switch for too long and forget. This is fairly complex stuff tbh.\nHave fun skiing!\nMessage 1815 of 4024\nGreg will be here this week so I can ask for his help for side yard Sonos.\nSonos in mailbox, key is jammed. I’ll see if I can wiggle it again.\nI’ll look for Sonos sub. I might have put in a box but did not send over as it was not on your list and subsequently put in the garage\nSent:03/03/2024 at 02:54 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>\nMessage 1816 of 4024\nThank you!\nCorrect, I did not list each one of the Sonos speakers or individual component type as separate line items as you note below.\nI thought saying the “Sonos stuff” would be inclusive enough to include anything that was branded Sonos. Lesson learned.\nI would not mind the extension cords on the outdoor speakers and mounts as well. They are expensive to replace.\nI’m going to hold off on the component below for now. It’s expensive so I’m going to try and exhaust all ideas first.\nIf you spray WD-40 in the key hole it should loosen. It’s in the broom closet, or where the garage cam sat or near.\nI’ll try and think if I’m missing anything I need to add details to, but for now please consider power cords as necessary also.\nThanks!\nSent:03/03/2024 at 03:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 05:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>\nMessage 1817 of 4024\nWill do. I am uncertain when Greg will be here but will put in his list.\nSent:03/03/2024 at 05:23 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 05:23 PM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>",
