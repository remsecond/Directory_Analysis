I will do my best this week to try harder and aspire to more constructive\ninteractions in text and in person. Best wishes.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 06:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 07:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Triggered\nMessage 1648 of 4024\nUpdates for the next RO-\nThanks for the constructive feedback. We will adhere to all the \"child or property\" related constraints as well as the civility and tone standards that\nneed to be observed. We will do this in a way that addresses your very real concerns about feeling like the mediums below are misused for attacks and\nthreats. Ideally, this is a baby step in a phased approach to normalcy.\nBelow is what I think we can agree on. I included \"urgent updates\" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have\nplans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an \"emergency\". School nurse call or missed\ndrop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent.\nBlessed Updates:\n• Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.\n• Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for \"fyi\" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary.\nOther Updates:\n• We sent Anna Lisa a request to remove a \"credible threat for physical violence \" last week, which I'm sure you saw.\nI think this covers the most critical obstacles to a constructive working protocol. I even think it could accommodate a \"running list\" format if we\nmutually agree it fits the definition proposed. If you do not, I am open to updating if you like, or just not facilitating that discussion for now. But I\nthink we desperately need it, and just need to be disciplined not to pervert the intent.\nI truly hope this is an accurate interpretation of your wishes and accommodates your concerns. If you feel like I am trying to nefariously manipulate\nyou or the situation, I am all ears. That is not my intent. It would be great to have this in place this week and see what it gets us. If you green light, I\nwill send to Lisa this AM. You may need to push Anna Lisa. tbh, she is slow. I am hopeful.\nbest\nrobert\nSent:02/26/2024 at 07:10 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 07:11 AM)\nSubject:Round II: RO Updates\nMessage 1649 of 4024\nAgree to RO updates.
