Not sure what this charge is. Did you flag the other fraud charges in your Amex?\nDid you ever get the refund for overpaid insurance from cobra? I sent you our paperwork a few months back. I have not seen that refund or Beth’s\ncheck, or kids Christmas money. I’m assuming you deposited into your personal account and would move over eventually.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 08:31 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 09:21 PM)\nSubject:Business solver\nAttachments:IMG_9707.PNG (293 KB)\nMessage 2033 of 4024\nOMG... I have no idea what this is. Holy crap... what card is this on? Is it my AMEX?\nI need to take a day off the RO & PP and get this stuff sorted out.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 10:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 06:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2034 of 4024\nI don’t think AD and I could have had more fun together. It was freaking amazing. He was so proud of himself for sleeping in the Boy Cave. We\nplayed hoops, saw a movie, played ping pong, and just chilled. It was crazy fun.\nIf Max ever gives it a chance, he will love it. It’s just cheesy guy fun. So I hope your day goes as well! Let me know if you have any tips for the robotics\nevent today. I’d like to go down to Auburn and watch for a little bit.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 05:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 11:50 PM)\nSubject:Have a Great Day",
