It may have been an accident and I’m not mad,\nbut the back and forth on single subjects across two platforms is giving me PTSD. Just want to be sure I understand the protocol, that’s all...\nSent:03/05/2024 at 12:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 12:21 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sambica log in\nMessage 1865 of 4024\nTrying to focus on OFW.\nSent:03/05/2024 at 12:22 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 01:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sambica log in\nMessage 1866 of 4024\nPlease!!!!

I am as frustrated as you. You were saying things that I was not saying. All I ask was which parenting plan and you kept saying I\nwant to talk about the past. I don’t wanna talk about the past.

You said I was doing something I did not do you say it a lot and it frustrates me so I wondered aloud why you always do that. But\nplease don’t do the other thing you always do which is hang up when you hear it.\nPlease log back on. We only have 10 minutes. Please just log back on Christine.
