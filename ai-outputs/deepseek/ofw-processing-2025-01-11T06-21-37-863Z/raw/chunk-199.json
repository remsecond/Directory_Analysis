  "text": "Parenting Plan- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week. <<This has gone on since September. Six times. Since I\ndon't expect you will ever do this at this point, can you at least let me know what your plan is prior to responding?>>\nSpring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\n<<We disagree. I will find mails on OFW discussing this. We can also speak with Dr Brown about our discussion. Either way there are no current\nplans for Spring Break, so I hope we find a peaceful child focused compromise as discussed>>\nDr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like. <<We\nhave. It is in the last email. Do you need me to forward so you can see the next steps that she suggested? I also know you said after reading the internet\nyou would be crafting a new parenting plan instead of Dr. Brown's. Is that your position still?>>\nReturning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous\nnature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely. <<you are talking about 1/3 of the Sonos. I have asked to take a picture\nand give me the other 2/3. I would also just like to grab them as proposed. You have said every week you needed help, it was scheduled. It is never true.\nJust let me do it please. This is low hanging fruit.>>\n3rd Party emails- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week. <<We are on them now and I need to be able to co-parent\neffectively. Please tell me what we're doing so we don not do any further further damage like the whole SAAS situation we teamed up to fix>>\nXfinity- Please provide evidence I will not stop creating the situation months later. Xfinity told me this is an impossible scenario. Please stop\nmonitoring our internet. <<Let's work this out\npeacefully. If your contention is, I am monitoring you when you are the origin of the alerts, we can clear that up pretty quickly. But if you are still\naccusing me of surveilling you, I need to take action, right?>>\nDrop-In- PLEASE UNPLUG THE DEVICES. I have communicated to you on numerous occasions I do not know what is happening and have not\nmade any attempt to drop in on you. <<They are not plugged in. I told you that. You know that. But I can not unplug my phone, so your drop-in\ncalls are still showing there. I have shown you this. You are aware that you still send drop-in requests to audio and video monitoring devices that you\nsent me to use. I show you this. Let's just peacefully resolve as I suggested>>\nAndy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.\nEven under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO? <<I told you that it does not align. You\nknow that well and good. How can we communicate email only if by law you don't let me do that. This is not a mystery. The RO needs to afford for\nus to communicate. You don't allow that.>>\nOFW expectations- OFW will be the platform. <<Why aren't we going with the arrangements that you have signed off on twice as we have talked\nthrough them at great length? We are back here chasing our tails. We need the email options we discussed with 3rd parties, to strategize about 3rd\nparties, communicate with SAAS, Basketball, Robotics, etc... , and we need it to use Andy. If you are intentionally keeping me from effective\nparenting, similar to the SAAS situation, I hope you will reconsider. Please work for a more effective and reasonable solution so we can serve the\nchildren's best interests>>\nThanks Again. Looking forward to a constructive discussion!\nMessage 2163 of 4024\n.\nSent:03/15/2024 at 01:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:I’m on",
