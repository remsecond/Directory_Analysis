I still plan to sell some tomorrow to capture the gains today. Friday’s are typically good for\nthat.\nLet me know if you have any thoughts. I put a lot of time into charts and tracking, but am open to advice.\nSee attached...\nSent:02/29/2024 at 01:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 01:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Fidelity Net Worth\nAttachments:IMG_1708.PNG (331 KB)\nMessage 1729 of 4024\n• Xfinity: I have a couple cable boxes, some things I did not order, etc... I also have all the cameras that you set up years ago. Do you known if they are\nexpecting those back? I was never involved.\n• Sonos: Speakers are pretty scattered but I have several. Do you have any idea how many are still at the house? Some are singles missing their pair. And\nthe ones from the porch might be missing.\nAgain, not urgent but slowly working through things that are stacked in the boxes that fill Max’s room. But also want to be sure to get anything\nreturned for both those areas so we don’t waste any money.\nSent:02/29/2024 at 01:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 01:59 PM)\nSubject:Hardware Questions <not urgent>\nMessage 1730 of 4024\nThank you.
