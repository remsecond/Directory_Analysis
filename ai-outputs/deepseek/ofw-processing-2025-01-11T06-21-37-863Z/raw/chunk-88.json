And it’s not a\ngripe at you at all. He is super excited to have his birthday there.

Tonight is one of those. I know it’s in the past and I have to get used to it, but I’d give anything to be\nable to just talk right now...sorry...\nSent:03/02/2024 at 09:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 06:02 AM)\nSubject:Some Nights...\nMessage 1806 of 4024\nI apologize.

I have looked into for Max and I but can’t till we get the Ok. It’s about an hour. Near your work. And they have all the\nsupplies.\nYou just learn how to do it (it’s like the show we used to watch at Alki) and make some goofy craft (not like the show we watched at Alki... )\nIf you would allow, we could just meet there and take the class. We hardly even need to talk. And it might be fun given how competitive we are with\neach other.\nI’ll do all the legwork and even pick up the tab.\nSent:03/02/2024 at 10:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 06:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Improving our Relationship for Everyone",
