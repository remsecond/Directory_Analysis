  "text": "The other thing I really like is your feeling more comfortable about taking your outside shot ( >10 feet. ) From the baseline is always going to be\ndifficult but it’s something we can work on. It’s a great weapon to have in your bag when you can just nail that.\nI also think it would be super to spend some time in either training clinics or camps soon to work on ball handling. With your Hoops IQ, along with\nbeing smaller and quicker, you’re gonna be most successful at either the one or two slot. So let’s train for that.\nKeep up the great work, Adrian. You’re doing awesome and it’s amazing to watch you grow as a player and a young man every week.\nYou really make me proud.\n-dad\nMessage 2278 of 4024\nNot pointing fingers. I’m trying to co-parent. This one landed after 11:30 pm. So not sure if we need to see if someone is sneaking up past his\nbedtime.\nPlease don’t make me the bad guy. These alerts are doing just what they are supposed to be doing, so parents can be sure kids are playing by the rules.\nAll this shit was set up with good intentions so you and I, as responsible parents could use technology and appearances to protect our family and\nproperty.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 12:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/23/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_2190.PNG (8 MB)\nMessage 2279 of 4024\nWow\nSent:03/23/2024 at 08:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/23/2024 at 06:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Fidelity Net Worth\nAttachments:IMG_2192.PNG (294 KB)\nMessage 2280 of 4024\n?
