Everything falls through the cracks with the RO. I have long documented-\nback to July when we had running list, we will crash and burn. I have mentioned it along the way. I’ve been mentally preparing for it. Maybe like you\nprepared to leave me.\nI have tried recently as you began calling it out. I’m all ears. But we have no platform to resolve. Just let me know what you want to do. Otherwise, I’ll\nsee ya the the poor house. I’m done fighting for what’s right.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:35 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS robotics food\nMessage 1675 of 4024\nI’ll sign up for the second Saturday breakfast.\nYou being employed is a huge factor Robert. You  are willfully unemployed at this time. That term will be raised at mediation I guarantee. Our burn\nis a reflection of when you had a job. Lawyers advice to get a place of equivalent is only relevant if the income in is the same. It is not.\nWe either ratchet down burn or you get a job. The math is simple.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:38 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS robotics food\nMessage 1676 of 4024\nAre you living in the same place, with the same bills? I spent six months in a dump, far away from my kids. I know that’s not 50/50.\nAnd I agree it would be easier to find employment if I had even the slightest idea of when I can see my children. I don’t. That is my number one\npriority. Period.\nYou can say it should be paying for our lifestyle. It’s not. It’s having the family I brought into this world. Sorry...\nHappy to chat, but this is going in circles and you won’t facilitate that.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS robotics food\nMessage 1677 of 4024\nToday is just another day of why we need this. We do it almost every day. You lob grenades at me then ask why I’m not bringing you flowers. What\ndo you think?\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Lay Down Your Sword Please",
