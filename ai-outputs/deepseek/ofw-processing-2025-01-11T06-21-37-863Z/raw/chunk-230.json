  "text": "Message 2262 of 4024\nWhere is the threat?\nI am reaching out to them directly regarding time with the kids. I have not cut them off so it appears there is a misunderstanding. Glad you let me\nknow.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:41 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2263 of 4024\nI didn’t have to let you know, we do it every year, and they had already reached out to us with you on the thread. It should not be a reminder to you.\nGiven that we have 50-50 custody and all decisions are shared, I’m asking that you do not unilaterally reach out, but keep me on the thread since we\nshare decision making. That way we can plan for their visits as coparents rather than you as a single parent.\nPlease respect my legal custody thank you.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 07:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2264 of 4024\nDo whatever you want, Christine. I want you to be happy. But if you reflect on all of my messages today, I have been peaceful and constructive. And I\nprobably asked you about 5-6 times who the therapist is, that said \"only supervised visits\" for the reasons I have outlined several times. It's all crickets\nfrom you.\nSo you repeatedly refuse to answer my question but then start a new thread with this question about the \"five\" and ask over and over so we don't have\nmy ask in the same thread. It's almost like you think I'm either so stupid or have such a small attention span; you can just say \"squirrel,\" and I'll bound\noff like a dog.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 07:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Names of 5 therapists\nMessage 2265 of 4024\nI am asking you to please quit harassing me tonight. Please see below for the way I started the day with you on a positive and constructive note. I even\ncalled you the \"best teammate ever\". That has been reciprocated with non-stop badgering and harassment. Your gaslighting and crazy-making is taking\nan enormous toll on my mental health. I am asking you to stop one last time before I need to escalate. Thanks for your consideration.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 07:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Today",
