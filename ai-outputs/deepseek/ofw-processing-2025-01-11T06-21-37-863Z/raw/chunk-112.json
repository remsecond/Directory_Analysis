Otherwise it’s like today- you make the appointment, make an invite for only yourself, leaving me, unaware of\nimportant meetings we have regarding our kids.\nI would suggest that we do what we have always done instead of trying something new that does not work. I would also recommend a common sense\nrevision to the RO that allows us to resume our family calendar.\nAsks:\n• What single way do we want, to avoid today?\n• Can we revise RO to allow our family calendar?\nSent:03/06/2024 at 11:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 02:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Effective Co-Parenting",
