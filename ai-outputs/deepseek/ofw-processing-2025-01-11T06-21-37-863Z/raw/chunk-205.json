  "text": "Message 2175 of 4024\nI apologize for the start of the conversation. I acknowledge I began expressing my sincere concerns. I've been your soulmate for 28 of our 29 years\ntogether, which is a hard habit to break when I see you this way.\nI did want to connect to discuss the Robotics situation for reasons I mentioned below and did not want to eat up our limited OFW minutes. I agree.\nThat clearly triggered you, and you hung up and refused to reengage.\nI also agree that you told me \"your plans for the activity I signed up for\". Reminiscent of signing up to be our kids' father and telling me your plans to\naccommodate that role in their lives. I don't get a say in anything.\nWhen you started this, our kids were great with me. I have evidence and history of that, and you have admitted as such. You cherry-pick advice you\nwant to leverage like it's canon law and ignore anything else.\nYou know no reunification therapist will touch us because there is no accountability for you, and you still don't let me see the kids 8 months into this.\nYou also caused months to pass before even Kerri Betts could engage.\nSo, while you have chosen to supplant me as the Robotics volunteer and father figure, I had additional questions I wanted to ask so I could play some\nsmall part in their lives. But you would not permit that conversation.\nI knew this was going to be the case because you are as predictable as the tides, so I called several times to find a way to be in Max's life. You did not\nrespond till well after the event (over 21 hours) eliminating that.\nYou found and implemented your own justification for parental alienation as you do daily.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent - Something is wrong with you\nMessage 2176 of 4024\nSend whatever devices you think I am dropping in on you back. I am not and below is an attempt to portray I am. Send anything back now. Stop\nportraying that I do. If you believe I do, remove that from your home immediately.\nWhen Adrian would call me from Alexa, it showed incorrectly as you. That freaked him out.\nThe RO is not false and frivolous. Documenting you are now asserting it is. You had an opportunity to review the RO before it was signed. That box\nwas checked. You signed it.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 01:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List for 3/15\nMessage 2177 of 4024\nI will not engage in any additional phone calls as those are not documented and then you write a narrative portraying as fact which is 100% the\nopposite of what was discussed on the phone.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 12:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 01:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent - Something is wrong with you",
