It’s probably the biggest, most important thing that we could’ve done for our children\noutside of the parenting plan right now. I have to admit I have a little resentment that I’m not able to participate. I don’t want to get into finger-\npointing, but it’s very discouraging that I am not allowed to be part of the discussion.\nSent:03/04/2024 at 02:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 02:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS\nMessage 1832 of 4024\nThe RO allows you to respond with 3rd party.\nThe resentment is strange.

I have not abused that in any way. I\nhave not sent anything mean or condescending at all.\nYour attorney talked you out of constructive communications that in the best interest of our 11-year-old by Friday. Here we are. You noted very\nclearly last week to blame you for it. Ok, I am.\nSent:03/04/2024 at 02:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 02:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS",
