Are Sonos your property. What are you defining as your property.\nGreg I had to reschedule. JV was here but I need to see if he pulled them down.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 10:05 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 10:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2126 of 4024\nBased on the email I’m looking at, I think she has it wrong. It says “opposing counsel needs to confirm”\nSent:03/12/2024 at 10:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2127 of 4024\nIf you could please review the thread below, you will see it is the Sonos that I’ve asked for. It is the only thing I’ve asked for months now.\nIf after a week you still have not checked that JV did the work, I’m not sure how you say you have to climb a ladder and put yourself in danger.\nIMHO, you are now intentionally stoking fires to create conflict with me so I will respond negatively. This is your MO, but I am not biting.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 10:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8",
