  "text": "I don’t want to fight. I just want my family safe. You are free to remove yourself and behave like your single, just as you did before you asked for a\nseparation (no further details required). But taking my kids and alienating me, feels abusive to them.\nI hope you’ll reconsider the advice of professional child advocates instead of the internet advice you have chosen to identity with your position. The\nlast has the time with us as a family (10 meetings) and qualifications to provide personal advice.\nBut this is, without question, a reflection on your true ability to make child focused decisions in Max and Adrian’s best interests. And the alienation,\nwhile I have 50/50 custody, has gone on for nine months now with me getting only a few days with them.\nI think this is bad for Max and Adrian.

You have acknowledged that multiple times. Referencing it as a reason for not following through seems odd.\nThanks for confirming your social agenda is more important and that you refuse to return my personal property after repeated promises to do so.\nThat leads to make the only expensive and unnecessary monetary outlay in my entire hodgepodge of goodwill, CL, and consignment.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 01:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 10:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sonos..\nMessage 2197 of 4024\nYou are always working with someone- five therapist, six plans, nine months.
