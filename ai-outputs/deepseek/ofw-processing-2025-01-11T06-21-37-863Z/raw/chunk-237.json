  "text": "Message 2285 of 4024\nCan we just make time w/o the kids around, tomorrow. The last opportunity you really gave me to chat was months ago when I wanted to salvage our\nmarriage. I’m over that. It does not taint my perspective anymore.\nWhen I heard you today I had serious heartfelt feelings for the woman who I have know for 30 years, gave me three wonderful kids, showed me love\nbetter than I ever deserved, and should not spend another moment with this hate.\nPlease, I’ve asked for months. We don’t need to go couch shopping or glass blowing, but we have to find a way to simply find the humanity in each\nother again. Nothing grander than that. Just recognize each other civilly and respectfully.\nMay we sit together tomorrow? Quietly if need be. We can start with silence and work our way up to kind and constructive questions. You and I can\naccomplish anything in this world we put our mind to. Let’s start with being decent to one another.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 11:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nMessage 2286 of 4024\nWill this help?\nSent:03/23/2024 at 11:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nAttachments:IMG_2211.PNG (8 MB)\nMessage 2287 of 4024\nYes I did.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Purchase...\nMessage 2288 of 4024\nI could be mistaken.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Auction Tonight\nMessage 2289 of 4024\nI am unable to do that given where I am emotionally and mentally with you.
