I am not dropping in on you. If you have devices that allow me to drop in, then change permission settings. I don’t have access and control\nto whatever settings you say I have.

I am not dropping in on you.\n<<Thank you for the reassurance but I don't feel great tbh. I see the attempts, screen capture them, share that instant, and ask about them. Just as I do\nthe constant daily Xfinity alerts that your ISP sends me. As explained before, the devices you used to drop in on me were in active use, going back to\nour Beach days as a family. They were the two cam/audio Alexa devices that we used when we could not find our phones. The Kirkland home\ninitiated these calls from either the Kitchen or your office. Everyone in our family knows this and has used it. This will never be up for debate and the\nkids can both explain it.\nIf you have devices that allow me to drop in, then change permission settings.\n<<I only have these devices because you shipped them to me for my use inside my home instead of in the Kirkland home. I plugged them in and was\nsimply ignorant you sent me audio/video equipment that would allow you that capability. It honestly felt innocent at the time. I can't change your\npermission settings any more than I can change permissions on Xfinity. They are yours. You control them. If it confuses you to understand why\nAmazon would not let anybody take over your audio/video drop-in devices just because they physically have them and then allow this, think about\nwhat that means in nefarious situations.>>\nI don’t have access and control to whatever settings you say I have.\n<<Thank you for the reassurance. I will look again to verify if that is true. I sent you screen captures that say otherwise as recently as last weekend. But\nperhaps you will relinquished that capability this week. That would make me feel better. Note I believe I have unplugged everything you sent me and\nonly see alerts on my phone. I hope that effectively stops the drop-ins from connecting but not the initiation of the attempt. You own those.  You\nrecall how livid you were when our proposed RO was a mutual ask to stop this, but insisted if we asked, you would move forward with a DV charges\nagainst me so we could not>>\nIf you are insisting I do that, let’s have a third party review my phone records to determine if I am in fact doing that.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 12:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List for 3/15",
