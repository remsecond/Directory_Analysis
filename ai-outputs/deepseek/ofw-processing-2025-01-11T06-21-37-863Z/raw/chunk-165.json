If you choose to go directly against Dr. Brown’s recommendation based on talking to\nus both and Adrian that’s your choice. But it definitely is not the kids best interest. I am not trying to manipulate you at all. I’m trying to have an\nhonest discussion in Goodwill. That’s not manipulation.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 02:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 02:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2079 of 4024\nThen that is what you will see.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 02:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 02:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2080 of 4024\nPlease for once in this whole process stick to your word. And even if it’s not accepting the plan. Stick to your word that we would talk about it so we\ncan discuss it between ourselves before we spend $10,000 for our lawyers to solve something rephrasing what we’re trying to say that we could just say\nto each other.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 02:54 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2081 of 4024\nIt is impossible for me to see what Dr. Brown said when you say you’re pressing charges. She said flat out that is not in our children’s best interest.\nYou said very clearly below you are doing that. The two can’t happen concurrently. And, I told you very clearly that I would send you a parenting\nplan that mirrors, Dr. Brown. If it does not, I am open to changing it. If that was somehow incorrect in its interpretation, I am more than happy to\nchange that but we don’t need $10,000 spent on lawyers to do something. I am already telling you I will do.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 02:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver",
