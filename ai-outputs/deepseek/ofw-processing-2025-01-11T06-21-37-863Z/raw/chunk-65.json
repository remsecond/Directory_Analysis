  "text": "Message 1731 of 4024\nI am trying to be very unemotional but still factual about my disappointment.\nThe RO is not what we agreed on despite the agreement below. This costs thousands of dollars. It would save us money to just say \"no\" rather than\nsay \"Agree to RO updates\" and then not.\nPlease advise if you and Annalisa are not planning to go with what we agreed to, and I'll decide how to proceed. After the explicit \"what if\" detailed\nexplanations for the changes this is frustrating.\nI'll be blunt. This sucks. Last time you said \"I'm in control\" so I assume you are. Disappointing\nSent:02/29/2024 at 02:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 03:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Round II: RO Updates\nMessage 1732 of 4024\nHey-\nI see our lawyers are burning money trying to figure out what you want. What you and I agreed to vs what Annalisa sent. Her response is pretty coy\nand does not  offering any explanation for the mismatch.\nI really would not be bugging you because I have enjoyed the “peace and the pace” we have been using the last few days. But in this case we are\nspending real tuition money trying to mind read.\nAny thoughts how we can stop the billing?\nThanks!\nSent:02/29/2024 at 04:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 04:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Round II: RO Updates\nMessage 1733 of 4024\nShe and I went over today and what was sent back reflects our discussion.\nThe RO continues to include the language for management of shared finances.\nThe language for physical threats was removed.\nFor OFW we added the emergency calls option. After further discussion, the other exception would likely be covered under emergency.\nFirst email, added FYI. The other exception basically would open up all email.\nYou also saw that we sent proposed mediation dates for Summer.\nSent:02/29/2024 at 04:43 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 04:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Round II: RO Updates",
