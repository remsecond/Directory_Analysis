I\nwish you well, Christine. I am really trying.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 09:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: What are you doing?\nMessage 1668 of 4024\nThanks for the feedback. I am going to wait to reply to this in the hope that we can find a constructive resolution. Thank you!\nSent:02/26/2024 at 10:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1669 of 4024\nI’ll forward you the email I’m copy and pasting from below. We did as agreed except you kept the guest bedroom.\nYou also never had less than three working TVs on the house at all times- Master, Man Cave, AD’s room for three people.\nI moved TVs. I also had everything I owned put into trash bags. Tens of them, plus garbage. That was hard on me too.\nAs mentioned, just tell me what to send back I shouldn’t have taken. I’ll also help you find a cat room couch replacement.\nHave a great day!\nBest\nrobert",
