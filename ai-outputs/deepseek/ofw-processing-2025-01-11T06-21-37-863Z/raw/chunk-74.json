  "text": "Message 1753 of 4024\nSorry, trying to understand what you are saying. And I honestly do want to be sympathetic to your asks.\n• Is that step away for just tonight?\n•  Are we going to discuss tomorrow?\n• Should I just ignore the current RO?\n• Do stop doing what we already do?\n• Should we just keep paying lawyers?\n• Today didn’t work, even though it did?\nI know you feel pressured. So I will stop. But in this moment, please understand what it is like for me to deal with you. It’s taken weeks. Every\nagreement is disregarded. They are honestly worthless now.\nAnd then you complain about my reaction. But please for a moment put yourself in my shoes and think about how you would feel if I did that to you\nover and over for weeks and weeks with nothing to show.\nI’m not harping on you. But you asked for examples of “how I poke at you”. This is how. We finally communicate like adults, reach an agreement,\nand then it all falls apart. It would frustrate anyone.\nI’m not going to bitch at you but I’m not sure how you want me to respond when you filed a public RO saying I will beat you and the kids, and won’\nt approve what we already do today. After you agreed to it?\n• You feel pressured.\n• I feel mislead, again.\nNow how do we resolve in a constructive way w/o communicating with each other? It’s an endless loop.\nPlease consider what I am saying, Christine.\nGood luck tomorrow I know it will be a tough day. I’ll sell some stock. Best wishes and sweet dreams.\n• robert\nSent:02/29/2024 at 09:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 07:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Can we close?\nMessage 1754 of 4024\nAnother alert. Well past his bedtime. I guess since I got this that means I am monitoring you and surveilling the kids again. Never stops, huh?\nEverything about your selective acceptance of how this all works to suit your own narrative is too much now. Believe whatever makes you feel better.\nThe fact is you don’t know why I still get these two months after you took over no more than you can say you know I didn’t the night in question.\nNever has so much damage been done with so much unsolved, unexplained, and demonstrably false evidence available. I know, you’ll stop it this\nweek.\nSent:02/29/2024 at 10:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 07:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_1718.PNG (8 MB)",
