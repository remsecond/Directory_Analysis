  "text": "Message 1795 of 4024\nRobert, I don’t have the same luxury of time to pull together emails such as below.\nThen the expectation  is I read every word, pull out something for a response that is embedded with.\nYou send me multiple emails and expect a back and forth. I can’t do that.\nMy days are one work, errand to another. I know that bothers you.\nYour excuse for not having a job is that it will require you to put a full days work in and can’t devote to nothing else. That is the reality that majority\nof humans deal with.\nI don’t see any outstanding issues at this time that need me to be in this platform for the next few hours, so yes I am going to pivot to chores I can’t get\ndone during a working week PLUS work.\nSent:03/02/2024 at 09:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 10:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Are you done?\nMessage 1796 of 4024\nThanks!\nThat is not my expectation. My expectation is that if we are solving an issue, we either do that or you let me know you are stepping away. Just\ncuriosity.\n•  I assume we kill the basketball idea I had for AD\n• I hoped to reach an agreement on Sonos for today\nI don’t know either. They both seem to need an answer so I can plan.\nThe suggestions for Dr Brown improving us can wait but are important.\nAbout the whole job thing, I know you mentioned that a lot, and don’t understand why I don’t do the same thing you do.\nI think the easiest explanation is a simple recognition of what is going on. I had my whole life turned upside down on July 5. I found out you were\nfooling around with a married man who works for you. I soon had my kids taken, my house taken, and then a restraining orders put on me that say I\nbeat you and my kids.\nSo think of it this way. You launched an unexpected attack on a neighboring country-me. You bomb me day and night. I thought we were at peace,\nallies. We are not now in a covert move. So you go about your business. Your attack was planned. I alternatively am fighting for my life to understand\nwhat my future is.\nIt’s a pretty accurate metaphor. Does that help?\nSent:03/02/2024 at 10:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 10:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Are you done?",
