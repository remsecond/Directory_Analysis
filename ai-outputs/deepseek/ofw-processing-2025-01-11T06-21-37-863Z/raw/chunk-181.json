It can all come through four degrees of separation but it’s going to cost us a fortune and be less\neffective.\nV -> Annalisa -> Lisa -> robert\nI really hope for the kids and our sake we can rein this in. No one would believe what we have come to. We were so good together it’s just impossible\nto think of.\nI assure you I will respond in kind and be kind and respectful. If we can give each other credit for having our own perspective and look forward, not\nback as Dr Brown asked, it’ll make all the difference in the world.\nPlease let me know, Christine and I will respect your wishes.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 04:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: $$$ Today $$$",
