It was my fault. Where is the argument? Take the win.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 01:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Urgent - Something is wrong with you\nMessage 2179 of 4024\nSending you a device that you sent to me that is not plugged in does not stop this. You have to understand I know you are not in my house, plugging\nthem in and calling me from a secret location. I can explain what’s happening again if you still don’t understand this. It’s really easy. I don’t mind.\nThere is no need to fight. Document what you like.\n• You and or your legal counsel did file the wrong RO on me: documented\n• You acknowledge you didn’t approve the physical abuse claim- documented.\nLet’s please stop fighting! Let’s please work together. I have never come after you for ANYTHING! If I have, please let me know how to rectify. I\ndon’t want to do that if I have in any way whatsoever. I assure you.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 01:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Running List for 3/15\nMessage 2180 of 4024\nA simple, brief, clarifying phone call where tempers are measured long enough to separate the signal from the noise works wonders! We can stop the\nmadness of OFW if we so choose.\nWe just need a calm moment now and then to be sure each other understands what the other is really saying rather than assuming we know what they\nare saying. It really does work, Christine.\nPlease consider affording us that on occasion. I’d even say when we see something we might consider to be inflammatory, maybe we stop OFW before\nit gets worse and have a clarifying chat.\nWe really can take this back and work together.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 01:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 05:12 PM)\nSubject:Thank You",
