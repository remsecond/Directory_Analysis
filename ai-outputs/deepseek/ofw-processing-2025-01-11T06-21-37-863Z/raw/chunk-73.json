  "text": "The two things we need to have are:\n• What we did today with the Sambica camp. We had a forward, a couple questions and that was it. If you think I will abuse it, look at what we did\ntoday. It was not even allowed and I did not abuse it. Please allow that just like we effectively used today.\n• A better way to accommodate urgent situations. I had no idea where the tryouts were. I sent you an OFW and said it was urgent. You still did not\ncheck until well after I would have needed to leave. I don’t want to get AD involved in that. We should not. But only the email solved it. Again, not\nallowed.\nBoth are perfect examples of what we need. And we did both today with great success. So we have a proven track record. After a month of this and a\nfull day tomorrow before you have to rinse and repeat next week, may we please allow what we are already doing? It wasn’t and won’t be abused.\nI apologize again for the frustration. It arises from our inability to communicate. If we could just start that again with this baby step, it will go a long\nway.\nPlease just call for five minutes on platform if you would like to discuss. Let’s team up here!\nMessage 1750 of 4024\nAny thoughts?\nCan we please wrap before you move on to other things again?\nSent:02/29/2024 at 08:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 09:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can we close?\nMessage 1751 of 4024\nI feel uncomfortable because boundaries are blurred with those conditions.\nThe safeguards are in place and I know my mental state has vastly improved as a result.\nI am feeling pressured right now and need to step away.\nSent:02/29/2024 at 09:05 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/29/2024 at 09:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can we close?\nMessage 1752 of 4024\nOk... so don’t sign it?\nSent:02/29/2024 at 09:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 07:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Can we close?",
