Remember, we were going to try and time it so\nyou were out of town, but you killed that. And of course we see The Moyers every year. Both Michael and Robyn and Beth are regular visits. We\nalways go visit our extended family.\nSo given that you took the boys to go visit your whole family and then made a decision to divorce me after talking to your mom, when do the boys get\nto see my side of the family? Obviously, if it requires you, that’s fine. I took your whole family to Whistler and had an amazing time. It works great!\nGiven we both are really trying to work hard to make sure the boys have the best and most supportive family experience, but they have been utterly\ncut off from my family while I’ve enabled yours, please build that into the parenting plan.\nThanks again!!!\nSent:03/21/2024 at 07:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2259 of 4024\nI’ll have my lawyer request.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Names of 5 therapists\nMessage 2260 of 4024\nI’m puzzled by this.\nIs the implication I cut them off?\nHave they been made aware of your situation, and your relationship with Max and Adrian?\nI can reach out directly to them.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2261 of 4024\nIs that a threat?\nSent:03/21/2024 at 09:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word",
