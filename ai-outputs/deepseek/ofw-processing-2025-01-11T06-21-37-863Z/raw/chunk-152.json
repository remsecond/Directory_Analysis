I paid the overdue balance we had for AAU (there was a screenshot of it) with unemployment money. I’ll attach it again. There is no\n“unemployment overdue item”. The overdue item is in the screenshot. It’s AAU as I said. And I paid it off with unemployment money.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 04:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 05:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nAttachments:IMG_1855.PNG (142 KB)\nMessage 2027 of 4024\nThank you\nSent:03/09/2024 at 05:19 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 05:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\nMessage 2028 of 4024\nDid you not answer this yes\nor no question on purpose?\nI think we are up to around\n15 replies now.
