And you are acting as the go-between for altering times with Adrain when you knew we had confirmed plans already.\nThey could also very well be in the boy cave I spent weeks and $$$ building for them, exactly for the sole purpose of \"Movie Marathons\" over here.\nWhat would you propose as the best way for us to handle these situations together now that they have been created and will be very tough to unwind?\nIt's my time, and I have the perfect place. If you want them to have a good relationship with their father, I would hope you advocate for that instead\nof this.\nI don't care about the Parenting Plan violation, but I do want to get this right. I just resent the note about reunifying Max earlier. We talked about it\nyesterday.\nAre you going to foster and help enable a healthy and positive relationship between our children and me, or do you feel like this is a better course of\naction?\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 1970 of 4024\nI asked Adrian and he was surprised for lunch pick up. I thought you aligned with him.\n3pm was his ask.\nWe are navigating so I would appreciate if tone were moderated.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:17 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian",
