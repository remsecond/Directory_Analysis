  "text": "accomplished last week knocking out issues we  were suoerbcontentions just with anncouple two minute phone calls. Unfortunately sadly success is\nnot your metric Now for the rest of the month, we will double down on your plan to make things even worse for our children with no more class.\nWell played!\nAnd the cherry on top you sent me the AAA cards to a platform that you know I’m not allowed to use and somehow expected me to understand that’\ns where they would be waiting so I spent hours on a busy bridge where you were why you played mindngames . I honestly do hope you find someone\nwho would put up with you the way that I did. I’m confident they will for a few years.

Perhaps a dinnjng Kruger variations I don’t know if it’s actually a clinical diagnosis and I won’t\npresuppose to guess at it, but if it puts your head on the pillow at night with satisfaction, more power to you\nP.S.. don’t read about what a narcissist diagnosis is.\nMessage 2212 of 4024\nThe cherry on top is I. Am freezing my ball sack and\nFingers to the to bone because you refuse to lift even so much as a finger to help me out, save money and keep me standing in the freezing conditions\njust to demonstrate how much you fucking hate my.
