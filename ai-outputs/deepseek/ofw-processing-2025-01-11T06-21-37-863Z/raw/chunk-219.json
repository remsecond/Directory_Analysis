Cheap, goofy, immature things that would show you I care, and wanted to\nkeep things special for you while you stayed cozy in bed and I walked Harry. Hoping to return to my dozy queen, with hot fresh coffee, chilled\nberries, and sleep in her beautiful brown eyes ready not snuggle toes .\nI lived to spoil you. To see your sleepy smile, and hear you “why are you always so sweet to me” . We grew apart of course, but we made a solum vow\nthat we agreed meant we would live a life with a glass half full till our lemonade overflowed again. Life’s full of peaks and valleys, our true character is\nhow we handle each.\nI miss seeing you on my pedestal. Just like your name emblazoned on my body, no one else belongs there.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 06:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 07:01 AM)\nSubject:I still do stupid things..\nAttachments:IMG_2067.MOV (59 MB)\nMessage 2216 of 4024\nSee what you sent me earlier. Mission accomplished email.\nYour anger and hatred to me is scary.\nPlease stop these emails.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 07:06 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 07:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..\nMessage 2217 of 4024\nI know. You don’t understand that when you poke me it hurts. And I respond. Or that i can still love you despite those pokes.\nNo married life is perfect, it comes with ups and downs. Successful couples navigate them with honesty instead of lies.\nJust be authentic for once. Life is not all. Pink clouds and roses. But when we do get those chances we damn sure should cherish them.\nSent:03/19/2024 at 07:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 08:33 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..\nMessage 2218 of 4024\nI’d love a time boxed two minutes to show some some non-violent cooperation today ?\nSent:03/19/2024 at 07:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 08:33 AM)\nSubject:Peace Pipe?",
