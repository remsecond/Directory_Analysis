  "text": "Message 2128 of 4024\nWhen we pay for Adrian it will require from bank account that has cash and not a credit card.\nWe will have tuition, study skills and bus.\nI saw the fidelity account has about 15k, so I could link it to that account.\nBofA only has 4k, which we will need for expenses. Mortgage will also be due soon. My next paycheck is end of week.\nI’ll look at credit card totals this week to see what is outstanding.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:06 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:06 AM)\nSubject:SAAS tuition/Bills\nMessage 2129 of 4024\nSuper! Thanks for the fast attention on this\nFor SAAS, can’t we do the same as for Max?\nWhat’s our BofA number? Happy to move more.\nWe should probably look at 5-10x for legal too.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS tuition/Bills\nMessage 2130 of 4024\nJV did not pull the Sonos down from outside like I asked. I am uncertain why he did not as he had the ladder up.\nI did ask him to check the dripping from deck which he caulked, but likely forgot.\nI’ll pull the ladder up perhaps on Saturday after robotics.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:10 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2131 of 4024\nYes, same process that you have been moving money to BofA from fidelity. If you need those numbers again I can send them.\nI have not seen tuition bills yet and will ask today. I’m asking in anticipation.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:14 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS tuition/Bills",
