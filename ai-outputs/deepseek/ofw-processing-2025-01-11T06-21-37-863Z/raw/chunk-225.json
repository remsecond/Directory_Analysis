The minutes are gone because you used them in unnecessary calls including using unneeded mins on calls after I said we needed to\nhang up, and you refused.\nI see a tactic where you deliberately use the mins up to justify switching to other means.\nI suggest you discuss with your lawyer on solutions.\nSent:03/20/2024 at 10:13 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/20/2024 at 10:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Emergencies\nMessage 2243 of 4024\nIt’s ok. I just thought we would want a solution just in case. He was freaked out, but I’m sure we will be fine. I’m not fighting with you or finger\npointing. Have a great night. Honestly! Really hope we find a way to heal in some way in the future.

Hope that you can understand my confusion around the “side conversation” policy given Dr. Brown’s advice\nthat it is strictly prohibited. Again, maybe that’s just a difference in perspectives we have certainly had a few of those.\nAny way, have an awesome day! We are both on the kids side and I could not ask for a better teammate in that endeavor.\n• robert\nSent:03/21/2024 at 11:00 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 11:05 AM)\nSubject:Today\nMessage 2245 of 4024\nWho are the 5 therapists?\nSent:03/21/2024 at 11:07 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 11:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Today",
