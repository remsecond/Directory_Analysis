The actual written and documented history, serves no purpose in your narrative. Agree, when truth does not\nmatter, let’s move on. I’d rather be happy than correct.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:14 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1672 of 4024\nLet’s try it for a day or two. I don’t know why things got worse after Dr Brown but they have. Much worse for that matter. You hate me for\neverything little thing I do. Rage burns in your eyes in a flash. I’m sorry Inget frustrated by that, but I just don’t see it as something that is healthy or\nsustainable.\nWe can’t live that way and grow healthy young men. I asked last night for your solution. I have asked her several times. Fully committed to any means\nyou suggest to find peace. I have offered many different scenarios you don’t agree with. Please offer one that you do, and I will gladly comply.\nChrist, Christine, it stupid to even repeat your off quoted “definition of insanity” to you again. Even doing that at this point meets the defining\ncriteria.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:25 AM)\nSubject:Lay Down Your Sword Please\nMessage 1673 of 4024\nI am happy to sign up for breakfast on a Saturday but will confirm that is actually an option and not both lunch and breakfast.\nI will say I am concerned about finances. It appears you are not as concerned about run rates or getting reimbursed for things so perhaps I am being\ntoo conservative. Just lmk.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 07:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:25 AM)\nSubject:SAAS robotics food",
