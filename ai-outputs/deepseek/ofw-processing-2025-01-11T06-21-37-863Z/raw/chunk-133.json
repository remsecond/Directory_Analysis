  "text": "The dysfunction in relationship with Max  is not my doing and hope you work to resolve.\nMessage 1971 of 4024\nThis is a very disappointing response\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 1972 of 4024\nWhen I asked you yesterday for plan you responded I’ll connect with him and coordinate directly. I trusted you to do that. Adrian was not aware of\nplan and clearly did not know. Why is that on me?\nNext time I will be clear with Adrian and not leave up in the air.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:23 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 1973 of 4024\nSee below. Adrian and I chatted. We talked about the entire day. I even gave you details of what he was doing now so you had to know we chatted.\nWe did have a time- it was noon. For you to say “I thought you talked with him” is frustrating, because I did. And then I told you I did. And then I\ntold you the results of that discussion. Please see below.\nOptions:\nAdrian lied to you and said we did not chat\nYou decided I lied below and did not chat\nI told you I would coordinate with him. I did coordinate with him. And then you decided I did not and stepped into the middle of it.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:24 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1974 of 4024\nSee mail from earlier this AM where I go into great detail about my coordination with Adrian this AM\nSee other email about working together with Max so he has a strong father figure in his life.\nSomething really changed in you that you would work to destroy and blame instead of heal.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian",
