  "text": "I am willing to work with you so hope you see that in that spirit.\nYou also had kids spending spring break with you this year.\nI haven’t paid much attention to the financial side but now that we are close to finalizing PP, it is a natural progression of next steps.\nWe probably have a different opinion of what future spousal support looks like. Child payments are just a formula.\nI haven’t taken time to pull together documents for asset split or spousal but am just starting to think about it.\nMessage 2055 of 4024\nI wasn’t expecting you to stick to the agreement you made. And I asked you very clearly if I could just send it to you before Lisa but you balked. Not\nsure why since now we have wasted days and may be at in impasse again for no reason.\nAnd of course now that me actually having permission to see the kids I have 50/50 custody of is going to be legalized you would shift to how I pay for\nyour lifestyle as I have done for all these years. Nothing in this whole thing surprises me.\nActually, Kevin did surprise me.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 11:10 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 11:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2056 of 4024\nI realize now in our 1:1 setting, I feel anxious and get pushed to agreeing to things. I ask not to do them and communicate that. I try to wrap the\nconversation or discussion as quickly as possible. Once in calmer environment, without your influence, I am able to think clearly.\nIf there are situations that require limitations, as in our case, it is not 50/50. That is why we are negotiating this PP.\nBringing up Kevin is disappointing. I have avoided responding and addressing when you have brought up on numerous occasions in the past, but will\naddress for one last time.\nReference to Kevin is harassment and disturbance of the peace in violation of the RO. RO states communications are limited to co parenting or\nshared assets.\nGiven the space of 8 months to reflect on what happened, I disagree with the characterization of an affair. That is not a fact. You made me agree to\nsomething after months of yelling and your view of what happened. I did not disclose the picture to you when asked, but that does mean it was an\naffair. I would characterize it as a friendly interaction.\nI don’t consider that issue as something that relates to our co parenting or shared assets. And will not engage in that discussion any further. If you\nchoose to do so, you know my perspective on that topic and intersection with RO.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 12:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 12:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver",
