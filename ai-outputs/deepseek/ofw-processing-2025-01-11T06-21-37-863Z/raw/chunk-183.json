Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2120 of 4024\nI realize that you went back on everything you said in this thread, but am I at least going to get this property back I’ve asked for since the start of Jan?\nI appreciate the bags of garbage you sent instead as a funny joke. It was hilarious, but I’ve been trying to get these for months now so it’s loosing its\nhumor.\nYou’ll always say you are making progress, but still don’t give them to me. Just unplug the ones in use and give me the sub still in the box. It’s so easy.\nPlease let me have my own property back.\nThanks!\nSent:03/11/2024 at 11:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 07:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.

It is dangerous for me.\nI will schedule a lugg to transport remaining items in computer closet and garage.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 07:10 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 08:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2122 of 4024\nYou said that that the work was being done by Greg, then JV. If you really arranged neither, I don’t expect you to put yourself in danger for the two\non the back porch. I did, however, say that if you took a picture and then brought me the sub in the mailbox Sonos, that would be very helpful.\nI have repeatedly said do not send anymore things to my place that are in the garage or the IT closet I can find mails for you. Until we settle the house,\nit is not yours. So don’t continue to trash my place by sending things here when we have storage in a garage I don’t have. Please stop the threats.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 08:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8",
