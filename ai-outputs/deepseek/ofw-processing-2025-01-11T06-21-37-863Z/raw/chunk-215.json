You have no idea what I’m calling about. Are you so clairvoyant that you read my mind now? Urgent situations and emergencies\nare not planned despite your repeated contention that they are on the calendar at a specific date and time.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 04:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 10:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thank You\nMessage 2202 of 4024\nI am making it clear it is\nSent:03/17/2024 at 04:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 10:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thank You\nMessage 2203 of 4024\nMore Xfinity imagination. I assume AD didn’t get home early from skiing today and the sat in front of the computer while mom did her thing. Her\nthing so important that she wouldn’t answer an urgent or emergency call. Hope your St Patti’s date is worth it.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 05:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 10:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_2040.PNG (3 MB)\nMessage 2204 of 4024\nOk... the KU vs Gonzaga round of 32 next Saturday is now sold out. That is a March Madness dream matchup that I would assume Casey and Elsa\nwould also want to go to. But either way it’s better than the Super Bowl for me and Adrian to see in person.\nIt’s not an emergency, but was certainly urgent. Once brackets drop, you don’t get another chance. We had the time of our life in Cabo watching\nthem win the national championship. A top memory we will share as a special father son moment for a lifetime.\nNot sure when this kind of opportunity will ever happen again for us, but you viscously stole it. You did that to Adrian. You took something amazing\nwe share together away from him. No judge would ever say he should not have that lifetime experience.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 07:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 10:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thank You",
