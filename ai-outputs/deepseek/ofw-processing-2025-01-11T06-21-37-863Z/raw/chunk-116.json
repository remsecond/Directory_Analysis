It was clear that was never going to work once your behaviour started to spiral out of control making the family\nfeel unsafe.\nThat model I now see would not work if there is DV or history of substance abuse or emotional disregulation.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 08:53 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 09:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1923 of 4024\nHow is your way working?\nWas the family better the night I drove home at 10:00!not to miss a single moment in your arms before we made love four times before you left...  or\ntoday?\nYou want an excuse for lying about everything. Kevin, Yurushka, Cabo Crew, Elsa, Max, etc... But those were all your lies and your decisions to spin\nthem.\nWe could have continued on our path of healing. We had charted a course you assured me you supported.\nYou talked to your mom and nuked our family.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 09:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 09:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1924 of 4024\nThis email is inappropriate.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 09:08 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 09:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Andy",
