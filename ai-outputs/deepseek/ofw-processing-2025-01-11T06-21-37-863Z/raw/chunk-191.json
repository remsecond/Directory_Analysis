  "text": "What i have been trying to do since the divorce filing was reach agreement with you in a way that minimized involvement of 3rd parties, but structure\nan agreement that demonstrated the seriousness of what transpired and what needs to happen to move forward to provide safety for all.\nAfter your outburst on Sunday, and continuing demand I file charges, and lack of true accountability, I stepped back and reevaluated the totality of\nwhat transpired in the relationship and your continuing behavior to me. While I have been focused on substance abuse and protecting against that, as\nthat is what I recognized and was familiar with, the domestic violence aspect experienced by kids and I was truly never acknowledged. I have done\nextensive reading on this subject now and how PP should be structured.\nI now realize that my approach was wrong, and my initial efforts were actually short sighted, as it did not set up a plan for long term healing and\npotential positive outcomes.\nI will have my lawyer reach out to yours to provide our thoughts on next steps.\nMessage 2142 of 4024\nThanks for the amazing period leading up till July 5th. It was magic. I truly felt we were one, and on a trajectory for a happy lifetime as soulmates.\nI will always have those magic memories of the best our family ever was, reaching for the stars to achieve even more together, as one happy family.\nI’ll always cherish when we knew we finally got it right.\nBest wishes my Queen. You were, and forever will be.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/13/2024 at 09:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Local Hoops\nMessage 2143 of 4024\nShould we chat?\nIt feels like we’ve veered so far off track that finding our way back seems almost impossible. Our love once blazed as brightly as the stars, but that same\nenergy now powers a relentless cycle of hate and disdain.\nEvery week, I suggest trying something new, anything to help us see the good in each other again and build a life our boys would be proud to emulate.\nI’ve been pushing for us to keep things civil, and you say you are tired of the endless fighting. Yet, somehow, things keep spiraling every day, with each\nof us only seeing perspectives from our POV.\nWe both know this isn’t working, and no therapist would disagree. What do you say we take a moment, step back from the chaos on the dancefloor,\nand look at where we are from the balcony?\nMaybe it’s time to consider healthier paths, anything different from the mess we are in now. Every week, we agree this does not work. Every week we\nstill find common ground. Then every week we abandon that and fight even harder. I'd like to discuss this with a cooler head if you would.\nThanks!\nSent:03/13/2024 at 01:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/13/2024 at 03:46 PM)\nSubject:The Future",
