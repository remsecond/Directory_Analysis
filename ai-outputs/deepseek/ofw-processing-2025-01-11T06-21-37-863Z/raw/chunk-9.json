We both know you told me you did not tell anybody especially the Cabo crew, but you did. That means you’\nre a liar.\nThis is also very much related to our children. It was in the plan that you never adopted so I don’t know how child related things are violation of the\nRO.\nWe know this format does not work and only further inflames things and make us hate. But it is your choice to continue this way rather than be\npeaceful and civil.\nIt’s funny that the woman who quoted the definition of insanity to me over and over for years doesn’t recognize that now.

I want to get along with you again. This is a difficult time for us and we are only making it worse this way,\nnot being able to just clear the air and ask simple questions, has us resorting to lobbing hang grenades at each other. I ask you for a simple five minutes\nand you reject it at every turn. This honestly is not working. I implore you to please consider another way. What is the harm in just trying at Christine\nSent:02/22/2024 at 09:00 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 09:01 AM)\nSubject:I meant what I said\nMessage 1547 of 4024\nThoughts? Will you consider smoking the peace pipe? I’ve asked for weeks now. Isn’t it worth a try. If it goes sideways we obviously can come back to\nthis hell. But if it works we can change this entire dynamic.\nSent:02/22/2024 at 09:09 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 10:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: I meant what I said\nMessage 1548 of 4024\nIt is not safe.\nSent:02/22/2024 at 09:14 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 09:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: I meant what I said",
