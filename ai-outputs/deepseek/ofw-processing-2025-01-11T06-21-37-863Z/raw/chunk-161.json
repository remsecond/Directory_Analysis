I don’t see any issues with what you are\nasking and are similar to what I would propose.\nBut when you start the discussion in such a counterproductive way asserting your omnipotence, it’s a bad tact. Do you want to think about treating\nme as an equal and not someone who works for you?\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 01:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2065 of 4024\nI know it happened on your watch. We were doing great before you said that you all would be divorcing me. You made it acceptable to not tell the\ntruth and treat me like a monster. He imitates what he sees.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 01:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics\nMessage 2066 of 4024\nWow. I was trying to be helpful.\nYou are accusing me of influencing him.\nI’m going to stop this conversation.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:21 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 01:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics\nMessage 2067 of 4024\nI appreciate the POV. But please climb down off your highnhorse long enough to read what I said and let me know if it is incorrect.\nAs mentioned before, we will have a much better relationship if when he imitates what he sees, it’s not vilification. That is all he sees now.\nI’d like to work on that with you. Make sense?\nThat’s why I’m trying to find a way to be friendly\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 02:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max/Robotics",
