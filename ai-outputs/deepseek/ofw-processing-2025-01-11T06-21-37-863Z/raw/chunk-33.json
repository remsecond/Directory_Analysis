  "text": "Dr Brown was clear that in her opinion OFW should be the forum we use given the history. I am open to OFW calls for emergencies.\nOne week is not long enough to show a demonstrated ability to address my concerns and real fears for safety. You have continued to downplay the\nimpact 25 years of aggression and coercion has had on me. Even in person the level of aggression and anger is palpable.\nNot having texts/calls have been such a huge relief to me.\nThe emails with 3rd party and fyi make sense to me.\nI also need to address the pictures you brought up. The language you used to highlight you had them was scary and threatening to me. The specificity\nof referencing details in the pictures was shocking, to drive home the point. It was the same type of language you used with the boys. It’s alarming and\nused to scare. I do not believe they have been destroyed and fear they will be used as retribution in the future.\nMessage 1627 of 4024\nThank you! I really appreciate the response and will not push you for anything you are not comfortable with. This is a great start. And I am happy to\nprove this will work. I hope we share a desire to get back to normalcy with a track record.\nI don’t have a way to downplay or even discuss the 25 years. I have asked to learn more about your feelings but you refuse. I have apologized and asked\nfor feedback on what to change but we never can talk about it. I’d like to please.\nThe pictures are gone. That was sacred intimacy that we shared. There are a whole host of things you and I did together as soulmates that is no one’s\nbusiness ever. The things we discussed and trusted with one another is ours and ours only.\nI brought it up because you said you would’ve remembered the cam purchase (which we did, and you sent) because you remember big things. This\nalso was a big thing. It was only to illustrate you don’t remember, but you still swear you do.\nChristine, please write whatever you want up. I’m happy to agree. No issues. We started having orgies with the two Filipina girls in Hong Kong when\nyou were only 18. There is a long list of others and sex clubs since. That is only our business.\nI don’t think you get it. I love you. You were my soulmate. I promised till death do us part. If you told me now, how to fix this today, I would. That’s\nwhat a real marriage is. I would never in my worst nightmare want to intentionally hurt you in any way.\nI will go to my grave honoring my vow to love, honor, and cherish you, and all we made together and held so dear for three decades. Holding each\nother’s hearts and hands in safe protection from the world at large. That was our vow. I’m not going to quit.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1628 of 4024\nWhy would you bring up things like that and put in email and word form?? Why? Like really why? I swear you do it to torment and document on\nthis platform. It’s a pattern for you. It only goes to traumatize.\nShould I shell out all the deprived and crazy things you did in very very specific detail? Should I? Would you like that or would that be traumatizing?\nIn very specific detail?\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:30 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
