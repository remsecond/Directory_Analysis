  "text": "Message 1615 of 4024\nSo.... I don’t want to inflame things. That is not my intention. Especially during our “prove it week”\nAs you will see however, almost a month ago I brought up suggestions to improve both our working relationship and co-parenting effectiveness.\nYou said:\nLet Anna Lisa know that I don’t beat my kids and you saying it is probably inappropriate. Seems like she, as your lawyer, would tell you that too, but\nwhatever.\nI should propose a more appropriate form of communication to help us, but be cognizant of your sincere and justified concerns. So I did in detail.\nWe were on path to improve everything for a full week until you met with Anna Lisa and it went “poof” up in smoke. No change whatsoever. Back to\nthis.\nThe next week we were doing well, but you asked for patience daily and even thanked me for affording you that. Till the next Friday again. And then\n“Poof”\nYou get mad that my frustration manifests here. I am letting you know when you say “yes” and actions show “no” it makes things worse for this\nsituation.\nYou say “you have to prove it first” while you poke me week after week. And get upset by my response to your contradictory behavior. It’s super\nfrustrating.\nSo despite you agreeing and then ignoring exactly what you asked me to do, I’m going to try one last time to break our catch-22 and make progress.\nI’d like to share my thoughts ahead of time in an effort to take this back and as Dr Brown loosely said, “agree to disagree, quit fighting, and focus on\nthe future.”\nEvery mental health professional has had awful, awful thoughts on divorce lawyers. Can you and I hammer out what “WE” believe is best for our kids\nhere?\nI’ll share, please block 10 minutes this weekend to review. And let me know how we move it forward.\nBest\n• robert\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1616 of 4024\nOk. Just note I’m on the mountain with Dylan and Adrian. I won’t log in to either account until early evening when with my computer.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:40 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex",
