I need to triple check with Max.\nSent:03/04/2024 at 11:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 11:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Vyvanse\nMessage 1827 of 4024\nOh, ok. Yeah... the messaging can be confusing and may be inaccurate, maybe not. The idea of giving a teen (or anyone) three months of a controlled\nsubstance may be sketch. Love to know what you find out, but for 1k you would think that is correct.\nSent:03/04/2024 at 11:21 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 02:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: Vyvanse\nMessage 1828 of 4024\nAre you free at 3 to discuss SAAS email?\nSent:03/04/2024 at 02:16 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 02:16 PM)\nSubject:Saas - call\nMessage 1829 of 4024\nI am brokenhearted at Lori’s response. Adrian really needs this right now. His whole life has become a shit show. I have never seen him this unhappy.\nWe said we would do all we can for him and I can’t even reply on the thread or have a discussion with you. Even if I weigh, and now it looks stupid.\nSuggestions?\nSent:03/04/2024 at 02:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 02:17 PM)\nSubject:SAAS\nMessage 1830 of 4024\nAre you free at 3?
