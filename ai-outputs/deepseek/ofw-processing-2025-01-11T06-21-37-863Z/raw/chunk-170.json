Please call ASAP before this spins out of control\nSent:03/11/2024 at 08:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 09:59 AM)\nSubject:Urgent\nMessage 2094 of 4024\nI saw it too. I’m talking to AnnaLisa today.\nIn reading I understand we need to let them know if we don’t require their services or if we do and want a Parent Evaluator appointed.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 10:00 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 10:00 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2095 of 4024\nOn calls.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 10:01 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 10:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2096 of 4024\nOk...\nPlease don’t take this the wrong way. But my strong suspicion is that Annalisa just never filed the paperwork.  I say that because I saw the email to\nAnnalisa asking her to do that from my attorney and she seems slow sometimes. I could be wrong, however. We will see. But I think it’s an easy fix.\nI also let Lisa know that you planned to press charges today based on last night. But it’s still my hope we can go the Dr Brown route despite the fact\nthat it appears she has given up on us. Please fill her in on the details she needs if you think that helps.\nNote that with the parenting evaluation, we will need to 1) cancel our July mediation. No way to get that done before mid July. 2) start the six figure\ntrail prep. That July date was the last possible time we could do without beginning the trial preparations.\nI’d still very much like to work with you in the kids best interest and am willing to let Dr Brown author the plan  given her expertise. But you will need\nto let me know how you want to proceed. My assumption unfortunately is Lisa will advise zero contact soon.\nHope you have a good day and can compartmentalize this a bit. It’s a work day and you have my promise not to start or contribute to any distracting\ndrama on here. I want to enable the most peaceful and constructive atmosphere for you that I can.\nHave a great day, Christine...\nSent:03/11/2024 at 10:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 10:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent",
