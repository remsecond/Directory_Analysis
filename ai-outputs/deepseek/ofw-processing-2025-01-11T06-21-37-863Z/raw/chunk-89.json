I’ll think about it. Perhaps when I’m in a better place mentally. I realize based on my reaction yesterday, I have some healing to do.\nAppreciate the suggestion.\nSent:03/03/2024 at 06:04 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 08:17 AM)\nSubject:Re: Improving our Relationship for Everyone\nMessage 1810 of 4024\nI appreciate your thoughtful consideration of my suggestion. I recognize and respect your need for time and space to heal as we navigate the\ncomplexities of our current situation. The point I would like to make thoughtfully and constructively again is that the \"time to heal\" path is the one\nwe have taken since this began. So, reflecting on the results of that path, I am discouraged. I would propose balancing the \"time to heal\" with an\noption that at least changes up the recipe that has only made things worse by engaging in a neutral activity, which could serve as a meaningful step\ntowards this goal.\nI want to remove the tensions that mark our interactions by providing a space where we can be in the same room and enjoy a shared moment someone\nelse is directing. It is not about forgetting the challenges we face or disagreements that remain; it's about creating a moment that reminds us of the\nfundamental respect and connection that sustained us in better times. I hope the new ingredient in our recipe helps us respect our shared history and\nour love for our kids so we can establish a more congenial relationship that allows us to make decisions with less emotion and in their best interest.\nI understand this is a small step in a much larger journey of healing and reconciliation, and it doesn’t pretend to be a cure-all for the challenges we\nface. But given that what we are doing today is not working, I believe it's worth taking if it can lead us towards a more respectful and understanding\nrelationship, acknowledging our shared history and our love for our family. As mentioned, I'm open to this or any other activity that feels right to\nyou, and I'm committed to listening to your thoughts and suggestions. I'll wait, but let's find a way to move forward that honors our children and our\nindividual paths to healing.\nI know this scares you. I know you have concerns. But I assure you it is not meant to replace your healing process, which I fully respect and support. It\nis to complement it. What we are doing is not working, so I'm grateful for your willingness to consider this on our journey toward becoming effective\nco-parents. And we can always just walk away if we don't enjoy it. Let's blow some glass!\nHave a great day....\nSent:03/03/2024 at 11:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 11:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Improving our Relationship for Everyone",
