Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1987 of 4024\nThat was helpful. I think we’re aligned on everything now. I hope we can start doing that more regularly and save ourselves a lot of time and\nheartache.\nAns I agree we don’t need to devolve into the past. But let’s leave it all behind then and stop being mean. And I’m not gross for talking about the very\nreal love and passion we shared for 30 years. I am leaving now.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 02:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 11:52 PM)\nSubject:Thanks\nMessage 1988 of 4024\nIm driving.
