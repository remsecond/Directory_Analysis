  "text": "Message 1962 of 4024\nWe agreed that we would follow the RO and Parenting plan. I quoted you so there was no confusion. That is what we are doing. My entire concern\nwas we could not. That’s why I asked for a call. You assured me we would. I expect us to do that.\nYou are right!! Let’s not do calls till we get the new one in place. Just fyi- the reason I could not find the right one today is because yesterday Annalisa\nsent the wrong one again to Lisa and me yesterday.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 08:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 10:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1963 of 4024\nHey!\nGood morning! I think we have a few topics. Glad it does not have to be separate emails!\n• AD and Dad: I chatted with him earlier this AM. He is playing the new fortnight now so we agreed I would grab him around lunch.\n• SAAS: We are good to go. I'll keep you in the loop with any updates I get. I have talked to AD. We will get his charger back on Monday.\n• RO: Annalisa keeps sending the version that has \"physical violence.\" Should we update and send it to her instead to stop the confusion?\n• Parenting Plan: If I can get this to you and Annalisa today, can you guys formally approve it today so we can knock that out?\n• Sonos: I think they should all be down and ready for handoff now. What is going to work best for you so I can keep that moving?\n• Andy: As mentioned, I'm all in as you confirmed we would follow the Plan and RO. If you let him know that, we can start today.\nYikes! Six important topics in one exchange. I am extra appreciative of your cooperation and flexibility this week as this is still so hard. But we have are\nmaking progress. Teamwork !\n--------------------------- Andy Rules Exercise---------------------------\nJust for fun I did the calc on our Andy discussion. It was far simpler than SAAS, but it might be a decent barometer for what his email rules look like\nif with a recent, real-world example.\nWe had\n• 3 email exchanges\n• 18 OFW exchanges\nHis Cost\n• $ 5 - send one topic email\n• $20 - per mandatory reply\nResponse Rules\n• 24 hours for the questions\nSent:03/08/2024 at 09:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 09:09 AM)\nSubject:Abv.
