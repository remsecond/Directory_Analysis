  "text": "I think the first is going to be her opinion and pretty straightforward. The second could be dicey, right? The simple answer for her is to say, \"Submit\nand let the attorneys duke it out.\" In theory, that's great, but it really translates to \"we won't have a temp in place before a formal mediation.\"\nWe have flat out agreed 100% to terms of an RO, in writing and we are still arguing about it a whole month later. That is probably a bunny slope\ncompared to the triple black we are about to point our skis down. She said to \"disagree and move forward\" but we are not, and we are stuck.\nThis is not a dig. It's a realistic assessment of where are before we talk to a mental health professional when we have a history that we cannot agree on,\nand who we seem to selectively take advice from. IMHO, what we really need is a \"temp mediator\" and she won't play that role.\nI almost think we should have a list of things we know we are going to disagree on and just ask her for help. Otherwise, it's a rinse and repeat where she\nwill say \"This is just my advice as a professional\" then we \"hear what we want to hear\" followed by doing what we want to do.\nThen we're stuck with in same situation with our kids paying the price for adult disagreements.\nMessage 1855 of 4024\nDid Greg let you know yet?
