We could do something\nas simple as this too.\nYou are picking and choosing when to talk. I am documenting the SAAS Hail Mary and our amazing teamwork vs. your refusal to wordsmith in an\nattempt to work collaboratively.\nYou are intentionally, with forethought and malice, forcing an undue legal process and incurring wasteful and unnecessary burden to this process\nwith no regard to cost at this point.\nIf you would like to put the same effort into me reviving the SAAS opportunity for this, please let me know. I am all ears and willing to work with\nyou.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 09:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 09:29 AM)\nSubject:You Burn Our Money\nMessage 1928 of 4024\nIf thatâ€™s your approach, I knew any concession would be\nOFW it is until you sign revised RO\nSent:03/07/2024 at 09:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 09:35 AM)\nSubject:Re: You Burn Our Money",
