I need one and we have the little black one. But if the boys use it for popcorn I don’t want to take it for the same thing here.\n• Old planter set. I know you got nice new ones, but I’ve been restoring stuff here to save money. If they are not dented I could clean and paint.\nThanks!\nSent:02/25/2024 at 04:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 04:42 PM)\nSubject:Couple Things\nMessage 1623 of 4024\nI don’t know where the small black microwave is and will need to ask boys. I did not move it.\nThe other planter set had rusted through. It went to the dump.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 04:43 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Couple Things\nMessage 1624 of 4024\nIt’s usually in the man cave. No worries, I’ll wait.\nThanks for the planter info. Too bad. Duly noted.\nHope you had a wonderful day with the kids!\nSent:02/25/2024 at 04:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 05:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Couple Things\nMessage 1625 of 4024\nSent:02/25/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 08:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
