  "text": "Message 2208 of 4024\nHi Robert,\nYour lawyer requested we respond to the parenting plans in a week, which we will do.\nWe clearly have a different view on what is in best interest of the children considering the totality of what transpired and what it looks like to keep\nthem safe and address their overall emotional, mental and physical well being moving forward.\nI am on OFW. After the abuse of the OFW call to tell me you were worried about my mental state, I can’t trust you will use it in the way it was\nintended.\nChristine\nSent:03/18/2024 at 12:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/18/2024 at 12:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication as Healthy Coparents\nMessage 2209 of 4024\nThat’s not what I asked you. Please review.\nI am trying to work constructively with you. We had a super call this weekend and made everything right in two minutes. I even acknowledged the\nmiscue we had. We were good and sorted almost immediately. Please reconsider what was demonstrated to work and stop the black out in the best\ninterest of Max and Adrian.\nSent:03/18/2024 at 12:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/18/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication as Healthy Coparents\nMessage 2210 of 4024\nSo... you keep meticulous track of what does not work to reinforce your POV. May I please ask for the same accounting to be applied to both of our\nlast interactions? They work. I don’t push, I own when I misstep. And it’s done.\nIt also reminds me of our SAAS admissions week. Six huge agreements in four days because we communicated together to act as healthy co parents.\nLet’s be bold and take a chance to build on those two wins when we communicate.\nPlease consider success as a decision making metric.\nSent:03/18/2024 at 01:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/18/2024 at 03:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication as Healthy Coparents\nMessage 2211 of 4024\nWe were able to get some incredible things done over the last few days through short phone calls and team meetings. We got sass and five other things\nSent:03/18/2024 at 08:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/19/2024 at 07:04 AM)\nSubject:Mission accomplished- you killed itT\nAttachments:IMG_2053.PNG (571 KB)",
