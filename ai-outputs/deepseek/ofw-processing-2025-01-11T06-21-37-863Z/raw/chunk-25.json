  "text": "Message 1609 of 4024\nThank options for the heads up.\nIt’s honestly hard to know what you quit doing for us. Nothing changed wrt what I have done.\nI said I did not know what would start falling through the cracks, but it is playing out exactly as I said.\nYou always paid the bills. Always. I made sure to sell at the best possible price. I still do that for us.\nWe have no way to plan our finances or our future. You just quit and got an RO. It’s all going to hell.\nSent:02/24/2024 at 08:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 06:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1610 of 4024\nWith your support, Adrian and I were back in our groove pretty quickly. We talked, a lot, about a wide range of things. His face was lit. He was\nexcited. He could barely talk fast enough at times. He asked deep questions. From technical stuff to life stuff. We sat at the dinner table together and\nenjoyed dinner and each other’s company.\nNone of it would be possible without your blessing. You had one very happy little man yesterday. And his Daddy was pretty damn pleased himself! I\nalways called you “super mom”when we were the Moyer family, and yesterday you totally earned the crown again! It was awesome!\nI’d love to hear if he likes his place. I want Max and AD to have fun in the “boys getaway” I tried to make for them. I hope it’s a good place for sleep\novers. That was the intent. Especially for Max and Parker. It’s built with their summer jam in mind. Mom’s support would mean the world to us.\nThanks for everything!\nSent:02/25/2024 at 02:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 06:56 AM)\nSubject:Yesterday\nMessage 1611 of 4024\nYou cut me off from the account in your name in fidelity even though it is community property so I have no visibility or access to balances and what\nyou are doing.\nYou also made it clear in an email months ago that accessing your accounts in your name was invading your privacy so I never logged back into the\nAmex in your name. . I told you last time a payment was declined on your Amex I stopped logging in so I have no visibility if and when a payment is\ndue.\nI also just got a notice that 500 cash was transferred from the joint Bank of America account to an Apple Pay account. I assume that was you.\nYou have access to cash and have some control over assets in fidelity account so how you move or manage money around, I have no idea.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:52 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex",
