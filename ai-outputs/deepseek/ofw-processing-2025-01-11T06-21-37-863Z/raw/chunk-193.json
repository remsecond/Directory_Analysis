Given the dynamic we have i don’t believe discussion would be appropriate at this time.\nSent:03/14/2024 at 07:09 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 07:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: The Future\nMessage 2148 of 4024\nI’m asking to change the dynamic. You have always said it’s not right at this time. How has that worked out? When can you step back and\nacknowledge that saying “we are only doing it my way”’got us into this? You are too smart not to understand for 100th time saying your way or the\nhi-way makes us hate each other and is destroying our kids? This is really what you want from our divorce?\nSent:03/14/2024 at 07:14 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 12:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Future\nMessage 2149 of 4024\nI will take ownership of purchasing the breakfast items and silverware.
