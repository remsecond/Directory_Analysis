  "text": "The irreparable harm done over the last seven weeks is devastating. It has literally torn the Moyer family apart and cast reputations asunder. Just think\nabout if we had done this the next day, instead of now, given the result and recommendations. There is a lesson to be learned.\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied\" and we both got the justice we wanted so would you like to discuss next steps, or should I assume we are back into\nthe plan as recommended as a stopgap till the attorneys do their thing? Just let me know if you want to discuss here or by phone.\nWe both have crazy bitterness for the way this transpired, festered, and destroyed us as a family, just to end up here. Even though she was crazy hard\non me today, it is clear that if nothing changed except for fostering hate and distrust for a month and a half, we missed the mark.\nGiven we are both parents forever (co? parallel? fuck all?) to our kids, I hope we refer to her thoughtful words as we make decisions and consider their\nbest interests moving forward. What a total fucked up goat rodeo this was and the relationships it destroyed for me, are very real.\nPlease let me know if you are going to make time. I assure you I'll be peaceful and constructive.\n-robert\nMessage 1578 of 4024\nYou know we got Dr. Brown’s parenting plan back yesterday. Afterwards you checked out and I assume I won’t hear back from you till you get\naround to it in the morning. You can make up any excuse that you want, but you got exactly what you asked for and now you’re kind of being a bit of\na weenie. Just like when she told us last Saturday that I could see Adrian and it took you days to get back to me.\nYou can pretend like you don’t know what you’re doing but no one would buy it. It didn’t serve you well this time and it’s not gonna serve you well\nnext time. At some point, you actually have to put the children first as Dr Brown or the next court appointed facilitator will do and quit thinking of\nyourself. Obviously, I’m documenting a consistent pattern going back to October for one thing or another.\nI’ve always had 50-50 custody of our kids but you block me at every move from seeing them since it is not “on strategy” with Anna Lisa as you told\nDebbie and she reminded me of. Even when I’ve done every thing you asked- blow test, meetings, dna analysis (not your bullshit hair test) your\nfreaking RO, that says I credibly will beat my kids.wtf is that?\nAt some point an adult will seethis Christine. One did yesterday. The difference next time is that you will have a proven track record of obstructionist\nbullshit to go along with it to reinforce you are a shitty mom who is focusing on deflecting blame. Just like you did for blowing up our family, or\nbeing inappropriate with Kevin Otero and lying about it.\nI wish I could respect your journey and feel like it had some merit, even if misguided. But it does not. You lie, cheat, and blame everyone but yourself.\nI actually feel bad for you. It’s a sign of someone who can’t cope with their own actions and needs it to be someone else’s fault. Always. Always.\nAlways. The reason you hate me, is I call it out.\nGood luck with that! Hope he makes you feel better about yourself and tells you that you are always right.\nSent:02/24/2024 at 12:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Just another day with V little\nMessage 1579 of 4024\nJust re-read Dr Brown’s note. It’s clear I let the emotions I feel due to your intentional inaction get the best of me. Going after you for continuing\nyour pattern is neither constructive nor useful. History shows that. Please accept my sincere apologies. I am hopeful you will tune in at some point\nand take her words as seriously as I am now. I’m sorry, Christine.\nSent:02/24/2024 at 08:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/24/2024 at 09:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Just another day with V little",
