  "text": "Message 1633 of 4024\nI just replied to you being concerned about the naughty pictures that was all. I am telling you I love you. And our secrets will go to my grave with me.\nI am not trying to give you a hard time. If we had a way we could talk and be decent to each other I would talk there. Not here, but you won’t allow\nme to even have a conversation with you. So this is the only place I can talk, I don’t plan to ever share this thread with anyone do you? What we did is\nno one’s business but ours.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1634 of 4024\nYou are well aware I can not do anything. I am not allowed access anymore and I have repeatedly told you that.\nWhat is stopping you from trying to solve it by picking up the phone?\nThis will just come out your share.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1635 of 4024\nGoing back to the discussion from earlier.\nYou pay the bills, I sell at the best price\nWe agreed to continue and I do today\nYou stopped and I asked you to tell me\nI am not paying because you stopped\nThis would all be solved in “running list”\nYou block all efforts at peaceful resolution\nYou know tand intentional do it every week\nI complain every week that you do this\nRinse repeat. This part is all documented\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1636 of 4024\nBy the way, for the record, Dr. Brown said:\nIt would’ve been better if you had come to me and let me know what the problem was so we could’ve dealt with it as a married couple. That was\nwhat’s best for the kids and us. That’s what Debbie said. You did not.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
