  "text": "Message 1612 of 4024\nThanks for the helpful explanation.\nFidelity- what did I cut off? You never had access is what I understood. Please let me know.\nAMEX- it’s like the phone or Xfinity right? I don’t care. Big deal. We are married. I did not know you just quit paying the bill. And I asked you to tell\nme if so. Can you please resume that until we are final?\nApple Cash- yes, of course. The Sneaker Con had no internet. And no way to pay for things other than that. So AD got two pairs of shoes, and a T-\nshirt he really wanted. I hope that is not an issue. See attached.\nFidelity Account- yes, I do have access and I can pay from there but it’s not set up to, I would need yet another account for that. It won’t do bill pay.\nWe agreed nothing would change. But you did. I even have $20k in review from a transfer I sent Friday so we would continue to operate as we had\nagreed.\nThis is the only way to communicate you allow. So we will continue to find out what you are not doing after the fact, while I continue what I said I\nwould do.\nEven this exchange should have cost us 1k for our attorneys to do over a month because Anna Lisa is slow and imprecise. You know that by now.\nIf this explanation is simply too long for you to understand, it’s unfortunate. Details matter. I’m trying to work with, especially during our test week.\nThis does not, and has never worked for us.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nAttachments:IMG_1625.PNG (868 KB)",
