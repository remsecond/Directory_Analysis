Coffefve was low-hanging fruit as it gets me wired, but I miss it. Sooo... I\nstarted mixing the beans in the Jura ahead of time- ~70% Decaf & ~30% Full Caf... now I get to enjoy 2-3 cups in the AM instead of one and I love it.\n\nI know this is dumb, but thought I would let you know in case you wanted to try it ...\nSent:02/26/2024 at 08:21 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 08:50 AM)\nSubject:Low Pri- Dumb Suggestion\nMessage 1652 of 4024\nNot sure who did the removal of the closet stuff but they took out things that should have stayed, especially if we ever sell. They also screwed up the\nSonos and it won't work. I think they just looked at everything \"not Xfinity\", yanked it all out, and threw it in a box.\nI'll get over that, but Just letting you know some things will need to be replaced so there is a cost involved. I'll go one by one starting at the network\nlevel and be sure I do the bare minimum. And if that all works well, the speakers and subs, etc... should all be fine.\nI really hope that in the coming months, we get back to a place where we trust again. And where I can help with the house. Some things need\nmaintenance or updates to maintain the property value we worked so hard for over many years, but I get it will take time.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 09:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 09:52 AM)\nSubject:Sonos and stuff...\nMessage 1653 of 4024\nI think your interpretation of Dr Brown’s advice may be to “read and don’t reply” to things I say or send. Even in the friendliest way, with the most\nconstructive attempt to foster a healthier working relationship.\nMy feedback would be, is that how you would interact with your boss? Because it feels like it’s contrary to common etiquette and feels like a power\nplay to poke me and say “I’m not working with you”. If that’s the intention, and you think that is how you would treat your boss, then I guess I’ll\naccept that.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 10:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 12:06 PM)\nSubject:So We Work Better Together",
