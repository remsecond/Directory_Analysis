  "text": "If you share ahead of time, as I offered to do with you on every occasion, I can see changes, and we walk through them more effectively. I'll have her\nguidance to compare it with prior to the call. I assume we both track changes, so we are transparent and just do it.\nWe should aim to be as close to Dr Brown's guidance as possible and both be prepared, as she likes to say, to be \"equally unhappy. \" And if we don't\nagree, it would be much more cost-effective and beneficial to our mental health to ask to schedule time with her.\nWhich was why I called the last meeting. Because I did not want us to have TWO versions of her and  then pay tons of money to have our lawyers\nfight it out. It was specifically to avoid us having an impasse before we even got started. Let's please consider that.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 03:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Parenting Plan\nMessage 2083 of 4024\nI will discuss changes with but not language as I may tweak it.\nWe opted not to go with a full Parent Evaluation. Dr Brown did not speak to Adrian about the history and you insisted it be limited to that one event.\nShe has never had the full story. A full parent evaluation is still in my mind an option, if I don’t believe full accountability and recognition of your\nactions and impact are considered and reflected in how we structure the plan.\nI am growing increasingly concerned by your accusatory tone, bringing up delays as my fault, and a minimization of impact of your 25 history on the\nfamily. In one breathe you will say it, then point to a recent 4 month window out of 25 years that things may have been stable and you you showed up\nin a way a father is normally expected to. In that window, what you fail to mention is regression to unsafe behavior, emotional dis regulation, relapse\nfrom sobriety, and recent unlawful surveillance activity. It is with that lens I structure the plan for best interest of children in mind.\nThis is aside from continued insistence that you and I develop a friendly relationship, that I have been advised by mental health professionals, is not\nappropriate at this time given the history of DV and coercion and control. That request must stop.\nIt is in my right to change my mind after i experience various factors, which includes continuation of behaviour that I feel are unsafe\nYou may feel anger at this. I can’t control that. What you are not in your right to do is lash out at me. An RO was filed to protect me from that\nbehavior.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 04:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 05:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Parenting Plan",
