  "text": "Message 2158 of 4024\nGood Morning-\nI can't seem to get an answer from you on almost anything we are trying to do together, so I pulled some of the most pressing concerns into one of our\nfamiliar \"running list\" formats that works well for us. Please see below. I do need some things answered today. Have a great day!\nRobotics Breakfast-   I was planning to buy bagels, cream cheese, yogurt and silverware tonight. Given Max’s feedback regarding in person viewing\nwhich I shared, I did not plan to attend the competition this weekend.\nAD visit Time-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\nRestraining Order-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\nParenting Plan-  I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\nSpring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\nDr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like.\nReturning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous\nnature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely.\n3rd Party emails- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.\nXfinity-  Please provide evidence I will not stop creating the situation months later. Xfinity told me this is an impossible scenario. Please stop\nmonitoring our internet.\nDrop-In-  PLEASE UNPLUG THE DEVICES. I have communicated to you on numerous occasions I do not know what is happening and have not\nmade any attempt to drop in on you.\nAndy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.\nEven under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO?\nOFW expectations- OFW will be the platform.\nPlease consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a\nfalse RO you mistakenly filed. The impact is that we are not able to co-parent in a child-centered way or resolve ongoing property situations in a\ntimely or amicable way.\nI want to work with you to determine how we do this in the best interest of all involved and in a cost-effective way that does not require an attorney\nto send an attorney the same question I already sent you. That seems frivolous, expensive, and unnecessary, so I hope we can reach a more amicable\nand less expensive solution.\nSent:03/15/2024 at 11:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/15/2024 at 11:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Running List for 3/15",
