  "text": "can coordinate our commitment. What is the plan for tomorrow?\nAD visit Time- You have clawed back almost all the Dr. Brown recommended approved visits. She noted that Adrian wanted to see me even a month\nago. When do I get to see him again as she said he needed?\nRestraining Order- The version that frivolously states I am a \"credible threat to do physical harm\" has been filed for months. What is your plan to\nremedy the false public portrayal of my character?\nParenting Plan- Our journey includes five therapists and six parenting plans, beginning with the one I wrote and shared on Sept 22. No, predictability\nis destructive to our kid's mental health. What are your next steps?\nSpring Break- We had a plan that Dr Brown sanctioned for me to have this one. You ignored it along with the parenting plan. I proposed a healthy,\nchild-focused compromise. What is your response?\nDr. Brown- You said she was not able to offer an appropriate parenting plan because she was uninformed after 10 meetings. We both offered you the\nopportunity to educate her. Do you plan to do that?\nReturning Sonos- We communicate weekly on this, and you assure me you will get these to me. You sent me trash instead of the Sonos in January.\nWhat are your plans to get these to me as promised?\n3rd Party emails- You are blocking me from co-parenting with 3rd parties via the RO to co-parent unless you need me to reverse Adrian's SAAS\nrejection, which I miraculously did. Can I participate on these?\nXfinity- Every day, I send you screen captures of the alerts you send me via Xfinity. These were the basis for your surveillance claims. You won't stop\ncreating the situation months later. Is this on purpose?\nDrop-In- You're aware you still have drop-in audio and video capabilities to surveil me. I send you screen captures of your recent call attempts that\nyou deny doing. I've asked that we stop this. How do we stop?\nAndy Benjamin- We agreed in writing that we would see him as our divorce counselor at Dr. Brown's recommendation. Your RO prevents us from\ndoing that. Are you backing out of that commitment?\nOFW expectations- You have this list of questions because you read my co-parenting requests to coordinate child-centered or property-focused\ntopics, but don't reply. Is there a plan to replace OFW?\nPlease consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a\nfalse RO you mistakenly filed. The impact is that we are not able to co-parent in a child-centered way or resolve ongoing property situations in a\ntimely or amicable way.\nI want to work with you to determine how we do this in the best interest of all involved and in a cost-effective way that does not require an attorney\nto send an attorney the same question I already sent you. That seems frivolous, expensive, and unnecessary, so I hope we can reach a more amicable\nand less expensive solution.\nPlease advise, and have a great day!\nbest\n-robert",
