Please advise if\nthey do not.\nElapsed time: 1 day and 6 hours\nI asked if I could take AD to Sneaker Con. I have his newly authenticated shoes here if he would like to take them and swap, bargain, or sell them\nbased on their authenticity. It will definitely let him feel like a real \"player\" with skin in the game. That's what this is about.\nIdeally, I could come grab him this afternoon, we shoot and eat dinner, he spends the night, and I have him back after sneaker con. It is a gorgeous\nday. I have been asking for weeks now and the prerequisite for seeing me has been met and time together has been approved.\nThanks for your thoughtful consideration as my Co-Parent.\nKindest Regards,\nRobert Moyer\n1919 Killarney Way\nBellevue Wa, 98004\nSent:02/23/2024 at 12:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 02:55 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\nMessage 1568 of 4024\nCan I assume that based on what I am seeing, you are no longer interested in peaceful mediation despite me doing everything you have asked?
