  "text": "Max expressed he would not like us there as it is a distraction to him and causes him stress and anxiety. I plan to respect that.\nMessage 2150 of 4024\nThanks for the info. Then obviously I won’t go either. It is unfortunate that “your plan” has made you the single conduit between Max and I. This\nhas meant I have only had two short meal visits - Thanksgiving and the 2nd Xmas day gathering in 161 days. But this is your plan and only your plan.\nSo under your “self proclaimed, child centered” approach your plan pencils out to less than 24 hours a year. Curious to see  if the mediator or judge\nagrees that your omnipotent approach is consistent with best practices in a divorce.\nSo, I do nothing now?\nSent:03/14/2024 at 12:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 12:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Robotics/Breakfast\nMessage 2151 of 4024\nTrying to get an answer to the question below.

That was us less than a week ago. We have gone from violent cooperation to your plan.\nReflecting on where we were vs where we are, what’s your appraisal of your new approach? Better now?\nIMHO it feels like you feel obligated to vigorously destroy anything we do that works for the kids.\nIs that intentional, or just a subconscious mandate?\nSent:03/14/2024 at 01:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 01:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2153 of 4024\nIt was advised that unification therapy be explored for you and Max.\nIt was discussed that attempts to force Max into a situation that he resisted, would be detrimental to his mental and emotional health.\nSent:03/14/2024 at 01:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 02:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Robotics/Breakfast",
