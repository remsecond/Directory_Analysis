I will also assure you that, we will limit\nit to just that time and just that topic.\nBut I’ll also call out how successful we were today in coordinating for Adrian when we had an open, two-way communication channel. I’m not gonna\nbeat a dead horse and point this out to you again, but we seem to have a win on important issue every week when we just stop, chat, agree on action\nitems, and just get shit done. Never fails.\nLooking forward to confirmation of how you would like to do this moving forward. It’s that important.\n———————- Notes I sent to AD ———————-\nSo, really great play tonight. I like seeing you make more friends with the guys there and it’s obvious you’re getting a little more comfortable. That\nallows you to play a little bit looser and with a little bit more confidence. That mental part is super important.\nYour hustle was really strong, you get through the picks very quickly, and you understand when a ball handler needs a pick set for himself. You even\nhad a couple good give and goes flashing under the hoop. Of course, one of those led to an easy basket.\nSent:03/22/2024 at 07:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/23/2024 at 07:02 AM)\nSubject:Co-Parenting Better",
