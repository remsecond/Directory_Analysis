I was trying to reach out and be kind.In return, may I ask that when we are in front of the kids you stop screaming at me.\nYesterday, like you always did when I was in Bellevue on the Adrian drop offs, you started screaming at me yesterday in front of Max.\nWith Adrian, you would get out of the car and start yelling at me despite Dr. Brown’s advice that that should never happen with him there.\nYesterday, you demanded therapist names. I said I would speak to Lisa so you pointed your finger and started screaming “we are at war.”\nThis was with Max, right after a therapy session to check in on how he is doing. In my opinion this causes extreme parental alienation and damage.\nI will no longer request you to be peaceful, civil, or constructive given your request. I will however ask you to stop these outbursts in front of our kids.\nThanks for your consideration in the best interest of their mental health.\n-robert\nSent:03/24/2024 at 08:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 09:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nMessage 2292 of 4024\nDocumenting what you are saying below is a false narrative.\nJust because you say it does not mean it to be true.\nI have asked on multiple occasions not for us to talk anytime. You refuse and continuing demand I do so and even come and insist to sit next to me or\nwill find me and insist you stand next to me.\nIt makes me feel emotional and physically unsafe.\nYou will follow me to the car despite my protests and repeatedly request/demand I meet you or discuss a topic. This is often followed up by an e-mail\nrequesting the same which is documented.\nI say NO repeatedly.\nDO NOT SIT NEXT TO ME, FOLLOW ME TO THE CAR, ASK ME TO TALK at any of the events.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 09:43 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 09:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion",
