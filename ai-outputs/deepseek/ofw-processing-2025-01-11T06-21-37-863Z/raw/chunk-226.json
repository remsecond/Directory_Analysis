I’ve found that even when I say I agree with everything you say, I’m in the dog\nhouse.\nI’m just hoping to do right by AD and Max (and you). And work with you if you let me. Then get this thing back on track. I really do want to be\nnormal again!\nHope work is going well... I know it’s tough!\nSent:03/21/2024 at 01:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 01:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Today\nMessage 2247 of 4024\nI’m just asking you share the names of the 5 therapists you are referring to.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 01:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Today\nMessage 2248 of 4024\nHey-\nSo... still nothing. Just wanted us to stay in sync since I think we both assume our expensive attorneys are doing things they may or may not be doing.\nThat said, what I said yesterday I meant. The kids we brought into this world with so much hope for forever as a happy family, are still our number\none priority.\nI’m % committed to the best for them. It’s just a matter of figuring out who represents their “voice” best since they don’t seem to say the same thing!\nAnd I really hope we can put our differences aside long enough to be the best we can be for their benefit. They didn’t ask for this and don’t deserve it.\nWishing you the best!\n-robert\nSent:03/21/2024 at 05:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 05:47 PM)\nSubject:Still No Word\nMessage 2249 of 4024\nYour attorney should have our response on RO, next steps for supervised visits and engagement of Parenting Evaluator.\nCould you also send the name of the 5 therapists you have referenced in communications?\nSent:03/21/2024 at 05:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 06:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word",
