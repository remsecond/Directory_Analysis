I’m on calls upstairs so can’t coordinate.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 11:41 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 11:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1976 of 4024\nWhat do you want him to help with? It's all in black and white already. How can I help you?\nAt this point, this conversation by his rules, would mean:\n• $150 to read and reply\n• 240 hours or ten days\nI don't see the confusion, tbh. You said I did not coordinate. I did. I sent you the coordination.\nYou can keep saying you don't grok that, but do we need someone else to recap and just say:\n\"He told you he would coordinate\"\n\"He confirmed that he coordinated\"\n\"You said he did not coordinate\"\n\"He showed you he did coordinate\"\n\"You said you needed help to understand\"\nAnd you are at home? You said you were going in. This could have been so simple.\nThis was my day. It was confirmed until you stepped in. I'm starting to get frustrated.\nYou own next steps with Andy. Again, I have 8 emails that document our agreement.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 12:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 12:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1977 of 4024\nNo you own Andy. I said you should check with Lisa as I’m not responsible if it violates terms of RO. That’s on you.\nYes I came home to do the rest of my calls.\nI came home and said make sure you are ready for dad pick up for lunch. He was surprised and said oh.... Can we do 3pm.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 12:03 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 12:19 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8",
