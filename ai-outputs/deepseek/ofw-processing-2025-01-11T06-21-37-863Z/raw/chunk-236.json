  "text": "Message 2281 of 4024\nI’m not putting any details of what just happened into this message because that would be seen as inflammatory and counter  productive to my\nsincere efforts, and outreach to try and work constructively with you. I understand the perspective and will do my best to avoid giving you the\nimpressions you seem to be concerned about. You will see that reflected in my heartfelt communications.\nIf we have to go through our capable attorneys, our kids will feel a real impact. We have three examples of serious consequences that would have\noccurred with Adrian in the last ten days. So I’m asking again, please let me know how we can work together instead of against each other. Let’s find a\nway to activate that superpower we shared for three decades.\nThis is not working and only getting worse. Let’s stop the slide.\n• robert\nSent:03/23/2024 at 01:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/23/2024 at 06:32 PM)\nSubject:Post Therapy Discussion\nMessage 2282 of 4024\nI think that is SAAS\nSent:03/23/2024 at 06:32 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/23/2024 at 10:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Auction Tonight\nMessage 2283 of 4024\nI assume you approved this one?\nI miss being able to laugh with you. Damn, we would laugh so hard together. I hope we will again someday.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 10:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:AD Purchase...\nAttachments:IMG_2209.PNG (368 KB)\nMessage 2284 of 4024\nHere is why I thought it was ICS. If we have a SAAS opportunity soon, we should put on our big boy pants and go together. They helped us in a real\ntime of need. We don’t need to pay a lot of money, but we should at least be present imho.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 10:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Auction Tonight\nAttachments:IMG_2210.PNG (608 KB)",
