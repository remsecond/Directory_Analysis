I excited and relieved that there is no difference between the RO & Parenting Plan and what he wants us to do.\nIf you agree, you could enable OFW calls tonight for urgent and emergency situations and let’s do it! Thanks again!\nSent:03/07/2024 at 07:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 07:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1961 of 4024\nHe does not allow calls. I don’t know about face to face like basketball game.\nFor email, guess would need to clarify if as he is in it, it’s ok per RO.\nTBH, you might want to check with Lisa. You violating the RO is on you, not me. Courts do not look kindly on persons who violate court orders or\ndisregard.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 07:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 07:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy",
