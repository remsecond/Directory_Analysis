  "text": "If you want to do the weekend march 23/24 take him and Dylan to ski on Sunday, please do. I don’t expect that anytime kids have an event or activity\nthat falls on your day, I’m penalized for time away so you get my time. I need non school time with them too.\nThis Wednesday, today, I also see we have meeting with Kari Bates so would not have been able to anyway. So now I’m annoyed you are kicking up a\nstink.\nMessage 1898 of 4024\nOur Phase I, as you know had Wed 1/2 days. We did this because I shot hoops with him several times a week and the plan limited it to us to once\nevery two weeks. That was a huge reduction and you graciously accommodated a smaller reduction. Dr Brown had agreed to update the plan but as\nshe mentioned, her memory is bad and did not.\nYou are just ignoring Wed and that is four opportunities a month that I had and you are making no mention of at all and going on about overnights\nand skiing. You have had him solo for several months now and ski with him every weekend. Does that count as “non-school” time because I am\nconfused about what you are saying.\nYou can get mad at me and start yet another fight, but that’s what you said you would stop. I don’t think either of us remembered Kari Betts as you\nmight not have scheduled him today for something. I also addressed this in the email I noted you should see below but ignored. So here we are again.\nI would prefer to briefly talk about this so we don’t get mad and have crossed wires. Dr Brown said to resume Phase I now. That is not what I see. If\nthat’s what your choice is let’s call a spade a spade and move on. But all the narrative below on what you do while you have him 100% if the time is\nconfusing. I just want to follow Dr Brown’s guidance.\nThanks. You can be “annoyed” I asked but it’s frankly not helpful and incendiary to the conversation.\nLet’s both do better.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 06:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\nMessage 1899 of 4024\nI realize you made the Kerri Betts appointment. But it is not on my calendar. Am I involved or did you not share the event? I have nothing.
