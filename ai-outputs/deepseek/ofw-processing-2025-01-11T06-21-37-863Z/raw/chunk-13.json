Your way since this all began has been a smashing success. Shop for opinions that align with your primary objective. Choose the ones you like,\ndisregard the ones you don’t.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:45 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 07:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: Bummer..\nMessage 1562 of 4024\nNo. You did not. Super frustrating to depend on you for every most important thing in my son’s life.\nI accept your apology\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 07:54 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS\nMessage 1563 of 4024\nI appreciate the outreach. I need to think about how to navigate.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:54 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 08:01 AM)\nSubject:Re: Bummer..\nMessage 1564 of 4024\nI just checked and I added you to the thank you email to Kristen on Tuesday.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:55 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS\nMessage 1565 of 4024\nI was on that. That is what I quoted in my OFW note to you. She said she would do it. And there has been zero follow up or confirmation it\nhappened in the last four days. That is why I asked for the nudge.\nI would have wanted to confirm what she said she would do Tuesday really happened because we saw nothing to confirm it has. It’s just follow\nthrough\nMake sense?\nSent:02/23/2024 at 08:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 08:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS",
