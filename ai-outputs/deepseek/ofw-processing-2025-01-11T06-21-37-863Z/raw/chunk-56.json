I know you are super busy. We can work through our “stuff” when the time is right.\nI was alarmed by the documentation at first. But Lisa sent something to Anna Lisa explaining how it all works and proposed that we agree.\nIt makes sense to me and i am happy to just explain it to you. It will be much faster like Lisa did for me. It won’t happen this week anyway.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 09:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 09:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Dead in the Water\nMessage 1695 of 4024\nFYI\nSent:02/27/2024 at 10:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 11:40 AM)\nSubject:Mail\nAttachments:IMG_1662.jpg (3 MB)",
