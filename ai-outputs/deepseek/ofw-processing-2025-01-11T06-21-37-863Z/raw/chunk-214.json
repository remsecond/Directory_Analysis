  "text": "mentally abusing our children as you work your way to the bottom of the barrel because no professional, child focused professional supports your\nside. Opinion shop all you like, but it’s still ongoing mental abuse.\nYour story and justification for child abuse has twisted and evolved since July. Booze, mushrooms (you did), DV, multiple accusations of monitoring\n(8?). This is all while you maintain drop in functionality on me, and persist in sending me alerts on what’s happening on your network that I have\nasked you to stop for months to falsely say I’m monitoring you. You won’t stop.\nThat is pretty much the totality of what happened unless you want to dig deeper on the incident that triggered your change of tune from the “Alyssa\nmodel” to “Sherman’s March to the Sea”. So as you and your child focused attorney focus on a solution that stops the child abuse you continue to\njustify I’m not confident in your ability to make sound decisions.\nThey say “3rd times the charm”, right? Well this will be the 7th time. And that’s if your higher wisdom is accepted as canon law with zero negotiation\nback with a parent that has the same legal rights you have. May I suggest you pause your child abuse until you come down from the mount with the\nstone tablets from god? Or google searches and your lawyer.\nYou realize this could never be a movie. People would walk out after the third try because the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th would seem so abusive to the\nkids and implausible in real life it would be a waste of time to sit through. Unfortunately our kids are not only sitting through it, they are living it. I\nlook forward to the explanation and education for why this is healthy.\nMessage 2198 of 4024\nTrying to do call you so we can have the same result as yesterday. Two minutes max. It worked then and I’m hoping we can resolve something really\nquickly before it becomes a problem. But you won’t pick up.\nSo I don’t know if you have just decided not to allow a repeat of our accomplishment that allows us to share our thoughts real quick before it turns\nugly, or you are just choosing to stop emergency communications.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 04:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Thank You\nMessage 2199 of 4024\nOk... I’ve tried several times and you refuse to pick up or respond here. I am trying to just have a quick convo in accordance with your guidance so we\ncan have a peaceful and constructive resolution to an urgent issue.\nI am not looking to fight or even quarrel. It worked wonders yesterday. In two minutes we moved mountains and settled TWO big issues and\narranged next steps to fix the issue of you having “drop in” capability in one call.\nWhenever something works great and shows we can be a team, you seem to immediately crap on it and stop. Why do you do that? It feels like the RO\nand Parenting Plan, where you appear to be dead set on failure at all costs.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 04:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 04:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thank You",
