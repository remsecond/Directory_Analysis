  "text": "Message 1818 of 4024\nNP... thanks again.\nHope you had a wonderful day and you are able to prepare for the week effectively.\nMy offer still stands to help you out in any way I can.\nSent:03/03/2024 at 05:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 06:48 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>\nMessage 1819 of 4024\nGood Morning,\nIn the quiet moments following this weekend's tensions, I've found myself deeply reflecting on usâ€”not just in the context of our family, but as two\nindividuals who've shared a life together. This period of separation has prompted me to appreciate the magnitude of what we've achieved over the\nyears. Despite our differences, perhaps even our incompatibilities, we've built something truly significant, and it shows in our kids. It's a testament to\nour efforts, my deep respect for you, and what we've tried to accomplish together.\nPerhaps later than you, I realize that we are far more different as human beings than I knew before- on so many levels. I believe neither of us was ready\nfor what we dove headlong into on \"Ashbury beach picture day\" with a belief we could will our way through, with best intentions, ignoring our own\nbaggage from our pasts. Our commitment to making marriage work was remarkable in itself. Whether driven by love, duty, or the sheer desire to\nuphold our vows, what we did was real, challenging, and worthy of recognition.\nI don't want another long message, instead, I'll simply express my hope for a future where we can sit down together, acknowledging the good times\nand the tough, with a focus on moving forward. In a future where we appreciate our efforts without judgment, we understand that we may not have\nbeen fully prepared for the challenges we faced, but we recognize the sincerity of our attempts. I'll be the first to admit that I wish I had the wisdom\nyou have now, back then, and made an effort to change sooner. Hindsight is 20/20.\nI acknowledge your efforts are coming from a place you believe is best. But I hope you will open up to a shared perspective from someone who has\nlessons of his own from the past he wants to share from also.\nI'm here if you need anything. And I mean that. Have a great day.\n-robert\nSent:03/04/2024 at 05:42 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 06:48 AM)\nSubject:Hoping for a Good Week\nMessage 1820 of 4024\nFigured out a way to use the component you had in the car Saturday. If you don't mind bringing that next time we swap stuff, that would be super.\nSent:03/04/2024 at 06:30 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 06:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>",
