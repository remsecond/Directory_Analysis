You know that. Plus, you’ve been involved with them. I don’t want to be drawn\ninto a fight with you, Christine. Let’s not do that.\nAnd I’m trying to honestly figure out who said visits have to be supervised. We always look at their qualifications together, and consider how well\nthey know our kids. So please share the expertise.\nI mean after all, who would’ve thought that Dr. Brown was not qualified? She met with us over 10 times in 3 1/2 months. Did two parenting plans\nand has a PhD. But clearly she’s not capable of that decision.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 07:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 07:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2256 of 4024\nI’m sorry, I’m lost. Where did I say that?\nSent:03/21/2024 at 07:07 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 07:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2257 of 4024\nQuit being silly. You’ve been involved with each one of them. I’ve isolated my Sonos request for three months. That didn’t get me anywhere. Don’t\nmake me document our shared history for your lawyer. God knows when it fits your narrative you have no issues with your memory. So please stop\npoking at me.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 09:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Names of 5 therapists",
