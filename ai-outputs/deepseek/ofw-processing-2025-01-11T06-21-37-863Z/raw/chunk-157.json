You seem very motivated when it comes to figuring out how I can support you. I assume that will be a lot easier than allowing me to see my\nchildren.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:36 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2052 of 4024\nI think I understand. I’ll look what I am currently paying for separately to see if we are getting charged twice for something.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:36 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apple Family Plan\nMessage 2053 of 4024\nI still don’t think you get it. You don’t need to look anything you spend on Apple, the App Store subscriptions or your iPhone is paying for it twice.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apple Family Plan\nMessage 2054 of 4024\nI am working on the parenting plan now. I actually have a lot of updates now that I have seen the entire document and how they interact with\ndifferent sections.\nIt has sections for summer and holidays that need to be hashed out in mediation and not in this doc. I also have changes to major decision making\nshould you violate the ro or relapse. How it was drafted does not make sense in totality.\nI know you will be frustrated by my changes but now that I have the full document, I need to make adjustments knowing this is what is intended just\nto get us to July 12.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 11:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver",
