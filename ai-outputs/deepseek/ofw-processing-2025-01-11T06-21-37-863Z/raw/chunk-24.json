Thank you!\nAnd you skipped the earlier question.\nSent:02/24/2024 at 07:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/24/2024 at 07:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Today\nMessage 1607 of 4024\nWe owe it to both our kids to be able to have frank discussions about them at this point in their lives. Today was a blast. Amazing. And thank you so\nmuch for letting me do sneaker con. That meant a lot to both of us.\nBut also, I noticed a lot of social anxiety and behaviors in him that I would like to be able to openly discuss with you. You can blame it on me, but will\nnever know if that’s really the issue and you can’t blame everything bad on me without giving me credit for some of the good.\nBut either way, till they are out of our house, you and I owe it to them to be able to have a dialogue in their best interest. We are the parents . We\nshould be working as a team together regardless of how we feel about each other, we should unite in their best interest.\nWe really need to start getting over ourselves or at least compartmentalized to the point where we can do them justice in their childhood. I think after\nall that was the point of you doing all of this. So if we can stop blaming each other and start putting them first, I will work constructively with you on\nthat.\nBut we both have to do it together babe. Let’s try!\nSent:02/24/2024 at 08:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/24/2024 at 08:24 PM)\nSubject:Adrian\nMessage 1608 of 4024\nI got a text message that Amex account payment is past due.
