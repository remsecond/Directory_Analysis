Of course I don’t know where to look.\nDo you know our next sell point for AMD? Where we are margin buying? No.. because that is what I do and I don’t expect you to know my side.\nYou’re telling me all this after the fact. We are here for the reasons mentioned below. I said we will crash and burn every week. Welcome to reality.\nYou can keep finger pointing or fucking start working together.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1640 of 4024\nYou don’t get it. I opened my eyes to the abuse.\nI did not hurt you was the response when I said you stabbed the wall next to me with a knife.\nThat was just one example in thousands. Thousands Robert.\nI will never ever go back to someone like that. Ever!\nI am now resolved to fight for those or you will somehow feel vindicated that it did not happen.\nGoodnight Robert. I thought you were in DV therapy. Clearly that is not happening\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1641 of 4024\nI’m going to push for mediation date now.
