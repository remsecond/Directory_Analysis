  "text": "Message 2267 of 4024\nSpeaking of replacements, since you decided to cancel my Cabo trip in October then banked my credit for the room during the best week of the entire\nyear, please advise when you will book an equivalent experience for me. I’d like to get that sorted pretty quickly. And given that you’ve taken all the\ntime to go ahead and book more Cabo vacations for yourself, I’m sure you can make this a priority.\nI’m gonna tell you an advance, I don’t really care to hear about “subject to availability” issues that you may face. My vacation in October was not\nsubject to availability. I paid over 50 K to have that week not ever have a “subject to availability” issue. You took that from me. So “subject to\navailability” may be your problem. But please do not expect to make it my problem.\nObviously, I don’t wanna go in the hot months of summer. I will be expecting something at peak and of equivalent value. So as a favor to you , I am\nopen to also discussing replacing that by staying at another place of equal or greater value. Maybe like the one you just did in California. I know you\nmentioned it was a five star resort that reminded you a lot of Grand Solmar....\nFor that matter, we have pretty clear accounting of all your luxury travels here and abroad over the last year. So you should have some really good\nideas. Looking forward to solving this in a peaceful, constructive and equitable way like we did the Sonos.\nSent:03/22/2024 at 04:27 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 07:21 AM)\nSubject:Our Room\nMessage 2268 of 4024\nThe Oct 2024 3 bedroom date is yours. you can take the April 6-13 date at Rancho. We are not going.\nI’ll send you the customer service number and account details so you can request exactly what you want moving forward.\nIf you want something in 2025 for 2 bedroom, now is time to book that if it’s a year in advance.\nI am not going to argue if you want to book/use all the units we have for this year and next.\nSent:03/22/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 10:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Our Room",
