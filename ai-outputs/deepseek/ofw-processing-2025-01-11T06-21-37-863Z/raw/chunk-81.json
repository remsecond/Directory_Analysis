Let me\nshoulder some burden to let you catch your breath!\nNo harm in that!\nMessage 1782 of 4024\nI agree. We have a very different perspective on how we got here.\nI’m doing and have done what I believed to be in best interest of boys and will continue to do so.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 08:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 08:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1783 of 4024\nNot to argue but perhaps we do as Dr Brown said, “disagree on the past, focus on the future”\nAgree, this has all been your plan. I have no influence at all. Do you think it’s going pretty well so far?\nNot fighting, just suggesting some reflection. I think both things could be thoughtfully considered.\nHope this lands in the spirit it is intended which is child focused solutions for their mental health.\nI’m not expecting a debate. I was not even expecting a response. I said “we are both on board together”.\nThanks!\nSent:03/01/2024 at 08:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1784 of 4024\nHey- If you could let me know the answer to at least the Sonos questions tomorrow it would be great. Ideally I could get the sub from the computer\ncloset after or at the game. It’s still in its box I think. It’s heavy though, so I do not mind grabbing it myself under your close supervision. I’m just\nblocked again trying to rebuild stuff. I really appreciate it. Thanks!\nAnd my offer to help still stands!!\nSent:03/01/2024 at 10:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>",
