Whatever makes you feel better!\nSent:03/16/2024 at 05:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 05:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nMessage 2192 of 4024\nHey-\nI’m not getting a courtesy response anymore so I realize there is no way I’m getting these back in real life. It’s been a couple months, probably 30\nemails, and many promises of “today” “this week”, etc...that you were going to give them to me.\nSo it’s clear you won’t take a moment from your social life to let me get them under your supervision outside the house. That’s fine, but I’m done\nplaying Charlie Brown to your Lucy. So to help our relationship out I’m going to just buy brand new.\nOne is the sub, that’s about $800. And the other three are play 5 speakers (the only ones I bought) which run around $800 each. I’ll attach the cart\nand price info. So when we start splitting things you keep those, and I’ll keep these. It’s $3.3k and we are even.\nJust documenting because the replacement cost on these ten year old speakers is a fortune. But that’s the only way to do this unless I can find another\nangry but reasonable ex-wife who wont give them back but is willing to sell for the 1k they are worth.\nHope we can get along now.\nThanks!\nSent:03/16/2024 at 09:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 01:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sonos..\nAttachments:IMG_2004.PNG (660 KB)",
