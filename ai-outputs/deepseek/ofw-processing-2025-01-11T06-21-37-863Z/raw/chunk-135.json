  "text": "Message 1978 of 4024\nI will check with Lisa. But, as mentioned on several occasions now, you and Annalisa need to file the correct RO. I have said this many times before.\nChecking prior to that does not help.\nYou own Andy. You are telling him that we will follow our RO and PP just as you said, and I quoted you on several times in the 21 emails that I\ndocumented below that is now up to 30.\nWhy didn't you check with me instead of saying, \"I thought you would coordinate,\" and then step in? I did coordinate. It was my day. I showed you I\ncoordinated the conversation with Adrian after you came home. You knew I had done that. If you did not understand, you should ask me instead of\nsaying I didn't do it when I sent you a report of me doing it.\nI get the feeling that you are perhaps too busy to have a meaningful conversation. You honestly don't seem to be able to remember or understand\nsomething that is written right below what you are replying to. I don't say this as an insult. I say it out of concern for you. I am sincerely worried at\nthis stage and wonder what is going on. Are you noting this in your work at all?\nI honestly am not trying to bash you. We have been together for three decades. If we need to pump the brakes and figure out what is going on I am\nfully supportive. Everyone needs you to be mentally healthy, resilient, and in a sound state of mind. If you want to have a very peaceful, non-\ncontroversial conversation, I and happy to discuss. I really want to help. I mean that.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 12:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 12:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1979 of 4024\nYou have noted on many occasions your ongoing documentation.\nGiven that threat I am going to step away from anything that I perceive you are documenting for leverage in the future to portray me in a bad light.\nGood luck.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 12:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 12:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1980 of 4024\nThat is not my intention at all! I don’t want anything like that documented. I am asking about you sincerely. If you can give me five minutes we can\ndiscuss all of this and stop the back and forth. Please let’s do that. This has taken two full half days. It’s not fair to either of us. And I will put it in\nwriting- this is not a threat!\nSent:03/08/2024 at 12:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 01:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.
