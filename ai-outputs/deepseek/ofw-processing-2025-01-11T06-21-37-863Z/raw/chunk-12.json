  "text": "Message 1558 of 4024\nYou know, July 5 threw me a curveball. That I was so sure would never happen in my lifetime. But I understand your position, I wish you could’ve\ntold me and we worked it out, but I respect you.\nWhat I can’t stand now, is the way our lives have unfolded since we’ve let others dictate our every move. Once so close, so strong, so passionate for\none another. We can’t even talk for two minutes.\nWe should be discussing how we want to creatively divvy things up for longtime financial success. And where we see the boys in five years and how\nwe get them there. And long term co-existence.\nThere is no reason for continuing this horrible, shitty relationship. We have the power to take it back and be kind to each other. we are choosing to\nruin our lives and our kids along with happy and memories.\nI really really hope that someday we can look back on this and give ourselves a score. How we handled it. Were we gracious? Or mean and\nmachiavellian? We are writing the next chapter for Big and Little.\nIs this really how you want it to read in the end?\nI’m always here if you want to try something new...\nSent:02/22/2024 at 06:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 06:36 PM)\nSubject:Bummer..\nMessage 1559 of 4024\nThe last thing I heard was SAAS had requested Adrian's 21/22 transcript from Lakeview. That was on Tuesday, four days ago.\nFeels like we need to nudge for a status update, but I guess that’s your call if this goes the way of the summer camps or not.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 07:44 AM)\nSubject:SAAS\nMessage 1560 of 4024\nSorry I thought I added you to Kristen response. She did that Tuesday.\nThey are in break this week so I assumed they would be back on their review next week.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 07:45 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 07:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS",
