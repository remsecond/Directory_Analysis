  "text": "Message 1793 of 4024\nWe agree. Forgive, don’t forget.\nThe problem is, your whole focus is on retribution. You want to punish me at great expense to the children’s mental health and our relationship.\nI was on a path towards solving the problem as you had asked already. We saw that. It was slow but tracking. You took a different path as iyour\nchoice.\nBut perhaps you should ask yourself if you and the kids are better today than on June 30. Was this really the way to do this? Even if we were getting a\ndivorce.\nPerhaps in our discussion with Dr. Brown it would actually be beneficial for us both to understand the role of punishment and creating a successful\nfuture\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1794 of 4024\nWe have a few outstanding issues we are discussing but you tend to fire off a response and then go dark for 4-12 hours instead of responding. This gets\nfrustrating and creates tension as a result because I don’t get to see my kids or solve issues in a timely manner. I don’t think it’s how you would handle\nan ask from Julie, but that’s your choice.\nBut please understand this is an example that I consider to be poking at me, intentionally making our relationship difficult by refusing to move things\nforward, that keeps me sitting on my hands or missing time with my children. This is not an unfounded criticism. It’s born out of months of\nbehavior. It would also frustrate Julie I’m sure.\nI tried to be very kind yesterday. I recognized you needed space and help. I tried to do that and my offer still stands today. I don’t harbor any ill will.\nBut it makes things hard when you are intentionally counterproductive with most every OFW problem solving interaction.\nYou are smart enough to realize you do this and then tell me you want to see a change. Catch-22, Chinese finger trap, or like they say “the beatings will\ncontinue till morale improves”. It weaponizes what it is supposed to be a safe platform for communication by making it a power play.\nIf this is the only way you will communicate, perhaps step back and understand the damage it does from a neutral perspective. Or we can ask Dr\nBrown. Either way, it goes back to the original issue which is you refuse any professional recommendations to improve our communications.\nJust something to consider as it goes from bad to worse. I’ll save yet another “definition of insanity” quote. You clearly either don’t understand what\nyou were saying for years or are intentionally doing it with malice and forethought. What would you suggest to have constructive communications?\nI’m all ears...\nSent:03/02/2024 at 09:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 09:25 AM)\nSubject:Are you done?",
