  "text": "This is hard for both of us and I’d like to see what you and I can do to reverse course. I’m all ears.\nHave a great night! I wish you the best.\nMessage 1643 of 4024\nI think anyone would read your reply to my ask for help.... yet again, as flat out refusal, yet again.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 07:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1644 of 4024\nAgain... deny what the therapist say. Do your thing, and find blame in others. Dr Brown and Debbie could never be right. Only you are ever right.\nMust be great to be so much godamn smarter than everyone else so you can have an affair, lie about it, and blow up our family with no chance of\nreconciliation and feel good.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 07:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1645 of 4024\nHow do we stop fighting, V? Please? I know you think it’s all me and only me, but I really want to stop it. It’s not healthy for us or the kids. What can\nI do? Without any dialog it seems impossible. But you are so dead set on ‘no talking’ it’s going to be the death of us. I don’t want to browbeat you, but\nplease step outside your plan long enough to reflect on its success and trajectory. It only makes us hate more. It’s not helping.\nI have offered neutral territory. Stupid peaceful engagement ideas. Possible ways to team up on something non controversial. I don’t know what else\nto do, Christine. Please offer anything but the status quo. And please, please don’t just double down yet again. We both say we’re exhausted and want\npeace. I’ll try anything different than this. It’s not a loss for you if we win together and make a positive change.\nI will literally do anything you ask to make this better.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 05:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Stepping Away\nMessage 1646 of 4024\nI was triggered last night.
