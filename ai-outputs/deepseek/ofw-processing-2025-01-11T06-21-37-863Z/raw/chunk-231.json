  "text": "Message 2266 of 4024\nSonos replaced. You keep the ones I tried to get for three months. I also replaced the piece you busted that I told you about weeks ago.\nAttached is what I sent you on 3/16 detailing the cost to replace the three speakers and the sub. I will attach that again for documentation sake.\nI spent the same amount on replacements if you factor in the $100 gift card from the parents of the kids I coach basketball for. Attached.\nSuch a crazy way to spend our $ and the largest community cash outlay by an order of magnitude since I moved in here, but weâ€™re even now.\nSent:03/22/2024 at 04:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/22/2024 at 07:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Sonos..\nAttachments:IMG_2005_1.PNG (534 KB)",
