Bring this up with Dr Brown and how you responded to what you perceived as an attack. And tbh if I did it it does not give you the right\nto attack me like that. You can do it but I can also ignore it.\nThis forum does not allow for disregulation and out reach for issues that are inappropriate and scary to me\nThis is documented here.\nMessage 1549 of 4024\nEvery note you send is a threat. Every thought you have is hateful.\nI’m asking to stop it. Like really stop it for good. Let’s change this.\nFive minutes is safe. We can do it here. Lay down your sword and try.\nYou keep saying it won’t work but are unwilling to give it a try.\nI just want to be peaceful again. I’m not going to ruin that opportunity.\nSent:02/22/2024 at 09:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 10:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: I meant what I said\nMessage 1550 of 4024\n.\nSent:02/22/2024 at 10:04 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/22/2024 at 10:44 AM)\nSubject:Sambica\nAttachments:IMG_1562.PNG (2 MB)\nMessage 1551 of 4024\nI’d like to see Dr Brown feedback after your discussion.
