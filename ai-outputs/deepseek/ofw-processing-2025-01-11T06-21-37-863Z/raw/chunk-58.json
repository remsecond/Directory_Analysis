Thanks again! \nI will never take it as a slight, when you tell me what I need to be doing to keep things in the rails!\nSent:02/27/2024 at 04:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 06:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Default Card\nMessage 1702 of 4024\nSo just so you can feel better, I hope?\n• When you filed for divorce, we were at 4.0M in \"my view\" of fidelity.\n• After everything done so far, we are at 4.6M in \"my view\" of fidelity.\nSo, we have made roughly 1.25M a month since you filed for divorce.\nMy \"panic number\" has been 4.2M, but we keep moving the other way.\nI manage it pretty closely now, as I have shared, to keep it moving up.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 05:31 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 06:06 PM)\nSubject:Our Fidelity Net Worth\nMessage 1703 of 4024\nThank you for the update.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 06:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 06:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Fidelity Net Worth\nMessage 1704 of 4024\nI really have enjoyed the 2nd half our day. In the first half, it was kicking and screaming. But at a point we started to be measured and constructive. It\nmakes all the difference. It does give me hope that something even beyond civility is possible. Thanks so much.\nSent:02/27/2024 at 06:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 06:12 PM)\nSubject:Two Halves to Our Day\nMessage 1705 of 4024\nSent:02/27/2024 at 06:13 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 06:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Two Halves to Our Day",
