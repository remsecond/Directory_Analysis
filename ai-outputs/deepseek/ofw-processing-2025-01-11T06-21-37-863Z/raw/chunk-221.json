Please don’t ignore this mail, please just tell me who they are so I can speak with them.\nSent:03/20/2024 at 04:19 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/20/2024 at 09:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..\nMessage 2226 of 4024\nI did not say crazy.\nI said the therapists we/I have spoken to over course of many years raised serious concerns regarding conduct and safety.\nMe and kids are now engaged with therapists to address the impact on overall mental and emotional wellbeing, how to heal, and how to structure\nfuture support to be safe.\nIn regards to Therapists that raised serious concerns. There was a variation of feedback strongly advising the need for legal police intervention.\nHow to structure plans moving forward is now being directly addressed to ensure complete safety.\nConversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he communicated to her in an honest and open environment was\nincredibly brave and I need to respect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made it clear to me if she believes\nhe is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That is her obligation.\nThis is similar to the obligation Yurishka was put in. You have a different perspective, but professionals have a duty to act when they are made aware\nof certain situations.\nAnnaLisa will be talking to Lisa. How we move forward will be dependent on how you receive the information and what you believe will be in best\ninterest of boys. We will see.\nSent:03/20/2024 at 10:06 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/20/2024 at 10:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: I still do stupid things..",
