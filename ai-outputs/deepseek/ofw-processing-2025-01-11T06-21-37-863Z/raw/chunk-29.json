Thanks for the heads up!\nI’m jealous but happy for you all!\nSent:02/25/2024 at 10:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Amex\nMessage 1618 of 4024\nI got a ping from Rocket Money, but can’t figure out what it is for??? Do all these look right to you? I recognize most but not Hand & Stone?\nI am NOT micromanaging what you sped money on. I know what you always spend on hair, face, nails, massage, cupping. You are my wife. It’s not\nnew.\nI am NOT asking you to stop... well, I guess unless it’s actually being used to be pretty for some other dude while we are still married. That would\nsuper uncool\nSent:02/25/2024 at 12:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 12:50 PM)\nSubject:Alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1627.PNG (811 KB)\nMessage 1619 of 4024\nI want to honestly critique myself during the “prove it “ week. I tried below to explain why I get frustrated and allow you to see my perspective below.\nIt did not seem you got it yesterday.\nIn the future, I’ll try to save those words that might be unnecessary. You have been on the same emails as I have. It’s dumb to poke at you because\nrepeating things that stir emotions.\nI want to go all in this week and see what impact it has. So I will endeavor to bite my tongue and just ask you questions rather than “loading” them up\nwith negative innuendo.\nThe inquiry still stands and I’d like to hear what you think. But please accept my apologies as I am trying to be less passive aggressive and snarky. That\nwill never be helpful.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 12:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 12:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1620 of 4024\nYes hand and stone is me.
