It’s just taking Dr Brown’s advice and living for tomorrow instead of yesterday.\nI known we don’t forget, and actions have consequences. And they have. Terrible ones that are doing awful things to the family. No one will ever\nforget this. But it’s up to you and I what happens now. What’s the life we want?\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and share mine. I’d also like to do something brave that may even be inspiring to our children in ten years. Hating each\nother is the easy route. Getting past our history and thriving in spite of it is hard.\n• How do we want to be remembered?\n• What is our legacy going to be?\nI’d love to talk about that when you are ready...\nSent:03/05/2024 at 06:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 07:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: New Chapter?\nMessage 1891 of 4024\nThanks so much for the package, V!!!\nMuch appreciated.\nSent:03/05/2024 at 11:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 05:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball\nMessage 1892 of 4024\nHey-\nI was trying to continue a thread we had with all the relevant links to the parenting plan we had in it. You can’t do that here.\nSo I sent it and said I’d move back here after I shared. But I don’t know if you are going to acknowledge it or ignore it on email.\nThe two things noted there were:\nWhat’s your thoughts on AD and I getting together?\nHow do you feel about my parenting plan thoughts?\nIt will be much easier if you reply there so you have both the links and the context. I can’t duplicate that on OFW.\nThanks\nSent:03/05/2024 at 11:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 05:11 AM)\nSubject:AD and The Plan",
