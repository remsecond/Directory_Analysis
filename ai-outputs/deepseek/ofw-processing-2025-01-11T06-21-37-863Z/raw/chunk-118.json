This is no different.\nIf you want to make the case it is, and you are forced to burn our community property, that is your choice. We will leave it up to a mediator to sort\nthrough the differences in the SAAS vs Parenting Plan styles.\nI am only documenting my interest in saving the money by working together again and your decision. Please let me know. I’d love to work with you.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 09:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: You Burn Our Money\nMessage 1930 of 4024\nThanks for making the time.\nYesterday I asked for an opportunity for us to have a meeting of the minds and really talk about how we can stop this daily slide into hate and\ndestruction. But now we have urgent issues as well—Andy, RO, and the Parenting Plan.\nSo are we going to work on what happens in the Emergency Room, or are we going to discuss if we need to start wearing a seat belt? I'd prefer that we\nput on the seat belt, but we have patients bleeding out in the emergency room.\nI hope you will thoughtfully consider the ongoing impact of saying you are \"just not ready\" to put on the seatbelt. We have created a prison of our\nown making and are paying the price. Hint: adding more locks and layers won't help.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 10:04 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Running List for 10:30\nMessage 1931 of 4024\n.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 10:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:I’m on\nMessage 1932 of 4024\nAre we talking?
