But it NEVER helps. Not a single time has it helped ever. So, I\nmight suggest in the spirit of working constructively working together is we stop that?\nThe person saying the words know what they are really saying. Telling them that they are \"basically\" saying something that they did not, but fits our\nown narrative, spins us down a counterproductive rabbit hole. It is always pointless.\nShould we stop?\nSent:02/27/2024 at 08:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 09:22 AM)\nSubject:Helpful Suggestion\nMessage 1686 of 4024\nGiven that everything has to go through here or attorneys now, we might be screwed this week. I assume Anna Lisa sent you the asks from last week",
