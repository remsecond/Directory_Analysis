  "text": "Message 1944 of 4024\nSent you the details in our other thread. Sorry for typos, I just dictated it so I could go into more detail. Just let me know if you have any questions...\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lori\nMessage 1945 of 4024\nOk. So not confirmed he will start Monday. Regardless his first day will be half day.\nAny discussion on study skills class or bus?\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:29 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lori\nMessage 1946 of 4024\nIn your other email you noted we would ignore the RO and parenting plan? I intend to follow both.\nI believe Andy could be helpful in establishing protocols for communication, as my experience it will breakdown. Your call.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1947 of 4024\nNot really. She said they were off tomorrow, but that did not mean the people working the problem will not be working. So it’s entirely possible they\ncould reach out to us to onboard him. It was just the tone of the conversation and the reality of the IT challenges that led me to believe it was highly\nunlikely. She did not know about study skills or bus yet because he is not in the system so it’s difficult to know.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lori\nMessage 1948 of 4024\nI think that’s why I would like to talk with you instead of doing this broken thread between OFW and email.\nHis plan clearly does not include the com methods we established in either of the RO or parenting plan.\nCan we just chat. This will be impossible.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy",
