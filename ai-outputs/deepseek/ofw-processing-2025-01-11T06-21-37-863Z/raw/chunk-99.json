If we are intellectually honest with each other, we are doing things to get things done already;\nI'm just in danger.\n1-1 FYI, emails with inline comments seem like a no-brainer. We have AD basketball camp, SAAS state tournament, and Mark's AMEX that all fit\nthat bill recently.\nPlain 1-1 emails with you where we drop a 3rd party seem incredibly useful but are not allowed either. We really needed that yesterday to act on SAAS\nquickly.\nEmergency OFW calls are a no-brainer. SAAS was urgent enough for you to reach out to me immediately. I need the same option if you are just not\navailable.\nI hope you see none of these are a threat to your safety. I do not abuse them. They allow for common sense communications to be more effective co-\nparents.\nLet's please not turn this into a counterproductive scoreboard exercise. If you allow us the means to communicate in a timely and effective way, it will\nwork wonders.\nThanks for your consideration...\n-robert\nSent:03/05/2024 at 07:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 07:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Attached Inline and Urgent\nMessage 1852 of 4024\nThat is fine, but your instructions to me to do you a favor really come across as an order like I work a minimum wage job for you.
