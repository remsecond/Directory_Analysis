I will pull together what I have booked so far and will\nshare.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 03:45 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 03:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Local Hoops\nMessage 2139 of 4024\nI have repeatedly said that I was not on board with your Cabo plans that would give you three vacations with them in a row. You have been aware of\nthat for months now so buying tickets is immaterial to me. This totals to 3 for Mom and 0 for Dad since July.\nKids, I acknowledge your assertion. I plan on following a Parenting Plan. We are supposed to have a temporary one in place immediately following\nyour divorce filing. Today, after working with child-focused professionals, I have shared five with you in six months.\nCabo Time Share- wrt community property, this turn is mine. You canceled my October trip when we agreed to make plans for Elsa's wedding. It was\nmy turn then, so we don't just skip me. You also went to Hong Kong and Universal Studios as a secret surprise to me.\nHappy to review the proposed summer schedule. That sounds like a proposal to work together.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 05:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 09:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Local Hoops\nMessage 2140 of 4024\nUpdate\n$ 3.60m- left job\n$ 4.03m- divorce\n$ 4.61m- today\nThis is after supporting our full burn rate, along with the astronomical costs associated with your decision.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 07:05 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 09:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Our Fidelity Net Worth\nAttachments:IMG_1919.PNG (304 KB)\nMessage 2141 of 4024\nThe email below is a demonstration again of your lack of comprehension of what transpired and impact of your actions to me and children.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 09:32 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 09:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: Local Hoops",
