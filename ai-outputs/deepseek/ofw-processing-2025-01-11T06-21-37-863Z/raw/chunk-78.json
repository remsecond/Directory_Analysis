I can go pick up dry cleaning or\nhelp you with some shopping. I can also just be a friendly ear and talk through work issues and ignore all this nonsense. I have some background there\nand some experience that I’m always happy to share with you as you know.\nPlease help me help you. I mean that sincerely.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 01:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 01:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visitation\nMessage 1769 of 4024\nI want to be super clear about this offer to help. Just because it's the weekend does not mean that the work goes away. Even if it is paused. And I\nwould hate to have you stressed during your limited time away.\nSo... I noted some offers below. But it stands for the whole weekend till you get caught up. Short of you going on a date, if you just give me a todo list\nfor the kids, errands or tasks I will work it in and execute w/o discussion.\nWe were a solid team once, and we can put the drama aside for a weekend and work together. We are still married and should help one another. I'll\nquit bugging you about this stuff, too. I'll even book you a foot massage!\nFor all my faults and trespasses, you know I liked to pamper and spoil you. Please let me know.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 02:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 04:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visitation\nMessage 1770 of 4024\nDid you want to have Adrian hang with you tomorrow after basketball?
