Was there an issue if you wanted to actually do\nit or not, or did we drop the ball?\nSent:03/11/2024 at 11:07 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 11:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2102 of 4024\nNo idea.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 11:11 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 11:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2103 of 4024\nOk. I'll ask so we can both address it with some constructive feedback.\nA three-week delay on simple paperwork is not trivial. At the rates we pay them, I expect better in the interest of our children. It also concerns me that\nother things may be \"lurking\" that we may not even be aware of. Things that may be of more severe consequence than this. Who knows.\nAs we like to say \"If you can't nail the simple things, how do I expect you to get the big things right.?\"\nSent:03/11/2024 at 11:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 11:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2104 of 4024\nThey called. Meeting tomorrow at 12:45-1:45 with Adrian. Iâ€™ll get email later today.
