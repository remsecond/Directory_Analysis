  "text": "Message 2068 of 4024\nWhat time would you like to chat? I’m going to ask that we allocate the necessary time to do this justice. History tells us it’s time boxed for failure.\nIt’s a big deal that’s critical to the kid’s mental health that has drug on for months now. Let’s please make it matter when we discuss later and don’t cut\nit short.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 01:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 02:16 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2069 of 4024\nIn thinking through it’s actually not a good idea to discuss. We will disagree.\nI’m talking to my lawyer tomorrow for my edits.\nI don’t think talking about it will save money and will probably cause more ill will.\nAn RO was filed based on your conduct. This required limitations to time with kids.\nYou have now said if I truly believe it file charges.\nA condition of the RO and not DV protection order was you admitting the behaviour.\nI hear you will be denying it.\nPlease confirm and I will file charges as requested.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 02:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 02:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2070 of 4024\nWow... we went from working constructively together to you filing charges so I can never work again. How did that happen? May you please turn on\ncalls for one moment. Your threats and actions out of nowhere when we were making great progress are certainly urgent. Let’s please not do this over",
