  "text": "have been impossible to track. And we would never have known what the other was responding to or had read. Let's please not create even more\nbarriers to constructive co-parenting. Thanks!\nMessage 1882 of 4024\nI see the call is at 3:15. I will update our Teams meeting accordingly and see you at 3:00.\nI also want to continue our working relationship the way we have done the last couple of days and correct what just happened. So I will propose the\nfollowing guidelines designed to help us be more respectful so we can have a constructive dialogue that limits triggering each other. And if it happens\nanyway, despite this, I am proposing we note that and ask for a resolution of either stopping the conversation or giving the other a chance to correct\nor reconcile the triggering action. We need to afford each other the opportunity to course correct a mistake.\nPlease consider these suggestions.\n• Respectful Tone: Speak as if to your boss, respectfully and thoughtfully as if you might get fired.\n• No Recap's: Allow each person to express their thoughts without interruption or a \"playback.\"\n• No Abrupt Endings: Don't end conversations suddenly after disagreements. Ask for an apology first.\n• Listen Actively: Show you're listening without interrupting, using nods or brief acknowledgments.\n• Use \"I\" Statements: Say \"I feel...\" instead of \"you make me...\" to express personal feelings without blame.\n• Pause Before Responding: Take a moment to think before replying to provide more thoughtful responses.\n• Avoid Assumptions: Don't assume intentions or feelings; ask for clarification and limit predetermination.\n• Stay on Topic: Focus on the current issue without bringing up unrelated past grievances. Note if it happens.\n• Respect Boundaries: If someone needs a break, respect it. Agree on when to continue the conversation.\n• Use Neutral Language: Be factual and use non-inflammatory words to keep the discussion productive.\nDo you agree? Can we do this in a calm way and ask each other to follow these together?\nSent:03/05/2024 at 02:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 02:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Before Dr Brown\nMessage 1883 of 4024\nOk.
