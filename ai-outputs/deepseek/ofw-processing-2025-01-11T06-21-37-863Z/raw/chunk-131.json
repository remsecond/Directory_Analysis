I’ll see timing from AnnaLisa. I’m in back to back 10-4.\nAndy: see last email. I did not confirm and suggest you connect with Lisa to confirm not in violation.\nSonos: I did not go to back porch to check if everything is down. I’ll do so when I get home. If yes, I’ll bring to basketball.\nSent:03/08/2024 at 09:28 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 09:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 1966 of 4024\nYou rock! Thanks for the quick turnaround. You have gotten so much better at this and I can’t tell you what a difference it makes in issue resolution.\nNo wonder we got so much accomplished this week.\n• RO & PP: does that mean we update your RO to get it right and send it to Annalisa? Just want to confirm so i don’t ruffle “turf feathers” Can you\nreview after meetings? I know you are busy but I’d love to close after all these months.\n• Andy: if we do send back and you and Annalisa will approve the RO as mentioned, we can make progress. Agree we’re dead in the water with the\nwrong one filed. Do you want to let him know we are a go after that and plan to follow our RO and PP ?\n• Sonos: Thanks for helping to stop this from dragging on. I assume you found my Sub? Even if you bring the other stuff and take a pic of the back\nSent:03/08/2024 at 09:40 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/08/2024 at 09:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.
