I’ll get this in on time of course\nSent:02/28/2024 at 07:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/28/2024 at 07:21 AM)\nSubject:Random UA\nAttachments:IMG_1679.PNG (309 KB)\nMessage 1712 of 4024\nHey, it was great to hear about how your team's been handling all the recent challenges, especially with everything changing so much. Sounds like\neven with Linda shaking things up a bit, you guys are getting the spotlight you’ve worked so hard for. It’s been a long time coming, hasn’t it? I know\nthis might be a bit of a hard stretch, but looking back, I you’ll see it's all been worth it. You’ve got a knack for making the most out of every situation,\nand I’m confident you’re going to shine, and the team will come out the other side even stronger. Even though things are changing between us, I’m\nstill super proud of you. Christine, you’re something special.\nSent:02/28/2024 at 08:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/28/2024 at 08:26 AM)\nSubject:Wishng You a Wonderful Day\nMessage 1713 of 4024\nI just got my recent bill...\nLisa is almost doing nothing, and it's still a few k. Not sure about yours. I hope we get to the point where we are not paying another mortgage every\nmonth, but I understand your situation so am not complaining. It's just painful...   Looking forward to a better way.\nSent:02/28/2024 at 08:49 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/28/2024 at 04:21 PM)\nSubject:Attorney Cost\nMessage 1714 of 4024\nAnna Lisa has these btw.
