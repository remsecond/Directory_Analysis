But please see\nattached. Sometimes it just makes me do it. Usually for light or when I have eaten fruit. It’s not intentional however. Just wanted to share because you\nhave mentioned it before so wanted reassure you that it is necessary.\nThanks!\nSent:03/02/2024 at 05:55 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:15 AM)\nSubject:SoberLink\nAttachments:IMG_1725.PNG (745 KB)\nMessage 1786 of 4024\nI forwarded you some info and thoughts yesterday about perhaps taking AD to this SAAS state boys basketball event. He is super interested.\nCan we continue there or do we need to capture all that info here and recreate the discussion again so you and I can discuss? Just let me know.\nThanks\nSent:03/02/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:07 AM)\nSubject:SAAS boys state tournament\nMessage 1787 of 4024\nThank you for sharing\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:15 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:15 AM)\nSubject:Re: SoberLink\nMessage 1788 of 4024\nI had Xfinity’s at house after surveillance incident to walk through everything. Once I understood I pulled out what was not needed to make space.\nFor the Sonos I just snipped the black tie that held it in.no damage was done prior to removal.\nI pulled all Sonos speakers I was aware with exception of one in the porch mailbox. It would not open. I’ll look for speaker in computer closet and\nbring it if I can locate it.\nIf you want any of old computers to start breaking them down just let me know\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>",
