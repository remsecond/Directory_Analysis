  "text": "Message 1664 of 4024\nBy the way, it really hurt my feelings that you said I took everything. That makes me feel really bad. And I had hoped we would discuss it with the kids\nbefore it looked like I was stealing all the Kirkland stuff. You and I had agreed on the list to be sure it was fair.\nI think I took the couch and two chairs . I think you kept all the other big furniture in the whole house. I also took the bed at your suggestion, but\ngave you the beach bed. Then I took the outdoor furniture that you don’t use at all, no one does. And I got a bunch of junk from the beach but\noffered it to you first.\nI thought that was consistent with what we had agreed to. I was in no way trying to screw you at all. I thought we did some edits and updates by\nswapping things back-and-forth like the bed and the TV in the spirit of cooperation. I thought it was fair.\nThen I purchased a pit group from Amazon that was cheap and everything else has been consignment shopping or craigslist. I don’t like the image\nthat I have just stolen everything against your wishes.\nPlease let me know how we can resolve that situation if you feel like I’ve done something unfair. But also, please remember that dad‘s house is the boys\nhouse too. We just don’t have a parenting plan in place.\nWhat do you want back?\n-robert\nSent:02/26/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 08:02 PM)\nSubject:Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1665 of 4024\nYou asked to take the table and guest bedroom  so I would have been left with the big couch and coffee table and kids and I bed.\nYou took the tvs off the walls and gave me two tvs that didn’t even work or fit in the brackets.\nIm keeping this short at Dr Brown advice and don’t care to go back and forth.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 08:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 09:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1666 of 4024\nExample of you getting upset at me when you gestured I come down, visibly frustrated then telling me to come down.\nIt’s not even like I have a reason or choice, just straight into do it my way or I will get annoyed and angry.\nThere is a reason I prefer not to.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 08:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 09:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: What are you doing?",
