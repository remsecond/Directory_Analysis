  "text": "Message 2188 of 4024\nDo you know how they work? How do you know sending you a factual data measurement is inflammatory? You can ignore all real world facts- speed\nlimits, property lines, price tags, luggage weight. It’s your call.\nBut I’m not sure it shows anything more than the fact you just don’t understand how it works. If you would like me to explain, it’s a brain dead\nsimple trigger. Or you can just ignore it. Happy to help though. Honestly!\nSent:03/16/2024 at 05:27 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 05:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nMessage 2189 of 4024\nYou should not have inserted the original commentary as it was intended to poke.

I am just trying to verify. I wonder if it’s because we are priced in a legacy rate? Sort of like how we benefit from\nour interest rate and we pay so much less for more expensive home. I can ask him for an estimate.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 05:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Home Services <<Not Urgent>>",
