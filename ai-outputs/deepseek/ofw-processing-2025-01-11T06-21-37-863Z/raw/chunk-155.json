You left the family plan for no reason other than perhaps you don’t\nunderstand, but whatever. I don’t want to pay for you twice. Thanks!\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:27 AM)\nSubject:Apple Family Plan\nMessage 2042 of 4024\nThe BofA is a joint account. I thought you still have access. Let me know how I can help.\nAgree I think it’s cobra but they won’t talk to me anymore. I believe they are waiting for the  paperwork I sent you for the refund.\nThank you for looking into this.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:27 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:27 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2043 of 4024\nI have no issue granting you access or the passwords. We have discussed I think. I also think I sent the paperwork in a while back. Perhaps that is why\nNov is so low. I’ll check to be sure.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:29 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\nMessage 2044 of 4024\nWhat is left? Happy to do so.\nAgree we need a financial plan in place to start looking at separate expenses, child maintenance and spousal support.\nI’ll start pulling together docs I have.\nLet’s align on docs we need to see our full picture. We will need to share W2’s, tax returns, investment account statements  etc. perhaps we start a\nshared drive to compile together then submit to our lawyers. I think I have most of it.\nI know we want to be fair on both sides.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 10:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 10:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Apple Family Plan",
