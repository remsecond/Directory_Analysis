  "text": "Message 2193 of 4024\nSo i didn’t get to discuss how I could be involved in Max’s life this weekend. Even though I signed up for a school event that you took over, leveraging\nthe RO. That was a bummer that I thought we could resolve after we cleared the air yesterday. You did not.\nThis afternoon I would like to see Adrian since it’s been well over a week since we have had time together. But you count skiing w/ him as work, that\nis not “quality time”. Unlike my coaching. And I have no way to discuss as you don’t answear OFW anymore.\nAnother week passes. Another week of complete and utter parental alienation. I understand in your mind it’s justified and even though we were all\namazing together before you started this. Somehow this transition to “no father figure” is healthy parenting.\nSent:03/17/2024 at 12:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/17/2024 at 01:39 PM)\nSubject:You are past the 20 hour mark on OFW",
