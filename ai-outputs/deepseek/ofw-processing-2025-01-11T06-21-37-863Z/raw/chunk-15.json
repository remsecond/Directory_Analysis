But I will note that to a person, every single one of the mental health professionals have seem to this point say I need\nto practice radical acceptance and move on with my life. I can appreciate that.\nBut equally consistent is that you have a lot of stored trauma and you are dealing with it as best you can, but it definitely would have been better for\nus to tackle it together, through therapy, prior to reaching the point of no return.\nThere was always the possibility we could have saved the Moyer’s if we had only tried CPR. But we didn’t.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 01:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 02:54 PM)\nSubject:Mental Health Professionals\nMessage 1570 of 4024\nI am not sure Adrian is ready for the overnight not am I comfortable at this time.\nIf you want to take him to the sneaker convention after basketball I am fine.

And I do trust your judgment. But please review the parenting plan update.\nThe only change to visitation for AD is the formalized addition for one weekly day time visit. She says there is no issue with the original schedule.\nI am really hoping with this last pass we have fine tuned and can move forward in a positive way. I really will make all the effort you allow to be kind.\nThanks!\nSent:02/23/2024 at 03:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 03:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform",
