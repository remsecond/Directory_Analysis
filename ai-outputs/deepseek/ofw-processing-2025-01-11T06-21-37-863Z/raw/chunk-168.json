  "text": "Message 2084 of 4024\nSounds good!\nMaybe we can work on some of that together. I am not going to engage you in the mudslinging and an accusations. I do not believe it benefits anyone.\nBut I do appreciate you acknowledging I had turned everything around and was the father and husband you asked me to be. It really felt great tbh!\nAnd I honestly don’t see any issue trying to be friends given my demonstrated changes prior to July 5th. I don’t know why they say you should hate\nme.\nBut we are where we are. I wish you the best. And am looking forward to a healthy child centered discussion rather than a retribution based\nnegotiation.\nThanks!!!\nSent:03/10/2024 at 05:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 06:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Parenting Plan\nMessage 2085 of 4024\nLet me know if it’s better for you to start earlier.
