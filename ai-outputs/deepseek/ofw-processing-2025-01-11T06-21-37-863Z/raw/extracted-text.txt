Also- below is exactly what we agreed to do with Dr Brown. That is what I keep asking you. You keep saying she is going to do as we asked, over and
over you say that. But then you say she is going to adjust the Parenting Plan. That's not what we asked. That was one very small part of this that may
or may not be necessary. It makes me feel like you think I am so fucking stupid that I don't understand. I can read two things and see if they are or are
not alike. Adrian can do that.
Are we doing what we asked her to or not? Full stop. Nothing else. Are we doing the below?
____________________________________________________________________________
Here is what we have agreed to:
Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.
Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
way we handled it.
Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our
parenting plan if necessary.
How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being
formally approved. So TBD.

You know, July 5 threw me a curveball. That I was so sure would never happen in my lifetime. But I understand your position, I wish you could’ve
told me and we worked it out, but I respect you.
What I can’t stand now, is the way our lives have unfolded since we’ve let others dictate our every move. Once so close, so strong, so passionate for
one another. We can’t even talk for two minutes.
We should be discussing how we want to creatively divvy things up for longtime financial success. And where we see the boys in five years and how
we get them there. And long term co-existence.
There is no reason for continuing this horrible, shitty relationship. We have the power to take it back and be kind to each other. we are choosing to
ruin our lives and our kids along with happy and memories.
I really really hope that someday we can look back on this and give ourselves a score. How we handled it. Were we gracious? Or mean and

Greetings Christine- I have met with Dr Brown as you requested and hope this follows all the OFW guidelines that have been outlined. Please advise if
they do not.
Elapsed time: 1 day and 6 hours
I asked if I could take AD to Sneaker Con. I have his newly authenticated shoes here if he would like to take them and swap, bargain, or sell them
based on their authenticity. It will definitely let him feel like a real "player" with skin in the game. That's what this is about.
Ideally, I could come grab him this afternoon, we shoot and eat dinner, he spends the night, and I have him back after sneaker con. It is a gorgeous
day. I have been asking for weeks now and the prerequisite for seeing me has been met and time together has been approved.
Thanks for your thoughtful consideration as my Co-Parent.

We are where we are. It’s too bad. But I will note that to a person, every single one of the mental health professionals have seem to this point say I need
to practice radical acceptance and move on with my life. I can appreciate that.
But equally consistent is that you have a lot of stored trauma and you are dealing with it as best you can, but it definitely would have been better for
us to tackle it together, through therapy, prior to reaching the point of no return.
There was always the possibility we could have saved the Moyer’s if we had only tried CPR. But we didn’t.

The only change to visitation for AD is the formalized addition for one weekly day time visit. She says there is no issue with the original schedule.
I am really hoping with this last pass we have fine tuned and can move forward in a positive way. I really will make all the effort you allow to be kind.
Thanks!

Ok. Thanks! Appreciate the update. I trust you.
Feel free to include me in decisions so you don’t have to be the gatekeeper for “Adrian access” now that we have a plan again. I’m more than happy to
engage like I’m actually his dad. I would have offered him to come play NCAA for a couple hours since it was his Xmas gift and he has not had it for
six weeks.

Please make sure you get it on Adrian‘s knee as quickly as possible. If he is not able to come to practice, he should have that iced to prevent further
swelling and irritation that will limit the time to heal.
I am more than happy to sit and explain to you when you use heat and when you use cold to help get you better in the case of soft tissue issues.
Treating it properly as soon as possible makes a big difference.

The irreparable harm done over the last seven weeks is devastating. It has literally torn the Moyer family apart and cast reputations asunder. Just think
about if we had done this the next day, instead of now, given the result and recommendations. There is a lesson to be learned.
"Justice delayed is justice denied" and we both got the justice we wanted so would you like to discuss next steps, or should I assume we are back into
the plan as recommended as a stopgap till the attorneys do their thing? Just let me know if you want to discuss here or by phone.
We both have crazy bitterness for the way this transpired, festered, and destroyed us as a family, just to end up here. Even though she was crazy hard
on me today, it is clear that if nothing changed except for fostering hate and distrust for a month and a half, we missed the mark.
Given we are both parents forever (co? parallel? fuck all?) to our kids, I hope we refer to her thoughtful words as we make decisions and consider their
best interests moving forward. What a total fucked up goat rodeo this was and the relationships it destroyed for me, are very real.
Please let me know if you are going to make time. I assure you I'll be peaceful and constructive.

You know we got Dr. Brown’s parenting plan back yesterday. Afterwards you checked out and I assume I won’t hear back from you till you get
around to it in the morning. You can make up any excuse that you want, but you got exactly what you asked for and now you’re kind of being a bit of
a weenie. Just like when she told us last Saturday that I could see Adrian and it took you days to get back to me.
You can pretend like you don’t know what you’re doing but no one would buy it. It didn’t serve you well this time and it’s not gonna serve you well
next time. At some point, you actually have to put the children first as Dr Brown or the next court appointed facilitator will do and quit thinking of
yourself. Obviously, I’m documenting a consistent pattern going back to October for one thing or another.
I’ve always had 50-50 custody of our kids but you block me at every move from seeing them since it is not “on strategy” with Anna Lisa as you told
Debbie and she reminded me of. Even when I’ve done every thing you asked- blow test, meetings, dna analysis (not your bullshit hair test) your
freaking RO, that says I credibly will beat my kids.wtf is that?
At some point an adult will seethis Christine. One did yesterday. The difference next time is that you will have a proven track record of obstructionist
bullshit to go along with it to reinforce you are a shitty mom who is focusing on deflecting blame. Just like you did for blowing up our family, or
being inappropriate with Kevin Otero and lying about it.
I wish I could respect your journey and feel like it had some merit, even if misguided. But it does not. You lie, cheat, and blame everyone but yourself.
I actually feel bad for you. It’s a sign of someone who can’t cope with their own actions and needs it to be someone else’s fault. Always. Always.
Always. The reason you hate me, is I call it out.
Good luck with that! Hope he makes you feel better about yourself and tells you that you are always right.

He FaceTimed me to ask when we could get together and see the house this AM. I told him this is the plan:
- Team pictures- I think 10:30
- Break- give him some gifts
- Game- he likely can’t play
- House- visit and give shoes
- Con- head over for sneakers
He reached out to me on his walk where he felt safe and let me know he really wants to see me today.
I hope that’s not a problem and we begin the plan today, just like we did last time- the very next day.

We owe it to both our kids to be able to have frank discussions about them at this point in their lives. Today was a blast. Amazing. And thank you so
much for letting me do sneaker con. That meant a lot to both of us.
But also, I noticed a lot of social anxiety and behaviors in him that I would like to be able to openly discuss with you. You can blame it on me, but will
never know if that’s really the issue and you can’t blame everything bad on me without giving me credit for some of the good.
But either way, till they are out of our house, you and I owe it to them to be able to have a dialogue in their best interest. We are the parents . We
should be working as a team together regardless of how we feel about each other, we should unite in their best interest.
We really need to start getting over ourselves or at least compartmentalized to the point where we can do them justice in their childhood. I think after
all that was the point of you doing all of this. So if we can stop blaming each other and start putting them first, I will work constructively with you on
that.

enjoyed dinner and each other’s company.
None of it would be possible without your blessing. You had one very happy little man yesterday. And his Daddy was pretty damn pleased himself! I
always called you “super mom”when we were the Moyer family, and yesterday you totally earned the crown again! It was awesome!
I’d love to hear if he likes his place. I want Max and AD to have fun in the “boys getaway” I tried to make for them. I hope it’s a good place for sleep

due.
I also just got a notice that 500 cash was transferred from the joint Bank of America account to an Apple Pay account. I assume that was you.

Thanks for the helpful explanation.
Fidelity- what did I cut off? You never had access is what I understood. Please let me know.
AMEX- it’s like the phone or Xfinity right? I don’t care. Big deal. We are married. I did not know you just quit paying the bill. And I asked you to tell
me if so. Can you please resume that until we are final?
Apple Cash- yes, of course. The Sneaker Con had no internet. And no way to pay for things other than that. So AD got two pairs of shoes, and a T-
shirt he really wanted. I hope that is not an issue. See attached.
Fidelity Account- yes, I do have access and I can pay from there but it’s not set up to, I would need yet another account for that. It won’t do bill pay.
We agreed nothing would change. But you did. I even have $20k in review from a transfer I sent Friday so we would continue to operate as we had
agreed.
This is the only way to communicate you allow. So we will continue to find out what you are not doing after the fact, while I continue what I said I
would do.
Even this exchange should have cost us 1k for our attorneys to do over a month because Anna Lisa is slow and imprecise. You know that by now.
If this explanation is simply too long for you to understand, it’s unfortunate. Details matter. I’m trying to work with, especially during our test week.

So.... I don’t want to inflame things. That is not my intention. Especially during our “prove it week” 
As you will see however, almost a month ago I brought up suggestions to improve both our working relationship and co-parenting effectiveness.
You said:
Let Anna Lisa know that I don’t beat my kids and you saying it is probably inappropriate. Seems like she, as your lawyer, would tell you that too, but
whatever.
I should propose a more appropriate form of communication to help us, but be cognizant of your sincere and justified concerns. So I did in detail.
We were on path to improve everything for a full week until you met with Anna Lisa and it went “poof” up in smoke. No change whatsoever. Back to
this.
The next week we were doing well, but you asked for patience daily and even thanked me for affording you that. Till the next Friday again. And then
“Poof”
You get mad that my frustration manifests here. I am letting you know when you say “yes” and actions show “no” it makes things worse for this
situation.
You say “you have to prove it first” while you poke me week after week. And get upset by my response to your contradictory behavior. It’s super
frustrating.
So despite you agreeing and then ignoring exactly what you asked me to do, I’m going to try one last time to break our catch-22 and make progress.
I’d like to share my thoughts ahead of time in an effort to take this back and as Dr Brown loosely said, “agree to disagree, quit fighting, and focus on
the future.”
Every mental health professional has had awful, awful thoughts on divorce lawyers. Can you and I hammer out what “WE” believe is best for our kids
here? 
I’ll share, please block 10 minutes this weekend to review. And let me know how we move it forward.

I want to honestly critique myself during the “prove it “ week. I tried below to explain why I get frustrated and allow you to see my perspective below.
It did not seem you got it yesterday.
In the future, I’ll try to save those words that might be unnecessary. You have been on the same emails as I have. It’s dumb to poke at you because
repeating things that stir emotions.
I want to go all in this week and see what impact it has. So I will endeavor to bite my tongue and just ask you questions rather than “loading” them up
with negative innuendo.
The inquiry still stands and I’d like to hear what you think. But please accept my apologies as I am trying to be less passive aggressive and snarky. That
will never be helpful.

So you get busy now till the end of the week. I’ll get really frustrated when you don’t find time, so I’m just gonna propose something that I’m gonna
send to Lisa. But I would like your approval at least for Phase II
Note this is the fourth time I’ve had to type this up. I am really frustrated with OFW.  It fucking sucks.
I would like to propose amendments to the restraining order in a phased approach. They include all the standard language about civility, decency, and
kindness applying to topics around the kids and/or our fiscal situation. No change to that part.
Proposal to assure your concerns are met:
- OFW
Phase I - now we try to do everything here, it sucks
Phase II - next RO, allow emergency/urgent OFW calls
Phase III - use OFW for documentation purposes
- Email
Phase I - now I am a bystander not a participant
Phase II - next RO, allow forwarding of fyi emails
Phase III- tbd? allow for inline/normal emails
- Text
Phase I - now, nothing allowed
Phase II - I’d like emergency/urgent texts
Phase III - tbd? return to normal text communication
- Calls
Phase I - now, nothing allowed
Phase II - I’d like emergency/urgent calls
Phase III - tbd? return to normal text communication
Ideally, we can agree that we could move forward with Phase II suggestions, if we both agree, via an email from Lisa to Annalisa on Monday. Then
when she fixes the wrong RO she can make the change one time.
Just like we were doing with Dr. Brown, if we do not adhere to the guidelines provided we revert back to the prior phase. This will incentivize us to
both make it work and be constructive and helpful moving forward.
Whatever you do, I am asking you please to take the 10 minutes we spoke of earlier today, spend it on this,
think about it, and let me know. I hope this is a reasonable compromise that you feel good about.
Please give me a call for 5 min if you have concerns.
Thanks! 
Message 1626 of 4024

Dr Brown was clear that in her opinion OFW should be the forum we use given the history. I am open to OFW calls for emergencies.
One week is not long enough to show a demonstrated ability to address my concerns and real fears for safety. You have continued to downplay the
impact 25 years of aggression and coercion has had on me. Even in person the level of aggression and anger is palpable.
Not having texts/calls have been such a huge relief to me.
The emails with 3rd party and fyi make sense to me.
I also need to address the pictures you brought up. The language you used to highlight you had them was scary and threatening to me. The specificity
of referencing details in the pictures was shocking, to drive home the point. It was the same type of language you used with the boys. It’s alarming and
used to scare. I do not believe they have been destroyed and fear they will be used as retribution in the future.
Message 1627 of 4024
Thank you! I really appreciate the response and will not push you for anything you are not comfortable with. This is a great start. And I am happy to
prove this will work. I hope we share a desire to get back to normalcy with a track record.
I don’t have a way to downplay or even discuss the 25 years. I have asked to learn more about your feelings but you refuse. I have apologized and asked
for feedback on what to change but we never can talk about it. I’d like to please.
The pictures are gone. That was sacred intimacy that we shared. There are a whole host of things you and I did together as soulmates that is no one’s
business ever. The things we discussed and trusted with one another is ours and ours only.
I brought it up because you said you would’ve remembered the cam purchase (which we did, and you sent) because you remember big things. This
also was a big thing. It was only to illustrate you don’t remember, but you still swear you do.
Christine, please write whatever you want up. I’m happy to agree. No issues. We started having orgies with the two Filipina girls in Hong Kong when
you were only 18. There is a long list of others and sex clubs since. That is only our business.
I don’t think you get it. I love you. You were my soulmate. I promised till death do us part. If you told me now, how to fix this today, I would. That’s
what a real marriage is. I would never in my worst nightmare want to intentionally hurt you in any way.
I will go to my grave honoring my vow to love, honor, and cherish you, and all we made together and held so dear for three decades. Holding each
other’s hearts and hands in safe protection from the world at large. That was our vow. I’m not going to quit.

It would be much better if you and I were in therapy. We would have a greater chance of success if that was possible, but she says you are not able to

We are not doing the best thing for anyone. We are only doing the best thing you are capable of. I’d like to try and do more, and will do it with a

Message 1637 of 4024
Why are you even bringing it up?? It makes me sick. You use it to humiliate and traumatize me.
Your track record is you do share it with anyone that will listen when you feel wronged or angry.
You brought it up to your entire family when I discovered your affair all those years ago. It was a false narrative to get them to think I somehow
condoned your behaviour or you were confused. Every single one as your excuse. You screamed it to John and Lisa. You have never been a gentleman
about it  and the feedback to me was one of disgust that you would share that. It’s disgusting.
You  brought it up with Elsa.
You have a demonstrated history and pattern. It’s disgusting.
It is humiliating to have that shared and you weaponized it. You weaponized everything that why I stopped doing anything with you that could
remotely be used and weaponized against me.
I will just share that when you do share those details, people think badly of you that you would try humiliate me versus your intended goal of trying to
make you the victim or pity on you. If you think people think I’m the crazy one, just think if you were listening to someone share such intimate details
about their partner at the time. It would be one of betrayal and disgust.
The same will hold true when we step into mediation and your story of not being employed for a year while I bust my ass, manage the kids full time
while you bombard me with crazy and create unsafe condition s that require you to physically leave the state. Documented 100 plus unanswered calls
and texts repeatedly. Everyone in those rooms will be holding down a full time job, while you complain of having a partner leave you after 25 years of
alcoholism and DV. Let’s see how much sympathy that generates.

Updates for the next RO-
Thanks for the constructive feedback. We will adhere to all the "child or property" related constraints as well as the civility and tone standards that
need to be observed. We will do this in a way that addresses your very real concerns about feeling like the mediums below are misused for attacks and
threats. Ideally, this is a baby step in a phased approach to normalcy.
Below is what I think we can agree on. I included "urgent updates" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have
plans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an "emergency". School nurse call or missed
drop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent.
Blessed Updates:
- Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.
- Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for "fyi" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary.
Other Updates:
- We sent Anna Lisa a request to remove a "credible threat for physical violence " last week, which I'm sure you saw.
I think this covers the most critical obstacles to a constructive working protocol. I even think it could accommodate a "running list" format if we
mutually agree it fits the definition proposed. If you do not, I am open to updating if you like, or just not facilitating that discussion for now. But I
think we desperately need it, and just need to be disciplined not to pervert the intent.
I truly hope this is an accurate interpretation of your wishes and accommodates your concerns. If you feel like I am trying to nefariously manipulate
you or the situation, I am all ears. That is not my intent. It would be great to have this in place this week and see what it gets us. If you green light, I
will send to Lisa this AM. You may need to push Anna Lisa. tbh, she is slow. I am hopeful.

By the way, it really hurt my feelings that you said I took everything. That makes me feel really bad. And I had hoped we would discuss it with the kids
before it looked like I was stealing all the Kirkland stuff. You and I had agreed on the list to be sure it was fair.
I think I took the couch and two chairs . I think you kept all the other big furniture in the whole house. I also took the bed at your suggestion, but
gave you the beach bed. Then I took the outdoor furniture that you don’t use at all, no one does. And I got a bunch of junk from the beach but
offered it to you first.
I thought that was consistent with what we had agreed to. I was in no way trying to screw you at all. I thought we did some edits and updates by
swapping things back-and-forth like the bed and the TV in the spirit of cooperation. I thought it was fair.
Then I purchased a pit group from Amazon that was cheap and everything else has been consignment shopping or craigslist. I don’t like the image
that I have just stolen everything against your wishes.
Please let me know how we can resolve that situation if you feel like I’ve done something unfair. But also, please remember that dad‘s house is the boys
house too. We just don’t have a parenting plan in place.
What do you want back?

I’ll forward you the email I’m copy and pasting from below. We did as agreed except you kept the guest bedroom.
You also never had less than three working TVs on the house at all times- Master, Man Cave, AD’s room for three people.
I moved TVs. I also had everything I owned put into trash bags. Tens of them, plus garbage. That was hard on me too.
As mentioned, just tell me what to send back I shouldn’t have taken. I’ll also help you find a cat room couch replacement.
Have a great day!

- TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).
<<OK>>
- You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd like to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in
your sitting room.
- Furniture: I will move our sitting room and guest room stuff to new place.
<<I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may prefer that from a measurement

You being employed is a huge factor Robert. You  are willfully unemployed at this time. That term will be raised at mediation I guarantee. Our burn
is a reflection of when you had a job. Lawyers advice to get a place of equivalent is only relevant if the income in is the same. It is not.
We either ratchet down burn or you get a job. The math is simple.

So after this morning, allow me to state the obvious- one thing we both do is read something, predetermine what it means, no matter what it says,
pervert it, and reply by saying "what you are basically saying is... " when it is almost never the case.
It is easy to do in this flame war format that was made to coordinate drop-off times. But it NEVER helps. Not a single time has it helped ever. So, I
might suggest in the spirit of working constructively working together is we stop that?
The person saying the words know what they are really saying. Telling them that they are "basically" saying something that they did not, but fits our
own narrative, spins us down a counterproductive rabbit hole. It is always pointless.

- When you filed for divorce, we were at 4.0M in "my view" of fidelity.
- After everything done so far, we are at 4.6M in "my view" of fidelity.
So, we have made roughly 1.25M a month since you filed for divorce.
My "panic number" has been 4.2M, but we keep moving the other way.
I manage it pretty closely now, as I have shared, to keep it moving up.

Hey, it was great to hear about how your team's been handling all the recent challenges, especially with everything changing so much. Sounds like
even with Linda shaking things up a bit, you guys are getting the spotlight you’ve worked so hard for. It’s been a long time coming, hasn’t it? I know
this might be a bit of a hard stretch, but looking back, I you’ll see it's all been worth it. You’ve got a knack for making the most out of every situation,
and I’m confident you’re going to shine, and the team will come out the other side even stronger. Even though things are changing between us, I’m
still super proud of you. Christine, you’re something special.

- Sonos: Speakers are pretty scattered but I have several. Do you have any idea how many are still at the house? Some are singles missing their pair. And
the ones from the porch might be missing.
Again, not urgent but slowly working through things that are stacked in the boxes that fill Max’s room. But also want to be sure to get anything

I am trying to be very unemotional but still factual about my disappointment.
The RO is not what we agreed on despite the agreement below. This costs thousands of dollars. It would save us money to just say "no" rather than
say "Agree to RO updates" and then not.
Please advise if you and Annalisa are not planning to go with what we agreed to, and I'll decide how to proceed. After the explicit "what if" detailed
explanations for the changes this is frustrating.
I'll be blunt. This sucks. Last time you said "I'm in control" so I assume you are. Disappointing

She and I went over today and what was sent back reflects our discussion.
The RO continues to include the language for management of shared finances.
The language for physical threats was removed.
For OFW we added the emergency calls option. After further discussion, the other exception would likely be covered under emergency.
First email, added FYI. The other exception basically would open up all email.
You also saw that we sent proposed mediation dates for Summer.

I'll just share. It's tough with OFW with no formatting, but you can probably see it anyway. This also makes me realize this is becoming a self-fulling
prophecy to line the pockets of your lawyer.
I hope at some point (as I think you do) we stop making her rich and let you and I just communicate like adults. I get that it will take time and a
demonstrated history, however.
Thanks!
________________________________________________________________
From OFW:
Below is what I think we can agree on. I included "urgent updates" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have
plans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an "emergency." School nurse call or missed
drop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent. 
________________________________________________________________
- What we agree to: Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.

- Why it's an issue: It does not account for the scenarios outlined above. The proposed RO still limits it to emergencies only.
________________________________________________________________
-What we agree to:  Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for "fyi" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary
- What was sent: The Restrained Person may forward emails from third parties to the Protected Person as an “FYI.” 
- Why it's an issue: Only forwards are allowed. We specifically called out that we could communicate 1-1 on emails with inline as necessary.

The two things we need to have are:
- What we did today with the Sambica camp. We had a forward, a couple questions and that was it. If you think I will abuse it, look at what we did
today. It was not even allowed and I did not abuse it. Please allow that just like we effectively used today.
- A better way to accommodate urgent situations. I had no idea where the tryouts were. I sent you an OFW and said it was urgent. You still did not
check until well after I would have needed to leave. I don’t want to get AD involved in that. We should not. But only the email solved it. Again, not
allowed.
Both are perfect examples of what we need. And we did both today with great success. So we have a proven track record. After a month of this and a
full day tomorrow before you have to rinse and repeat next week, may we please allow what we are already doing? It wasn’t and won’t be abused.
I apologize again for the frustration. It arises from our inability to communicate. If we could just start that again with this baby step, it will go a long
way.
Please just call for five minutes on platform if you would like to discuss. Let’s team up here!

Sorry, trying to understand what you are saying. And I honestly do want to be sympathetic to your asks.
- Is that step away for just tonight?
-  Are we going to discuss tomorrow?
- Should I just ignore the current RO?
- Do stop doing what we already do?
- Should we just keep paying lawyers?
- Today didn’t work, even though it did?
I know you feel pressured. So I will stop. But in this moment, please understand what it is like for me to deal with you. It’s taken weeks. Every
agreement is disregarded. They are honestly worthless now.
And then you complain about my reaction. But please for a moment put yourself in my shoes and think about how you would feel if I did that to you
over and over for weeks and weeks with nothing to show.
I’m not harping on you. But you asked for examples of “how I poke at you”. This is how. We finally communicate like adults, reach an agreement,
and then it all falls apart. It would frustrate anyone.
I’m not going to bitch at you but I’m not sure how you want me to respond when you filed a public RO saying I will beat you and the kids, and won’
t approve what we already do today. After you agreed to it?
- You feel pressured.
- I feel mislead, again.
Now how do we resolve in a constructive way w/o communicating with each other? It’s an endless loop.
Please consider what I am saying, Christine.
Good luck tomorrow I know it will be a tough day. I’ll sell some stock. Best wishes and sweet dreams.

email. I can come here and tell you that, and be nice or a jerk, or do it there and be nice or a jerk. But here we can’t reference anything else in the email
effectively that’s relevant (ex: links, details, schedule graphics) because it’s not here. It just makes it more difficult. That’s all!

That email while I shared I am in back to back was unfair.
I plan to submit a temp proposal to my attorney, which include in phase 1, Adrian has time with you but no over nights to build back trust as he ad
requested, then phase 2 the schedule we had prior to the surveillance.
In regards to reunification, I have no idea what you are communicating to potential candidates, but it seems in reading responses perhaps you have
not been forthcoming about your role and harm. It appears you mentioned 5 different therapists and failed interventions. Are they aware of the exact
reasons or perhaps you are pinning on me as you do in these emails and is my fault.

I explicitly mentioned that you were busy. And I moved the ball forward in everyone’s best interests. I also said I am responsible for a
disproportionate part of the blame. I hope nothing was a dig, not my intent.
Submit what you like. We went to Dr Brown for a reason twice. If both times you refuse to follow her professional guidance after demanding it as a
condition to not press charges, that’s your decision.
With regard to reunification, only a fool would try and portray himself as the hero and you as the villain going into this. I am asked questions I I
answer them. They evaluate based on that. No one will touch us.
I know you’re very busy today, and I don’t plan on fighting with you no matter what. You don’t need that drama while you’re trying to do your job.
Happy to work with you when you have time. Let me know!

I want to be super clear about this offer to help. Just because it's the weekend does not mean that the work goes away. Even if it is paused. And I

So... I noted some offers below. But it stands for the whole weekend till you get caught up. Short of you going on a date, if you just give me a todo list
for the kids, errands or tasks I will work it in and execute w/o discussion.
We were a solid team once, and we can put the drama aside for a weekend and work together. We are still married and should help one another. I'll

We agree. Forgive, don’t forget.
The problem is, your whole focus is on retribution. You want to punish me at great expense to the children’s mental health and our relationship.
I was on a path towards solving the problem as you had asked already. We saw that. It was slow but tracking. You took a different path as iyour
choice.
But perhaps you should ask yourself if you and the kids are better today than on June 30. Was this really the way to do this? Even if we were getting a
divorce.
Perhaps in our discussion with Dr. Brown it would actually be beneficial for us both to understand the role of punishment and creating a successful

We have a few outstanding issues we are discussing but you tend to fire off a response and then go dark for 4-12 hours instead of responding. This gets
frustrating and creates tension as a result because I don’t get to see my kids or solve issues in a timely manner. I don’t think it’s how you would handle
an ask from Julie, but that’s your choice.
But please understand this is an example that I consider to be poking at me, intentionally making our relationship difficult by refusing to move things
forward, that keeps me sitting on my hands or missing time with my children. This is not an unfounded criticism. It’s born out of months of
behavior. It would also frustrate Julie I’m sure.
I tried to be very kind yesterday. I recognized you needed space and help. I tried to do that and my offer still stands today. I don’t harbor any ill will.
But it makes things hard when you are intentionally counterproductive with most every OFW problem solving interaction.
You are smart enough to realize you do this and then tell me you want to see a change. Catch-22, Chinese finger trap, or like they say “the beatings will
continue till morale improves”. It weaponizes what it is supposed to be a safe platform for communication by making it a power play.
If this is the only way you will communicate, perhaps step back and understand the damage it does from a neutral perspective. Or we can ask Dr
Brown. Either way, it goes back to the original issue which is you refuse any professional recommendations to improve our communications.
Just something to consider as it goes from bad to worse. I’ll save yet another “definition of insanity” quote. You clearly either don’t understand what
you were saying for years or are intentionally doing it with malice and forethought. What would you suggest to have constructive communications?
I’m all ears...

That is not my expectation. My expectation is that if we are solving an issue, we either do that or you let me know you are stepping away. Just

-  I assume we kill the basketball idea I had for AD
- I hoped to reach an agreement on Sonos for today
I don’t know either. They both seem to need an answer so I can plan.
The suggestions for Dr Brown improving us can wait but are important.
About the whole job thing, I know you mentioned that a lot, and don’t understand why I don’t do the same thing you do.
I think the easiest explanation is a simple recognition of what is going on. I had my whole life turned upside down on July 5. I found out you were
fooling around with a married man who works for you. I soon had my kids taken, my house taken, and then a restraining orders put on me that say I
beat you and my kids.
So think of it this way. You launched an unexpected attack on a neighboring country-me. You bomb me day and night. I thought we were at peace,
allies. We are not now in a covert move. So you go about your business. Your attack was planned. I alternatively am fighting for my life to understand
what my future is.
It’s a pretty accurate metaphor. Does that help?

When you said “no” I walked away. It was not the outcome I wanted, but you refused and what is more important is that you see I respect your
wishes.
Please note that just because we argue about “if we should ride a roller coaster” it in no way reflects if we will actually enjoy the ride. It’s the same
thing here.
OFW and no attempts at civility got us here. You know that. Please try something new for a change. I’m not asking you to reaffirm your vows.
If we are not nice, or if it goes sideways, we stop that moment. End of story. There is no long term commitment involved. It’s juts trying something
new.
This is a very painless way to see if it allows us to be more civil on other platforms. If we are kind in person, it may help us extend that civility to OFW
too.
- What we’re doing doesn’t work.
- I walked away when you said no.
- I will also, if needed during “our try.”
- It really can’t hurt us just to try
- You can choose what we do to try

complexities of our current situation. The point I would like to make thoughtfully and constructively again is that the "time to heal" path is the one
we have taken since this began. So, reflecting on the results of that path, I am discouraged. I would propose balancing the "time to heal" with an
option that at least changes up the recipe that has only made things worse by engaging in a neutral activity, which could serve as a meaningful step
towards this goal.
I want to remove the tensions that mark our interactions by providing a space where we can be in the same room and enjoy a shared moment someone
else is directing. It is not about forgetting the challenges we face or disagreements that remain; it's about creating a moment that reminds us of the
fundamental respect and connection that sustained us in better times. I hope the new ingredient in our recipe helps us respect our shared history and
our love for our kids so we can establish a more congenial relationship that allows us to make decisions with less emotion and in their best interest.
I understand this is a small step in a much larger journey of healing and reconciliation, and it doesn’t pretend to be a cure-all for the challenges we
face. But given that what we are doing today is not working, I believe it's worth taking if it can lead us towards a more respectful and understanding
relationship, acknowledging our shared history and our love for our family. As mentioned, I'm open to this or any other activity that feels right to
you, and I'm committed to listening to your thoughts and suggestions. I'll wait, but let's find a way to move forward that honors our children and our
individual paths to healing.
I know this scares you. I know you have concerns. But I assure you it is not meant to replace your healing process, which I fully respect and support. It
is to complement it. What we are doing is not working, so I'm grateful for your willingness to consider this on our journey toward becoming effective
co-parents. And we can always just walk away if we don't enjoy it. Let's blow some glass!
Have a great day....

Ok... working through the network stack.
I have found one item I can send back to get a refund from Amazon for $170. I’ll try and do that this week. The other thing busted is our connect. I
will need to replace that but have found a used on Amazon.
Just want to give you a heads up. The choice is to not use probably 8-10k in old stuff we already own, or upgrade everything and get 30% off through
Sonos. So I’m erring on the side of $370 vs $7,000 
Other Sonos stuff I’d like to put into use:
- Sonos sub (was there on moving day)
- Mailbox Sonos speaker
- Side yard Sonos speakers
We could knock this out in about 30 minutes, a ladder, and a hammer, I would guess. BTW - I always kept the key IN the mailbox on purpose. Is that

Thank you!
Correct, I did not list each one of the Sonos speakers or individual component type as separate line items as you note below.
I thought saying the “Sonos stuff” would be inclusive enough to include anything that was branded Sonos. Lesson learned.
I would not mind the extension cords on the outdoor speakers and mounts as well. They are expensive to replace.
I’m going to hold off on the component below for now. It’s expensive so I’m going to try and exhaust all ideas first.
If you spray WD-40 in the key hole it should loosen. It’s in the broom closet, or where the garage cam sat or near.
I’ll try and think if I’m missing anything I need to add details to, but for now please consider power cords as necessary also.

Message 1819 of 4024
Good Morning,
In the quiet moments following this weekend's tensions, I've found myself deeply reflecting on us—not just in the context of our family, but as two
individuals who've shared a life together. This period of separation has prompted me to appreciate the magnitude of what we've achieved over the
years. Despite our differences, perhaps even our incompatibilities, we've built something truly significant, and it shows in our kids. It's a testament to
our efforts, my deep respect for you, and what we've tried to accomplish together.
Perhaps later than you, I realize that we are far more different as human beings than I knew before- on so many levels. I believe neither of us was ready
for what we dove headlong into on "Ashbury beach picture day" with a belief we could will our way through, with best intentions, ignoring our own
baggage from our pasts. Our commitment to making marriage work was remarkable in itself. Whether driven by love, duty, or the sheer desire to
uphold our vows, what we did was real, challenging, and worthy of recognition.
I don't want another long message, instead, I'll simply express my hope for a future where we can sit down together, acknowledging the good times
and the tough, with a focus on moving forward. In a future where we appreciate our efforts without judgment, we understand that we may not have
been fully prepared for the challenges we faced, but we recognize the sincerity of our attempts. I'll be the first to admit that I wish I had the wisdom
you have now, back then, and made an effort to change sooner. Hindsight is 20/20.
I acknowledge your efforts are coming from a place you believe is best. But I hope you will open up to a shared perspective from someone who has
lessons of his own from the past he wants to share from also.
I'm here if you need anything. And I mean that. Have a great day.

I hope you can take a moment and approve this again. If we are intellectually honest with each other, we are doing things to get things done already;
I'm just in danger.
1-1 FYI, emails with inline comments seem like a no-brainer. We have AD basketball camp, SAAS state tournament, and Mark's AMEX that all fit
that bill recently.
Plain 1-1 emails with you where we drop a 3rd party seem incredibly useful but are not allowed either. We really needed that yesterday to act on SAAS
quickly.
Emergency OFW calls are a no-brainer. SAAS was urgent enough for you to reach out to me immediately. I need the same option if you are just not
available.
I hope you see none of these are a threat to your safety. I do not abuse them. They allow for common sense communications to be more effective co-
parents.
Let's please not turn this into a counterproductive scoreboard exercise. If you allow us the means to communicate in a timely and effective way, it will
work wonders.

1) Her thoughts on Parenting Coordinator that she won't put in email
2) The parenting plan we need to submit and how to effectively execute
I think the first is going to be her opinion and pretty straightforward. The second could be dicey, right? The simple answer for her is to say, "Submit
and let the attorneys duke it out." In theory, that's great, but it really translates to "we won't have a temp in place before a formal mediation."
We have flat out agreed 100% to terms of an RO, in writing and we are still arguing about it a whole month later. That is probably a bunny slope
compared to the triple black we are about to point our skis down. She said to "disagree and move forward" but we are not, and we are stuck.
This is not a dig. It's a realistic assessment of where are before we talk to a mental health professional when we have a history that we cannot agree on,
and who we seem to selectively take advice from. IMHO, what we really need is a "temp mediator" and she won't play that role.
I almost think we should have a list of things we know we are going to disagree on and just ask her for help. Otherwise, it's a rinse and repeat where she
will say "This is just my advice as a professional" then we "hear what we want to hear" followed by doing what we want to do.
Then we're stuck with in same situation with our kids paying the price for adult disagreements.

Message 1882 of 4024
I see the call is at 3:15. I will update our Teams meeting accordingly and see you at 3:00.
I also want to continue our working relationship the way we have done the last couple of days and correct what just happened. So I will propose the
following guidelines designed to help us be more respectful so we can have a constructive dialogue that limits triggering each other. And if it happens
anyway, despite this, I am proposing we note that and ask for a resolution of either stopping the conversation or giving the other a chance to correct
or reconcile the triggering action. We need to afford each other the opportunity to course correct a mistake.
Please consider these suggestions.
- Respectful Tone: Speak as if to your boss, respectfully and thoughtfully as if you might get fired.
- No Recap's: Allow each person to express their thoughts without interruption or a "playback."
- No Abrupt Endings: Don't end conversations suddenly after disagreements. Ask for an apology first.
- Listen Actively: Show you're listening without interrupting, using nods or brief acknowledgments.
- Use "I" Statements: Say "I feel..." instead of "you make me..." to express personal feelings without blame.
- Pause Before Responding: Take a moment to think before replying to provide more thoughtful responses.
- Avoid Assumptions: Don't assume intentions or feelings; ask for clarification and limit predetermination.
- Stay on Topic: Focus on the current issue without bringing up unrelated past grievances. Note if it happens.
- Respect Boundaries: If someone needs a break, respect it. Agree on when to continue the conversation.
- Use Neutral Language: Be factual and use non-inflammatory words to keep the discussion productive.
Do you agree? Can we do this in a calm way and ask each other to follow these together?

Max has robotics competition Saturday which I planned to attend in afternoon after Adrian basketball.

If you want to do the weekend march 23/24 take him and Dylan to ski on Sunday, please do. I don’t expect that anytime kids have an event or activity
that falls on your day, I’m penalized for time away so you get my time. I need non school time with them too.
This Wednesday, today, I also see we have meeting with Kari Bates so would not have been able to anyway. So now I’m annoyed you are kicking up a
stink.
Message 1898 of 4024
Our Phase I, as you know had Wed 1/2 days. We did this because I shot hoops with him several times a week and the plan limited it to us to once
every two weeks. That was a huge reduction and you graciously accommodated a smaller reduction. Dr Brown had agreed to update the plan but as
she mentioned, her memory is bad and did not.
You are just ignoring Wed and that is four opportunities a month that I had and you are making no mention of at all and going on about overnights
and skiing. You have had him solo for several months now and ski with him every weekend. Does that count as “non-school” time because I am
confused about what you are saying.
You can get mad at me and start yet another fight, but that’s what you said you would stop. I don’t think either of us remembered Kari Betts as you
might not have scheduled him today for something. I also addressed this in the email I noted you should see below but ignored. So here we are again.
I would prefer to briefly talk about this so we don’t get mad and have crossed wires. Dr Brown said to resume Phase I now. That is not what I see. If
that’s what your choice is let’s call a spade a spade and move on. But all the narrative below on what you do while you have him 100% if the time is
confusing. I just want to follow Dr Brown’s guidance.
Thanks. You can be “annoyed” I asked but it’s frankly not helpful and incendiary to the conversation.

to be more constructive and peaceful. This is about reunification. So, I assume Max and I, only now you and I can never talk or be in the same space
again, which may be fine, too. So, no basketball, robotics, Kerri Betts, SAAS emails or conference calls, no anything - period. Everything has to end,
full stop.
"Dr. Benjamin’s job is to help you improve communication between your child and you."
"If an e-mail is sent to the CoParent Psychotherapist and copied to the other parent, do not answer it before the CoParent Psychotherapist is able to
respond, first."
"Once, the treatment phase begins, for each email reviewed, you will be charged $5. Any email requiring a response from Dr. Benjamin will be charge
at $20 per response.
Based on what is stipulated, NO email can be answered w/o him responding. That's $25 a pop.
Your RO is pointless. This whole time I have been working to at least have some modicum of communication so we could do the things like we did
with Dr Brown, Kerri Betts, Basketball and Robotics, and most importantly getting Adrian into SAAS. That all goes away. We do nothing now.
We went from plans of nesting and the Alyssa model to this. Do you really believe this was all my fault? It all rests on me. Even as you said, you are in
total control, doing what you think is best. I tried so hard to extend an olive branch, and you are never ready. You won't make any effort whatsoever,
so now we have to be treated like toddlers and charged $25 an email.
You promised to consider my proposal to just stop and find something neutral to do to build something back. Today you said you would not
consider that any longer. You said today you would make time to discuss before the end of the week. It will be the last time we talk and I have no
reason to believe you will make good on that promise either.
- Yes, it is all your way. It is what you think is best?
- This is really how you wanted this to go for us?
- This is what you think the kids want to see from us?
We will hate each other's fucking guts till the wet sod is laid over our cold dead bodies. Such a waste of 3 decades and 3 kids. I ask you every few days
since you say it is your way or the highway... How is your way going? Still feeling pretty good about your master plan?

The Alyssa model was aspirational. It was clear that was never going to work once your behaviour started to spiral out of control making the family
feel unsafe.
That model I now see would not work if there is DV or history of substance abuse or emotional disregulation.

I have been trying to finalize the language before I send the parenting plan and we heap cash on the fire for every grammatical tweak we need to go
back in forth in 1k exchanges.
If you can call me urgently for me to get Adrian back into SAAS, and we swap multiple emails, and have multiple teams calls. We could do something
as simple as this too.
You are picking and choosing when to talk. I am documenting the SAAS Hail Mary and our amazing teamwork vs. your refusal to wordsmith in an
attempt to work collaboratively.
You are intentionally, with forethought and malice, forcing an undue legal process and incurring wasteful and unnecessary burden to this process
with no regard to cost at this point.
If you would like to put the same effort into me reviving the SAAS opportunity for this, please let me know. I am all ears and willing to work with
you.

I’m clearly asking to employee the SAAS model. That requires nothing more than what you did when SAAS went up in flames. This is no different.
If you want to make the case it is, and you are forced to burn our community property, that is your choice. We will leave it up to a mediator to sort
through the differences in the SAAS vs Parenting Plan styles.
I am only documenting my interest in saving the money by working together again and your decision. Please let me know. I’d love to work with you.

Thanks for making the time.
Yesterday I asked for an opportunity for us to have a meeting of the minds and really talk about how we can stop this daily slide into hate and
destruction. But now we have urgent issues as well—Andy, RO, and the Parenting Plan.
So are we going to work on what happens in the Emergency Room, or are we going to discuss if we need to start wearing a seat belt? I'd prefer that we
put on the seat belt, but we have patients bleeding out in the emergency room.
I hope you will thoughtfully consider the ongoing impact of saying you are "just not ready" to put on the seatbelt. We have created a prison of our
own making and are paying the price. Hint: adding more locks and layers won't help.

Hey-
Here is a cleaned-up version of exactly what we discussed. I will instruct Lisa to add this almost verbatim to the Parenting Plan. She needs to make
more general than "the restrained person."
Then we can 1) send the parenting plan to you to agree on and 2) send suggestions to Annalisa for the updated RO, Then I will sign.
Do you want to send the note to Annalisa for the RO updates noted below? I think she may bristle if it comes from Lisa tbh.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Other restraining orders:
The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted, below:
The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to discuss
the management of shared assets.
The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in communications with third parties to facilitate business
concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.
The Restrained Person may forward emails from third parties to the Protected Person as “FYI.”  and allow for 1-1 updates and inline responses to
provide context or advance a private 1-1 discussion on the matter. Example: school admission
The Restrained Person may use phone calls via the OFW platform for short-notice, urgent communications, such as notifying for late handoffs or
emergencies. Example: Missed bus, school nurse, medical or educational crisis (SAAS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This week, we have:
- Gotten AD into SAAS after denial.
- Had a breakthrough with Dr Brown
- Kicked off Kids therapy with Kerris Betts
- Finalized the RO we both are happy with
- Agree to the terms of the Parenting Plan
- Have a co-paring dialog started with Andy

If you don’t understand that, lineup his rules for communication side-by-side with what we established today. Do me a favor and tell me if they look

It’s simply much more effective to have a five minute conversation than a OFW thread an email thread and us bickering back-and-forth. We proved

Good morning! I think we have a few topics. Glad it does not have to be separate emails!
- AD and Dad: I chatted with him earlier this AM. He is playing the new fortnight now so we agreed I would grab him around lunch.
- SAAS: We are good to go. I'll keep you in the loop with any updates I get. I have talked to AD. We will get his charger back on Monday.
- RO: Annalisa keeps sending the version that has "physical violence." Should we update and send it to her instead to stop the confusion?
- Parenting Plan: If I can get this to you and Annalisa today, can you guys formally approve it today so we can knock that out?
- Sonos: I think they should all be down and ready for handoff now. What is going to work best for you so I can keep that moving?
- Andy: As mentioned, I'm all in as you confirmed we would follow the Plan and RO. If you let him know that, we can start today.
Yikes! Six important topics in one exchange. I am extra appreciative of your cooperation and flexibility this week as this is still so hard. But we have are

We had
- 3 email exchanges
- 18 OFW exchanges
His Cost
- $ 5 - send one topic email
- $20 - per mandatory reply
Response Rules
- 24 hours for the questions

- 48 hours with a reminder
Conversation Summary
- The cost of having this conversation for 21 exchanges, at $25 per exchange = $525.
- The elapsed time to have this conversation, at 48 hours max per exchange = 42 days.
- This conversation would end on April 19, 2024 if it was done. We are not done yet.
Love to hear your thoughts when you have time so we can keep this moving. I hope we finish strong after the 6 issues in 4 days we were able to nail
with our improved communication!
The proof is in the pudding.

You rock! Thanks for the quick turnaround. You have gotten so much better at this and I can’t tell you what a difference it makes in issue resolution.
No wonder we got so much accomplished this week. 
- RO & PP: does that mean we update your RO to get it right and send it to Annalisa? Just want to confirm so i don’t ruffle “turf feathers” Can you
review after meetings? I know you are busy but I’d love to close after all these months.
- Andy: if we do send back and you and Annalisa will approve the RO as mentioned, we can make progress. Agree we’re dead in the water with the
wrong one filed. Do you want to let him know we are a go after that and plan to follow our RO and PP ?
- Sonos: Thanks for helping to stop this from dragging on. I assume you found my Sub? Even if you bring the other stuff and take a pic of the back

Message 1969 of 4024
So that is six hours off my day. And you are acting as the go-between for altering times with Adrain when you knew we had confirmed plans already.
They could also very well be in the boy cave I spent weeks and $$$ building for them, exactly for the sole purpose of "Movie Marathons" over here.
What would you propose as the best way for us to handle these situations together now that they have been created and will be very tough to unwind?
It's my time, and I have the perfect place. If you want them to have a good relationship with their father, I would hope you advocate for that instead
of this.
I don't care about the Parenting Plan violation, but I do want to get this right. I just resent the note about reunifying Max earlier. We talked about it
yesterday.
Are you going to foster and help enable a healthy and positive relationship between our children and me, or do you feel like this is a better course of
action?

See below. Adrian and I chatted. We talked about the entire day. I even gave you details of what he was doing now so you had to know we chatted.
We did have a time- it was noon. For you to say “I thought you talked with him” is frustrating, because I did. And then I told you I did. And then I
told you the results of that discussion. Please see below.
Options:
Adrian lied to you and said we did not chat
You decided I lied below and did not chat
I told you I would coordinate with him. I did coordinate with him. And then you decided I did not and stepped into the middle of it.

What do you want him to help with? It's all in black and white already. How can I help you?
At this point, this conversation by his rules, would mean:
- $150 to read and reply
- 240 hours or ten days
I don't see the confusion, tbh. You said I did not coordinate. I did. I sent you the coordination.
You can keep saying you don't grok that, but do we need someone else to recap and just say:
"He told you he would coordinate"
"He confirmed that he coordinated"
"You said he did not coordinate"
"He showed you he did coordinate"
"You said you needed help to understand"
And you are at home? You said you were going in. This could have been so simple.
This was my day. It was confirmed until you stepped in. I'm starting to get frustrated.
You own next steps with Andy. Again, I have 8 emails that document our agreement.

I will check with Lisa. But, as mentioned on several occasions now, you and Annalisa need to file the correct RO. I have said this many times before.
Checking prior to that does not help.
You own Andy. You are telling him that we will follow our RO and PP just as you said, and I quoted you on several times in the 21 emails that I
documented below that is now up to 30.
Why didn't you check with me instead of saying, "I thought you would coordinate," and then step in? I did coordinate. It was my day. I showed you I
coordinated the conversation with Adrian after you came home. You knew I had done that. If you did not understand, you should ask me instead of
saying I didn't do it when I sent you a report of me doing it.
I get the feeling that you are perhaps too busy to have a meaningful conversation. You honestly don't seem to be able to remember or understand
something that is written right below what you are replying to. I don't say this as an insult. I say it out of concern for you. I am sincerely worried at
this stage and wonder what is going on. Are you noting this in your work at all?
I honestly am not trying to bash you. We have been together for three decades. If we need to pump the brakes and figure out what is going on I am
fully supportive. Everyone needs you to be mentally healthy, resilient, and in a sound state of mind. If you want to have a very peaceful, non-
controversial conversation, I and happy to discuss. I really want to help. I mean that.

The way I read your RO, it does not specify a protocol for emergencies. Communication between parties is limited to the Our Family Wizard solely
for the purpose of co-parenting. No specific emergency communication protocol is mentioned. That is why I had it added to my version.

I could either:

- Go by the house anyway to grab shoes
- Let him call to allow us to grab his shoes
Note that
- you said you would get him packed but didn’t
- missed the game time too today, not here
- don’t reply to urgent OFW parenting ask

I am willing to work with you so hope you see that in that spirit.
You also had kids spending spring break with you this year.
I haven’t paid much attention to the financial side but now that we are close to finalizing PP, it is a natural progression of next steps.
We probably have a different opinion of what future spousal support looks like. Child payments are just a formula.
I haven’t taken time to pull together documents for asset split or spousal but am just starting to think about it.

I realize now in our 1:1 setting, I feel anxious and get pushed to agreeing to things. I ask not to do them and communicate that. I try to wrap the
conversation or discussion as quickly as possible. Once in calmer environment, without your influence, I am able to think clearly.
If there are situations that require limitations, as in our case, it is not 50/50. That is why we are negotiating this PP.
Bringing up Kevin is disappointing. I have avoided responding and addressing when you have brought up on numerous occasions in the past, but will
address for one last time.
Reference to Kevin is harassment and disturbance of the peace in violation of the RO. RO states communications are limited to co parenting or
shared assets.
Given the space of 8 months to reflect on what happened, I disagree with the characterization of an affair. That is not a fact. You made me agree to
something after months of yelling and your view of what happened. I did not disclose the picture to you when asked, but that does mean it was an
affair. I would characterize it as a friendly interaction.
I don’t consider that issue as something that relates to our co parenting or shared assets. And will not engage in that discussion any further. If you
choose to do so, you know my perspective on that topic and intersection with RO.

My perspective (I am not a professional)  is he is scared of showing you in person, but has now been allowed to process the trauma and past and
validate how he felt in that moment.
Similar to when Adrian texted you about why you did all those things from those vacations, he needs to understand it too.
That’s why reunification therapy is so important in my mind.

So I think the first rule of a healthy negotiation is not laying down “my way or the highway”!ultimatums. I don’t see any issues with what you are
asking and are similar to what I would propose.
But when you start the discussion in such a counterproductive way asserting your omnipotence, it’s a bad tact. Do you want to think about treating
me as an equal and not someone who works for you?

An RO was filed based on your conduct. This required limitations to time with kids.
You have now said if I truly believe it file charges.
A condition of the RO and not DV protection order was you admitting the behaviour.

You said very clearly below you are doing that. The two can’t happen concurrently. And, I told you very clearly that I would send you a parenting
plan that mirrors, Dr. Brown. If it does not, I am open to changing it. If that was somehow incorrect in its interpretation, I am more than happy to

Let's both just be measured, constructive and cooperative. I put the note below in the invite so I hope you agree.
One thing I will note that I am not sure resonates with you is that every single mental health professional we have ever seen, and Dr. Brown was the
most forceful and direct, said the attorneys are not trying to help us. They stir the pot and make money even if it destroys our children's lives. You
keep saying you want professional guidance but insist on doing the opposite with the most critical piece—the attorneys who keep making things
worse. Please consider taking the advice of professional child advocates and stop doing that. They are our children.
__________________________________________________________
If you share ahead of time, as I offered to do with you on every occasion, I can see changes, and we walk through them more effectively. I'll have her
guidance to compare it with prior to the call. I assume we both track changes, so we are transparent and just do it.
We should aim to be as close to Dr Brown's guidance as possible and both be prepared, as she likes to say, to be "equally unhappy. " And if we don't
agree, it would be much more cost-effective and beneficial to our mental health to ask to schedule time with her.
Which was why I called the last meeting. Because I did not want us to have TWO versions of her and  then pay tons of money to have our lawyers
fight it out. It was specifically to avoid us having an impasse before we even got started. Let's please consider that.

Message 2083 of 4024
I will discuss changes with but not language as I may tweak it.
We opted not to go with a full Parent Evaluation. Dr Brown did not speak to Adrian about the history and you insisted it be limited to that one event.
She has never had the full story. A full parent evaluation is still in my mind an option, if I don’t believe full accountability and recognition of your
actions and impact are considered and reflected in how we structure the plan.
I am growing increasingly concerned by your accusatory tone, bringing up delays as my fault, and a minimization of impact of your 25 history on the
family. In one breathe you will say it, then point to a recent 4 month window out of 25 years that things may have been stable and you you showed up
in a way a father is normally expected to. In that window, what you fail to mention is regression to unsafe behavior, emotional dis regulation, relapse
from sobriety, and recent unlawful surveillance activity. It is with that lens I structure the plan for best interest of children in mind.
This is aside from continued insistence that you and I develop a friendly relationship, that I have been advised by mental health professionals, is not
appropriate at this time given the history of DV and coercion and control. That request must stop.
It is in my right to change my mind after i experience various factors, which includes continuation of behaviour that I feel are unsafe
You may feel anger at this. I can’t control that. What you are not in your right to do is lash out at me. An RO was filed to protect me from that
behavior.

Ok...
Please don’t take this the wrong way. But my strong suspicion is that Annalisa just never filed the paperwork.  I say that because I saw the email to
Annalisa asking her to do that from my attorney and she seems slow sometimes. I could be wrong, however. We will see. But I think it’s an easy fix.
I also let Lisa know that you planned to press charges today based on last night. But it’s still my hope we can go the Dr Brown route despite the fact
that it appears she has given up on us. Please fill her in on the details she needs if you think that helps.
Note that with the parenting evaluation, we will need to 1) cancel our July mediation. No way to get that done before mid July. 2) start the six figure
trail prep. That July date was the last possible time we could do without beginning the trial preparations.
I’d still very much like to work with you in the kids best interest and am willing to let Dr Brown author the plan  given her expertise. But you will need
to let me know how you want to proceed. My assumption unfortunately is Lisa will advise zero contact soon.
Hope you have a good day and can compartmentalize this a bit. It’s a work day and you have my promise not to start or contribute to any distracting
drama on here. I want to enable the most peaceful and constructive atmosphere for you that I can.

As mentioned, I’m not sure, but I am 90% sure Lisa sent our copy signed to Annalisa when she asked her to sign for your side and file with the court.
However, my assumption may be wrong. But based on prior history, that typically is the case. I think we can agree there.
I am not requesting you file charges. I can’t make that clearer. I have never claimed "a RO" was frivolous. We suggested an RO that prevented digital
surveillance. You came back with an RO that cut off all constructive communication methods and channels. That may have been over the top.
You focused instead on allowing no emails, phone calls, or texts even for emergencies. It was for child-related issues only; with no allowance initially
for anything else. You also added I was a "credible threat" to physically beat you guys out of the blue. That is not at all about monitoring.
So there should be no contention in mediation. You raised monitoring as an issue. We tried to solve the issue you raised. You chose to add things to it,
using the RO as a vehicle for other issues. I think we both can see and agree that I don't beat my kids now or ever, but it was filed.
I expect you to go over the PP with Annalisa and know things will get MUCH WORSE. It happens every time. So, we are at the impasse we tried to
avoid. The only remedy is using Dr Brown, who we chose for that reason. Otherwise, we could have been at this same impasse in October.
If you want to discuss I am open to it. But I have said "what I am saying" so please don't tell me I'm saying something else. If you feel anything I am
saying is incorrect or inflammatory, it is not my intent. I hope it is pretty uncontroversial. I will chat if you like to bring the temp down on this
I really, sincerely, honestly hope with all my heart NOT to step on a landmine with one of my words. I honestly wish I was bringing you poke with
fresh avocados, lemon, and fruit for lunch to openly and honestly talk about what needs to happen next. I wish we had done that then.

A three-week delay on simple paperwork is not trivial. At the rates we pay them, I expect better in the interest of our children. It also concerns me that
other things may be "lurking" that we may not even be aware of. Things that may be of more severe consequence than this. Who knows.

Do you have any thoughts now that the $$$ snowball is rolling downhill and will only get bigger? This will probably be our biggest day ever, which I

Apple Family Sharing fully respects members privacy:
1. **Shared Purchases**: Family members can access each other’s purchased apps, music, books, and more, without being able to see who bought what
or when it was bought.
2. **Shared Subscriptions and Storage**: Family members can use shared subscriptions like Apple Music Family Plan or a shared iCloud storage plan
without access to each other's personal data or files.
3. **Ask to Buy**: For children’s accounts, purchase requests are sent to the organizer, but this does not allow the organizer to see the child's existing
purchase history.
4. **Personal Data**: Each family member's photos, documents, and personal information remain private, and other family members can never access
them unless shared or sent intentionally.
5. **Emails and Messages**: Family members cannot access each other’s emails, messages, or call history ever.
Family Sharing is designed to share benefits while protecting individual privacy, and no personal content is shared by default without explicit user
action.

I have now fully dug into the implications and potential outcomes for different paths, and am realizing what has transpired and the control and
coercion you have tried to assert on me through this process, for a certain path. The genuine fear I operate on to soothe things or not get you upset or
angry. The need for the RO as recent as January, is a demonstration of that dynamic, and yet you act as if that was not serious or your actions did not
really warrant one based on your continued assertions that your story is correct.
Your reference to $$$ spent is another scare tactic to acquiesce to your desire to structure everything to maximize your outcome, which does not
provide the real protection to me and boys or provide the true and acknowledge what transpired in the marriage and family dynamic. If the truth is

Kids, I acknowledge your assertion. I plan on following a Parenting Plan. We are supposed to have a temporary one in place immediately following
your divorce filing. Today, after working with child-focused professionals, I have shared five with you in six months.
Cabo Time Share- wrt community property, this turn is mine. You canceled my October trip when we agreed to make plans for Elsa's wedding. It was
my turn then, so we don't just skip me. You also went to Hong Kong and Universal Studios as a secret surprise to me.

What i have been trying to do since the divorce filing was reach agreement with you in a way that minimized involvement of 3rd parties, but structure
an agreement that demonstrated the seriousness of what transpired and what needs to happen to move forward to provide safety for all.
After your outburst on Sunday, and continuing demand I file charges, and lack of true accountability, I stepped back and reevaluated the totality of
what transpired in the relationship and your continuing behavior to me. While I have been focused on substance abuse and protecting against that, as
that is what I recognized and was familiar with, the domestic violence aspect experienced by kids and I was truly never acknowledged. I have done
extensive reading on this subject now and how PP should be structured.
I now realize that my approach was wrong, and my initial efforts were actually short sighted, as it did not set up a plan for long term healing and
potential positive outcomes.
I will have my lawyer reach out to yours to provide our thoughts on next steps.

Should we chat?
It feels like we’ve veered so far off track that finding our way back seems almost impossible. Our love once blazed as brightly as the stars, but that same
energy now powers a relentless cycle of hate and disdain.
Every week, I suggest trying something new, anything to help us see the good in each other again and build a life our boys would be proud to emulate.
I’ve been pushing for us to keep things civil, and you say you are tired of the endless fighting. Yet, somehow, things keep spiraling every day, with each
of us only seeing perspectives from our POV.
We both know this isn’t working, and no therapist would disagree. What do you say we take a moment, step back from the chaos on the dancefloor,
and look at where we are from the balcony?
Maybe it’s time to consider healthier paths, anything different from the mess we are in now. Every week, we agree this does not work. Every week we
still find common ground. Then every week we abandon that and fight even harder. I'd like to discuss this with a cooler head if you would.
Thanks!

So under your “self proclaimed, child centered” approach your plan pencils out to less than 24 hours a year. Curious to see  if the mediator or judge

Interrogative statements are noted with the symbol "?" at the end of the sentence. If you look at that symbol and work backward, you will see that I
did not ask for anything about Max. I actually asked, "So, I do nothing now?" Mind letting me know on the 4th try now?
Also, per the thoughts on Max noted below, are we following the Dr Brown plan as you propose to assert here? The last I saw was that you were
rejecting that and were coming up with a plan based on your internet browsing instead of Dr Brown's professional advice.
Letting me know what you are doing might be helpful for the children's sake.
Regarding your plan, I'd also like to know when I will actually see Adrian again.
Please advise on since you brought up the topic. Looking to co-parent with you.
Thanks!

btw- I’d still like to know the answers to my questions, but I don’t need to be snarky. I’m just so frustrated that we were doing so amazing just a week
back. And just like that, we are worse than we have ever been with no peaceful plan towards reconciliation or cooperative co-parenting. How do we
always get worse and never build on our wins?

Good Morning-
I can't seem to get an answer from you on almost anything we are trying to do together, so I pulled some of the most pressing concerns into one of our
familiar "running list" formats that works well for us. Please see below. I do need some things answered today. Have a great day!
Robotics Breakfast- I signed up for this and would like to coordinate in existing 3rd party emails but I can't reply. I have asked you 4 times now if we

can coordinate our commitment. What is the plan for tomorrow?   
AD visit Time- You have clawed back almost all the Dr. Brown recommended approved visits. She noted that Adrian wanted to see me even a month
ago. When do I get to see him again as she said he needed? 
Restraining Order- The version that frivolously states I am a "credible threat to do physical harm" has been filed for months. What is your plan to
remedy the false public portrayal of my character? 
Parenting Plan- Our journey includes five therapists and six parenting plans, beginning with the one I wrote and shared on Sept 22. No, predictability
is destructive to our kid's mental health. What are your next steps?
Spring Break- We had a plan that Dr Brown sanctioned for me to have this one. You ignored it along with the parenting plan. I proposed a healthy,
child-focused compromise. What is your response?
Dr. Brown- You said she was not able to offer an appropriate parenting plan because she was uninformed after 10 meetings. We both offered you the
opportunity to educate her. Do you plan to do that?
Returning Sonos- We communicate weekly on this, and you assure me you will get these to me. You sent me trash instead of the Sonos in January.
What are your plans to get these to me as promised?
3rd Party emails- You are blocking me from co-parenting with 3rd parties via the RO to co-parent unless you need me to reverse Adrian's SAAS
rejection, which I miraculously did. Can I participate on these?
Xfinity- Every day, I send you screen captures of the alerts you send me via Xfinity. These were the basis for your surveillance claims. You won't stop
creating the situation months later. Is this on purpose?
Drop-In- You're aware you still have drop-in audio and video capabilities to surveil me. I send you screen captures of your recent call attempts that
you deny doing. I've asked that we stop this. How do we stop?
Andy Benjamin- We agreed in writing that we would see him as our divorce counselor at Dr. Brown's recommendation. Your RO prevents us from
doing that. Are you backing out of that commitment?
OFW expectations- You have this list of questions because you read my co-parenting requests to coordinate child-centered or property-focused
topics, but don't reply. Is there a plan to replace OFW? 
Please consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a
false RO you mistakenly filed. The impact is that we are not able to co-parent in a child-centered way or resolve ongoing property situations in a
timely or amicable way.
I want to work with you to determine how we do this in the best interest of all involved and in a cost-effective way that does not require an attorney
to send an attorney the same question I already sent you. That seems frivolous, expensive, and unnecessary, so I hope we can reach a more amicable
and less expensive solution.
Please advise, and have a great day!

Robotics Breakfast-   I was planning to buy bagels, cream cheese, yogurt and silverware tonight. Given Max’s feedback regarding in person viewing
which I shared, I did not plan to attend the competition this weekend.
AD visit Time-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Restraining Order-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Parenting Plan-  I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Spring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Dr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like.
Returning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous
nature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely.
3rd Party emails- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Xfinity-  Please provide evidence I will not stop creating the situation months later. Xfinity told me this is an impossible scenario. Please stop
monitoring our internet.
Drop-In-  PLEASE UNPLUG THE DEVICES. I have communicated to you on numerous occasions I do not know what is happening and have not
made any attempt to drop in on you.
Andy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.
Even under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO?
OFW expectations- OFW will be the platform.
Please consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a

Spring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
<<We disagree. I will find mails on OFW discussing this. We can also speak with Dr Brown about our discussion. Either way there are no current
plans for Spring Break, so I hope we find a peaceful child focused compromise as discussed>>
Dr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like. <<We
have. It is in the last email. Do you need me to forward so you can see the next steps that she suggested? I also know you said after reading the internet
you would be crafting a new parenting plan instead of Dr. Brown's. Is that your position still?>>
Returning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous
nature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely. <<you are talking about 1/3 of the Sonos. I have asked to take a picture

calls are still showing there. I have shown you this. You are aware that you still send drop-in requests to audio and video monitoring devices that you
sent me to use. I show you this. Let's just peacefully resolve as I suggested>>
Andy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.
Even under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO? <<I told you that it does not align. You
know that well and good. How can we communicate email only if by law you don't let me do that. This is not a mystery. The RO needs to afford for
us to communicate. You don't allow that.>>
OFW expectations- OFW will be the platform. <<Why aren't we going with the arrangements that you have signed off on twice as we have talked
through them at great length? We are back here chasing our tails. We need the email options we discussed with 3rd parties, to strategize about 3rd
parties, communicate with SAAS, Basketball, Robotics, etc... , and we need it to use Andy. If you are intentionally keeping me from effective
parenting, similar to the SAAS situation, I hope you will reconsider. Please work for a more effective and reasonable solution so we can serve the
children's best interests>>

This isn’t really fair to me as a coparent. I’m trying to get some information because all this starts early in the morning and you are not going to get
back to me in time. You are intentionally not allowing me to coparent at all at this stage. Nothing... even on the event that i set up. I am the one who
signed up for it.
And you are an acting as the sole go between Max and I. It’s not combative or controversial questions. And i set it up, but you have blocked me from
being involved now. Allowing me to understand how I can participate in a constructive capacity is not too much to ask given you built this barrier.
And given the timing and disregard for our agreement for communication it is urgent to get clarity. My relationship with my son. And my
commitment to the school that I had to work miracles on to get Adrian into after your way got him rejected are super important to me. It was to you
too, when you asked me to fix it. This is unfair Christine.

Drop in. I am not dropping in on you.  
<<Thank you for the reassurance but I don't feel great tbh. I see the attempts, screen capture them, share that instant, and ask about them. Just as I do
the constant daily Xfinity alerts that your ISP sends me. As explained before, the devices you used to drop in on me were in active use, going back to
our Beach days as a family. They were the two cam/audio Alexa devices that we used when we could not find our phones. The Kirkland home
initiated these calls from either the Kitchen or your office. Everyone in our family knows this and has used it. This will never be up for debate and the
kids can both explain it. 
If you have devices that allow me to drop in, then change permission settings. 
<<I only have these devices because you shipped them to me for my use inside my home instead of in the Kirkland home. I plugged them in and was
simply ignorant you sent me audio/video equipment that would allow you that capability. It honestly felt innocent at the time. I can't change your
permission settings any more than I can change permissions on Xfinity. They are yours. You control them. If it confuses you to understand why
Amazon would not let anybody take over your audio/video drop-in devices just because they physically have them and then allow this, think about
what that means in nefarious situations.>> 
I don’t have access and control to whatever settings you say I have.
<<Thank you for the reassurance. I will look again to verify if that is true. I sent you screen captures that say otherwise as recently as last weekend. But
perhaps you will relinquished that capability this week. That would make me feel better. Note I believe I have unplugged everything you sent me and
only see alerts on my phone. I hope that effectively stops the drop-ins from connecting but not the initiation of the attempt. You own those.  You

<<Thank you for the kind offer. Unfortunately, your phone has zero to do with this. An examination of your phone records would yield as much
useful information as a review of our tax filings. As I have noted, you have devices that are registered to you with indoor audio/video drop-in
capabilities that work just the same if phones were never invented. If you would like a third party to explain that, please feel free. An expert can also
explain the tech behind the Blink cam incident. That is a simple, demonstrably reproducible scenario you can see live today, but you can refuse to see
that demonstrated yourself.>>
If I am as you allege, then I will pay for that review. If I am not, then you pay for it. 
<<I have not alleged anything more than the fact that it is happening. I shared both when it happens and who the devices are registered to- You. I have
no way of knowing if it is you, the kids, or a visitor to the house. Only you are registered as the device owner on the initiating end (your iPhone, office
Alexa, others?) and that they call the receiving end (K-town Kitchen, Beach Office, Beach Deck, my Phone). In my heart, I don't believe you "spy" on
me any more than I spy on you. What good is that to either of us? It's just dumb and really provides no "strategic advantage" to anything we are trying
to accomplish as co-parents.>>
Quick Recap:
- On 10.21, after getting you a phone, I sent you an email (see attached) that said: "Christ... we are so intertwined. We will be sorting this out for
years.... 
    
- You started saying I bugged your phone because of how quickly I replied to you on OFW. This was actually my watch vibrating when you sent me
something.
- You started saying I was tracking your car because somehow I was catching you lying. You misrepresent the truth so often (Boxing Day), your "tells"
are obvious. 
- You maintained the ability to track my car and where I was coming and going in real time. You have assured me you deleted the app and don't use it
anymore. 
- Then we had the cam incident that gave you another reason to say I was spying on you. I apologize for not being more forthcoming and explaining
this in detail. 
- You were super pissed I asked for a mutual "no digital surveillance" agreement. Your response was you would initiate career-ending litigation if I
asked for this. 
- You changed the Kirkland Xfinity plan to eliminate my access. As the network admin, you send me daily alerts and below you somehow say "stop
tracking me".
- I began noting the situation mentioned above to you along with screen captures. I explained the tech and told you how we can stop it but you have
made no effort.
- You said I was tracking you since we have a Microsoft family plan. The data on the shared plan has never changed, and you know this because you
paid that bill.
- After hearing about the cam situation in painstaking detail and a series of meetings, Dr. Brown said we both have good points; it's time to move
ahead w/o retribution. 
At present, in addition to the things mentioned above, you can still control the sleep number of my bed and I can control the temperature of the
Kirkland house (which you ask me to help with.) After telling you we have a bunch of things that a smart, digitally connected, and cost-conscious
family would implement to keep the kids safe, discourage intruders, and save money, here we are. My apology for not "re-notifying" you of offline
cams used for visual deterrence resulted in not being able to see my kids and likely irreparable parental alienation. My request for you to share "mutual
digital monitoring protocols" resulted in threats against my livelihood, promised legal retribution, and a false restraining order that says I am a
"credible threat to do you and my kids physical harm" stands to this day. Despite confirming that the RO was both a mistake to file and false, you
refuse to remedy the situation.  
You always criticize me when I spend the time and effort to explain things to you in detail and recount our history. You say it is too much for you to
understand and it makes you mad that you have to spend time reading it and have to come back later. So yes, it did take 30 minutes to write this all
down. But I think it is important to separate fact from fiction, and given the toll it has taken, if you have made it this far,  it might also be worth you
taking ten minutes to read and contemplate we really don't have to keep going down this road. I genuinely want what's best for our kids, and
honestly, I want what's best for you – for the sake of our safety and peace of mind. If you're open to looking at things differently, I'm more than ready
to work together in a positive way.

I apologize for the start of the conversation. I acknowledge I began expressing my sincere concerns. I've been your soulmate for 28 of our 29 years
together, which is a hard habit to break when I see you this way.
I did want to connect to discuss the Robotics situation for reasons I mentioned below and did not want to eat up our limited OFW minutes. I agree.
That clearly triggered you, and you hung up and refused to reengage.
I also agree that you told me "your plans for the activity I signed up for". Reminiscent of signing up to be our kids' father and telling me your plans to
accommodate that role in their lives. I don't get a say in anything.
When you started this, our kids were great with me. I have evidence and history of that, and you have admitted as such. You cherry-pick advice you
want to leverage like it's canon law and ignore anything else.
You know no reunification therapist will touch us because there is no accountability for you, and you still don't let me see the kids 8 months into this.
You also caused months to pass before even Kerri Betts could engage.
So, while you have chosen to supplant me as the Robotics volunteer and father figure, I had additional questions I wanted to ask so I could play some
small part in their lives. But you would not permit that conversation.
I knew this was going to be the case because you are as predictable as the tides, so I called several times to find a way to be in Max's life. You did not
respond till well after the event (over 21 hours) eliminating that.
You found and implemented your own justification for parental alienation as you do daily.

Sending you a device that you sent to me that is not plugged in does not stop this. You have to understand I know you are not in my house, plugging
them in and calling me from a secret location. I can explain what’s happening again if you still don’t understand this. It’s really easy. I don’t mind.
There is no need to fight. Document what you like.
- You and or your legal counsel did file the wrong RO on me: documented
- You acknowledge you didn’t approve the physical abuse claim- documented.
Let’s please stop fighting! Let’s please work together. I have never come after you for ANYTHING! If I have, please let me know how to rectify. I

A simple, brief, clarifying phone call where tempers are measured long enough to separate the signal from the noise works wonders! We can stop the
madness of OFW if we so choose.
We just need a calm moment now and then to be sure each other understands what the other is really saying rather than assuming we know what they
are saying. It really does work, Christine.
Please consider affording us that on occasion. I’d even say when we see something we might consider to be inflammatory, maybe we stop OFW before
it gets worse and have a clarifying chat.
We really can take this back and work together.

Is $500 a month the right number for a 3.5k square ft house with 4 bathrooms and 5 bedrooms?
It’s 1k a month for a 3.0k square ft house when I only clean 1 bedroom 1 bath and 1/2 bath.
I mean it’s orders of magnitude off. Like 3x what I am asked for. I just don’t understand how.

No... because I have only done it once since I moved in because it is always so expensive. So I’ve spent $500 when i really needed it after all the

Hey-
I’m not getting a courtesy response anymore so I realize there is no way I’m getting these back in real life. It’s been a couple months, probably 30
emails, and many promises of “today” “this week”, etc...that you were going to give them to me.
So it’s clear you won’t take a moment from your social life to let me get them under your supervision outside the house. That’s fine, but I’m done
playing Charlie Brown to your Lucy. So to help our relationship out I’m going to just buy brand new.
One is the sub, that’s about $800. And the other three are play 5 speakers (the only ones I bought) which run around $800 each. I’ll attach the cart
and price info. So when we start splitting things you keep those, and I’ll keep these. It’s $3.3k and we are even.
Just documenting because the replacement cost on these ten year old speakers is a fortune. But that’s the only way to do this unless I can find another
angry but reasonable ex-wife who wont give them back but is willing to sell for the 1k they are worth.
Hope we can get along now.

This afternoon I would like to see Adrian since it’s been well over a week since we have had time together. But you count skiing w/ him as work, that
is not “quality time”. Unlike my coaching. And I have no way to discuss as you don’t answear OFW anymore.
Another week passes. Another week of complete and utter parental alienation. I understand in your mind it’s justified and even though we were all

mentally abusing our children as you work your way to the bottom of the barrel because no professional, child focused professional supports your
side. Opinion shop all you like, but it’s still ongoing mental abuse.
Your story and justification for child abuse has twisted and evolved since July. Booze, mushrooms (you did), DV, multiple accusations of monitoring
(8?). This is all while you maintain drop in functionality on me, and persist in sending me alerts on what’s happening on your network that I have
asked you to stop for months to falsely say I’m monitoring you. You won’t stop.
That is pretty much the totality of what happened unless you want to dig deeper on the incident that triggered your change of tune from the “Alyssa
model” to “Sherman’s March to the Sea”. So as you and your child focused attorney focus on a solution that stops the child abuse you continue to
justify I’m not confident in your ability to make sound decisions.
They say “3rd times the charm”, right? Well this will be the 7th time. And that’s if your higher wisdom is accepted as canon law with zero negotiation
back with a parent that has the same legal rights you have. May I suggest you pause your child abuse until you come down from the mount with the
stone tablets from god? Or google searches and your lawyer.
You realize this could never be a movie. People would walk out after the third try because the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th would seem so abusive to the
kids and implausible in real life it would be a waste of time to sit through. Unfortunately our kids are not only sitting through it, they are living it. I
look forward to the explanation and education for why this is healthy.

Please don’t cherry pick professional advice. I have an equal number of professional advices that guarantee we were in a system. That also say the way
that you unilaterally blame me for what has transpired in our marriage does not make sense. They have also pointed out after speaking with you that
you were setting traps for me just to make a self fulfilling prophecy appear to be true.
We can opinion shop till we find the ones that we agree with or you and I can just choose to start this over and be friendly to each other I’ll point out
that you telling me to get help is the equivalent of what you asked me not to tell you to do so please don’t do that either. If you indeed have a therapist
that says only one person took party in this marriage of 25 years and relationship of 30 years. Please send them my way today. I will call them today.
I’d also point out that you don’t trust mental health professionals, opinions when they disagree with you. You only go with the ones that suit your
narrative. And then you read the Internet and turn to your lawyer for professional mental health advice.  So please quit doing that. I’m going to
reiterate again if you and I could have a couple minutes today just to chat we could start the day on a good foot. Please consider.

I did not say crazy.
I said the therapists we/I have spoken to over course of many years raised serious concerns regarding conduct and safety.
Me and kids are now engaged with therapists to address the impact on overall mental and emotional wellbeing, how to heal, and how to structure
future support to be safe.
In regards to Therapists that raised serious concerns. There was a variation of feedback strongly advising the need for legal police intervention.
How to structure plans moving forward is now being directly addressed to ensure complete safety.
Conversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he communicated to her in an honest and open environment was
incredibly brave and I need to respect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made it clear to me if she believes
he is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That is her obligation.
This is similar to the obligation Yurishka was put in. You have a different perspective, but professionals have a duty to act when they are made aware
of certain situations.
AnnaLisa will be talking to Lisa. How we move forward will be dependent on how you receive the information and what you believe will be in best
interest of boys. We will see.

That said, what I said yesterday I meant. The kids we brought into this world with so much hope for forever as a happy family, are still our number
one priority.
I’m % committed to the best for them. It’s just a matter of figuring out who represents their “voice” best since they don’t seem to say the same thing!
And I really hope we can put our differences aside long enough to be the best we can be for their benefit. They didn’t ask for this and don’t deserve it.

And I’m trying to honestly figure out who said visits have to be supervised. We always look at their qualifications together, and consider how well
they know our kids. So please share the expertise.
I mean after all, who would’ve thought that Dr. Brown was not qualified? She met with us over 10 times in 3 1/2 months. Did two parenting plans

Also... Nanna has obviously been asking to see the boys since long before your girls trip to New York. Remember, we were going to try and time it so
you were out of town, but you killed that. And of course we see The Moyers every year. Both Michael and Robyn and Beth are regular visits. We
always go visit our extended family.
So given that you took the boys to go visit your whole family and then made a decision to divorce me after talking to your mom, when do the boys get
to see my side of the family? Obviously, if it requires you, that’s fine. I took your whole family to Whistler and had an amazing time. It works great!
Given we both are really trying to work hard to make sure the boys have the best and most supportive family experience, but they have been utterly
cut off from my family while I’ve enabled yours, please build that into the parenting plan.

Speaking of replacements, since you decided to cancel my Cabo trip in October then banked my credit for the room during the best week of the entire
year, please advise when you will book an equivalent experience for me. I’d like to get that sorted pretty quickly. And given that you’ve taken all the
time to go ahead and book more Cabo vacations for yourself, I’m sure you can make this a priority.
I’m gonna tell you an advance, I don’t really care to hear about “subject to availability” issues that you may face. My vacation in October was not
subject to availability. I paid over 50 K to have that week not ever have a “subject to availability” issue. You took that from me. So “subject to
availability” may be your problem. But please do not expect to make it my problem.
Obviously, I don’t wanna go in the hot months of summer. I will be expecting something at peak and of equivalent value. So as a favor to you , I am
open to also discussing replacing that by staying at another place of equal or greater value. Maybe like the one you just did in California. I know you
mentioned it was a five star resort that reminded you a lot of Grand Solmar....
For that matter, we have pretty clear accounting of all your luxury travels here and abroad over the last year. So you should have some really good
ideas. Looking forward to solving this in a peaceful, constructive and equitable way like we did the Sonos.

Thanks for considering either just sitting beside each other or texting during live events like sports, school activities, etc. as being able to communicate
in real time about the things that we are seeing, allows us to make better parenting decisions for the kids future. I will also assure you that, we will limit
it to just that time and just that topic.
But I’ll also call out how successful we were today in coordinating for Adrian when we had an open, two-way communication channel. I’m not gonna
beat a dead horse and point this out to you again, but we seem to have a win on important issue every week when we just stop, chat, agree on action
items, and just get shit done. Never fails.
Looking forward to confirmation of how you would like to do this moving forward. It’s that important.
———————- Notes I sent to AD ———————-
So, really great play tonight. I like seeing you make more friends with the guys there and it’s obvious you’re getting a little more comfortable. That
allows you to play a little bit looser and with a little bit more confidence. That mental part is super important.
Your hustle was really strong, you get through the picks very quickly, and you understand when a ball handler needs a pick set for himself. You even
had a couple good give and goes flashing under the hoop. Of course, one of those led to an easy basket.

The other thing I really like is your feeling more comfortable about taking your outside shot ( >10 feet. ) From the baseline is always going to be
difficult but it’s something we can work on. It’s a great weapon to have in your bag when you can just nail that.
I also think it would be super to spend some time in either training clinics or camps soon to work on ball handling. With your Hoops IQ, along with
being smaller and quicker, you’re gonna be most successful at either the one or two slot. So let’s train for that.
Keep up the great work, Adrian. You’re doing awesome and it’s amazing to watch you grow as a player and a young man every week.
You really make me proud.

Not pointing fingers. I’m trying to co-parent. This one landed after 11:30 pm. So not sure if we need to see if someone is sneaking up past his
bedtime.
Please don’t make me the bad guy. These alerts are doing just what they are supposed to be doing, so parents can be sure kids are playing by the rules.
All this shit was set up with good intentions so you and I, as responsible parents could use technology and appearances to protect our family and
property.

I’m not putting any details of what just happened into this message because that would be seen as inflammatory and counter  productive to my
sincere efforts, and outreach to try and work constructively with you. I understand the perspective and will do my best to avoid giving you the
impressions you seem to be concerned about. You will see that reflected in my heartfelt communications.
If we have to go through our capable attorneys, our kids will feel a real impact. We have three examples of serious consequences that would have
occurred with Adrian in the last ten days. So I’m asking again, please let me know how we can work together instead of against each other. Let’s find a
way to activate that superpower we shared for three decades.
This is not working and only getting worse. Let’s stop the slide.

Here is why I thought it was ICS. If we have a SAAS opportunity soon, we should put on our big boy pants and go together. They helped us in a real
time of need. We don’t need to pay a lot of money, but we should at least be present imho.

Can we just make time w/o the kids around, tomorrow. The last opportunity you really gave me to chat was months ago when I wanted to salvage our
marriage. I’m over that. It does not taint my perspective anymore.
When I heard you today I had serious heartfelt feelings for the woman who I have know for 30 years, gave me three wonderful kids, showed me love
better than I ever deserved, and should not spend another moment with this hate.
Please, I’ve asked for months. We don’t need to go couch shopping or glass blowing, but we have to find a way to simply find the humanity in each
other again. Nothing grander than that. Just recognize each other civilly and respectfully.
May we sit together tomorrow? Quietly if need be. We can start with silence and work our way up to kind and constructive questions. You and I can
accomplish anything in this world we put our mind to. Let’s start with being decent to one another.

Understood. I was trying to reach out and be kind.In return, may I ask that when we are in front of the kids you stop screaming at me.
Yesterday, like you always did when I was in Bellevue on the Adrian drop offs, you started screaming at me yesterday in front of Max.
With Adrian, you would get out of the car and start yelling at me despite Dr. Brown’s advice that that should never happen with him there.
Yesterday, you demanded therapist names. I said I would speak to Lisa so you pointed your finger and started screaming “we are at war.”
This was with Max, right after a therapy session to check in on how he is doing. In my opinion this causes extreme parental alienation and damage.
I will no longer request you to be peaceful, civil, or constructive given your request. I will however ask you to stop these outbursts in front of our kids.
Thanks for your consideration in the best interest of their mental health.

Documenting what you are saying below is a false narrative.
Just because you say it does not mean it to be true.
I have asked on multiple occasions not for us to talk anytime. You refuse and continuing demand I do so and even come and insist to sit next to me or
will find me and insist you stand next to me.
It makes me feel emotional and physically unsafe.
You will follow me to the car despite my protests and repeatedly request/demand I meet you or discuss a topic. This is often followed up by an e-mail
requesting the same which is documented.
I say NO repeatedly.
DO NOT SIT NEXT TO ME, FOLLOW ME TO THE CAR, ASK ME TO TALK at any of the events.
