  "text": "Message 2116 of 4024\nNot sure you have time, but I’ve tried to stay on top of SAAS today. AD is up to date, knows about Tues &\nWed, has his class schedule, knows what to bring and what to expect in study hall.\nI also an acknowledged the Study Skills enrollment and the expected associated cost. Next step is another email from Catherine to set up a\nFamily Partnership Meeting.\nLet me know if you have questions or concerns. I’m not trying to step on toes but I can help keep this plate spinning while you focus elsewhere.\nbest...\nSent:03/11/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 04:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS\nMessage 2117 of 4024\nWe have a fundamental difference of opinion on how to proceed.\nThis is not AnnaLisa speaking.\nI have now fully dug into the implications and potential outcomes for different paths, and am realizing what has transpired and the control and\ncoercion you have tried to assert on me through this process, for a certain path. The genuine fear I operate on to soothe things or not get you upset or\nangry. The need for the RO as recent as January, is a demonstration of that dynamic, and yet you act as if that was not serious or your actions did not\nreally warrant one based on your continued assertions that your story is correct.\nYour reference to $$$ spent is another scare tactic to acquiesce to your desire to structure everything to maximize your outcome, which does not\nprovide the real protection to me and boys or provide the true and acknowledge what transpired in the marriage and family dynamic. If the truth is\nnot revealed, I have lost that protection.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 04:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: $$$ Today $$$\nMessage 2118 of 4024\nId like to understand what you are saying. I don’t get what you mean. I am not trying to scare you in the least. I am trying to work with you.\nThe RO that I offered and the apologies I made are real and authentic. Please stop saying the opposite of what I am confirming in writing again here.\nMay we please talk about this? I have assured you that I won’t argue. I just want to understand your perspective so we can partner safely for the kids.\nMay you please explain. I’m all ears. Honestly.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 04:26 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 06:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: $$$ Today $$$",
