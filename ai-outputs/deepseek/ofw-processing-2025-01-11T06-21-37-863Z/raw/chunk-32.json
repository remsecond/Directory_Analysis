Then\nwhen she fixes the wrong RO she can make the change one time.\nJust like we were doing with Dr. Brown, if we do not adhere to the guidelines provided we revert back to the prior phase. This will incentivize us to\nboth make it work and be constructive and helpful moving forward.\nWhatever you do, I am asking you please to take the 10 minutes we spoke of earlier today, spend it on this,\nthink about it, and let me know. I hope this is a reasonable compromise that you feel good about.\nPlease give me a call for 5 min if you have concerns.\nThanks!\nMessage 1626 of 4024\nThank you for outlining below.\nI am extremely concerned and have been advised against texts and calls given the demonstrated history of harassment, anger and bullying, for topics\nthat are unrelated to parenting. This was not just my lawyer but Dr. Brown as well.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 08:51 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 08:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
