Maybe this will\nwork better.\nSo obviously I’ve seen nothing. I told you that.\nAnd so we can work together, who said the conditions of a visit had to be supervised? And when can Lisa and I speak with them for details around the\ndecision?\nGiven they are the sole therpist with that pov, it will be good to know more about how they got there. It might even be worth an 8th opinion as well.\nAgree?\nI’ll jump right on it if you let me know tonight. I already have some leads! Looking forward to validating the right decisions together as co-parents.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 06:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 06:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2251 of 4024\nPlease provide names of the 5 therapists you have referenced.\nSent:03/21/2024 at 06:58 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/21/2024 at 06:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still No Word\nMessage 2252 of 4024\nAny update on details?
