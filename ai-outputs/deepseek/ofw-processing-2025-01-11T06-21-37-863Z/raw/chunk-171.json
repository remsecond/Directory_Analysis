If your position is the RO was frivolous and safety protections\nnot warranted, then it will be a point of contention at mediation, which undermines my position.\nI’m going to go over my proposed changes for PP with my lawyer and next steps.\nIf we are truly at an impasse for PP, then I’ll find out next steps.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 10:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 10:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2098 of 4024\nAs mentioned, I’m not sure, but I am 90% sure Lisa sent our copy signed to Annalisa when she asked her to sign for your side and file with the court.\nHowever, my assumption may be wrong. But based on prior history, that typically is the case. I think we can agree there.\nI am not requesting you file charges. I can’t make that clearer. I have never claimed \"a RO\" was frivolous. We suggested an RO that prevented digital\nsurveillance. You came back with an RO that cut off all constructive communication methods and channels. That may have been over the top.\nYou focused instead on allowing no emails, phone calls, or texts even for emergencies. It was for child-related issues only; with no allowance initially\nfor anything else. You also added I was a \"credible threat\" to physically beat you guys out of the blue. That is not at all about monitoring.\nSo there should be no contention in mediation. You raised monitoring as an issue. We tried to solve the issue you raised. You chose to add things to it,\nusing the RO as a vehicle for other issues. I think we both can see and agree that I don't beat my kids now or ever, but it was filed.\nI expect you to go over the PP with Annalisa and know things will get MUCH WORSE. It happens every time. So, we are at the impasse we tried to\navoid. The only remedy is using Dr Brown, who we chose for that reason. Otherwise, we could have been at this same impasse in October.\nIf you want to discuss I am open to it. But I have said \"what I am saying\" so please don't tell me I'm saying something else. If you feel anything I am\nsaying is incorrect or inflammatory, it is not my intent. I hope it is pretty uncontroversial. I will chat if you like to bring the temp down on this\nI really, sincerely, honestly hope with all my heart NOT to step on a landmine with one of my words. I honestly wish I was bringing you poke with\nfresh avocados, lemon, and fruit for lunch to openly and honestly talk about what needs to happen next. I wish we had done that then.\nPlease have a great day. I am not going to flame you.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 10:56 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 10:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nMessage 2099 of 4024\nPlease see attached... Again, I could be wrong. But this is what I see in my mailbox to Annalisa.\nSent:03/11/2024 at 11:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/11/2024 at 11:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent\nAttachments:2024-2-23_Letter_to_AnnaLisa_Danysh__4863-4907-0760___1_.docx (90 KB)",
