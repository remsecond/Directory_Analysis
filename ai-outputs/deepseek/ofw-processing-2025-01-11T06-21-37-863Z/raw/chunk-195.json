  "text": "Message 2154 of 4024\nInterrogative statements are noted with the symbol \"?\" at the end of the sentence. If you look at that symbol and work backward, you will see that I\ndid not ask for anything about Max. I actually asked, \"So, I do nothing now?\" Mind letting me know on the 4th try now?\nAlso, per the thoughts on Max noted below, are we following the Dr Brown plan as you propose to assert here? The last I saw was that you were\nrejecting that and were coming up with a plan based on your internet browsing instead of Dr Brown's professional advice.\nLetting me know what you are doing might be helpful for the children's sake.\nRegarding your plan, I'd also like to know when I will actually see Adrian again.\nPlease advise on since you brought up the topic. Looking to co-parent with you.\nThanks!\nSent:03/14/2024 at 02:10 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 05:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Robotics/Breakfast\nMessage 2155 of 4024\nbtw- I’d still like to know the answers to my questions, but I don’t need to be snarky. I’m just so frustrated that we were doing so amazing just a week\nback.

How do we\nalways get worse and never build on our wins?\nSent:03/14/2024 at 03:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 05:44 PM)\nSubject:Re: Robotics/Breakfast\nMessage 2156 of 4024\n.\nSent:03/14/2024 at 08:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/14/2024 at 10:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_1955.PNG (7 MB)\nMessage 2157 of 4024\nGood Morning-\nI can't seem to get an answer from you on almost anything we are trying to do together, so I pulled some of the most pressing concerns into one of our\nfamiliar \"running list\" formats that works well for us. Please see below. I do need some things answered today. Have a great day!\nRobotics Breakfast- I signed up for this and would like to coordinate in existing 3rd party emails but I can't reply.
