Communication between parties is limited to the Our Family Wizard solely\nfor the purpose of co-parenting. No specific emergency communication protocol is mentioned. That is why I had it added to my version.\nPlease let me know if I am missing something and I do apologize if I have.\nthanks!\nSent:03/09/2024 at 08:16 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 08:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: Emergency\nAttachments:Moyer_-_Temporary_Restraining_Order__4853-3274-6400___1_.pdf (552 KB)\nMessage 1997 of 4024\nThe updated RO needs to be executed.\nWe restricted to OFW unless you want to violate it.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 08:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Emergency\nMessage 1998 of 4024\n\"We have clear protocols for emergencies. Review the RO.\" - Christine Moyer\nI am well aware of what needs to happen next. My point was you said we had it but we don't. I have been trying to get an update that accommodates\nthis scenario for months.\n• My point was you are going 13 hours w/o checking in for a child-related emergency.\n• Your response was we have a protocol, and I should read the RO and not harass you.\n• My response is that I did. And as I said, there is no emergency protocol in the RO.\n• Your response is not to agree you were wrong, but to point out we need a new RO.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 09:04 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 09:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Emergency",
