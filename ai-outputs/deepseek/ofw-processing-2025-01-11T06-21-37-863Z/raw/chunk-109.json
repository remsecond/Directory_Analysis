I’ll\nbe the bad guy for our greater good. I just want to be happy again and give the kids what they really need to thrive (and that goes for you too. I really\nstill love you!)\nMessage 1893 of 4024\nMy thoughts are we re start time with Adrian with overnights every other week.\nThis Friday both he and Max are off. I was invited to a birthday party and could bring kids but option is you have Adrian Friday plus overnight\nthrough Saturday and drop off evening Saturday. I have him for ski Sunday.\nMax has robotics competition Saturday which I planned to attend in afternoon after Adrian basketball.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 05:15 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 05:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\nMessage 1894 of 4024\nThanks... what about today?

We are in a situation where he has 3 more Sundays for\nski. This week it would be equivalent as you would have Friday and Saturday.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 06:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 06:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan",
