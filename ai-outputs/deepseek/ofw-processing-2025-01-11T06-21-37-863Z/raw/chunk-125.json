  "text": "Message 1949 of 4024\nNo, it’s not an emergency or urgent.\nThis is my struggle. You push to violate the terms of the RO and will weaponize.\nI’m not going to try to persuade you. You are no, so it’s no.\nNothing urgent so i plan to refocus my energies tonight.\nThank you\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:38 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1950 of 4024\nThis is disappointing. This is a very serious conversation we need to have today or tomorrow and we are in complete disagreement about what it\nmeans to what we just did\nIf you don’t understand that, lineup his rules for communication side-by-side with what we established today. Do me a favor and tell me if they look\nalike. Both methods and platforms.\nIt’s simply much more effective to have a five minute conversation than a OFW thread an email thread and us bickering back-and-forth. We proved\nthat six times in four days this week.\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1951 of 4024\nBy the way, since you said, I was a “no” and I’ve asked you to quit putting words in my mouth every single day, can you just send me where I said\n“no”\nSent:03/07/2024 at 06:42 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/07/2024 at 06:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Andy\nMessage 1952 of 4024\nI’m not going to try persuade you. You have concerns. I’m not here to persuade you.
