  "text": "Message 2003 of 4024\nI’m going to try and do a better job of remembering our history. You were not always my antagonist. For three decades, we smiled, we laughed, we\ncried, we walked on the beach hand- in-hand, we sweated and we snuggled toes together.\nThe entire time as parents, never with a moment to ourselves as partners. I need to acknowledge our accomplishments and show our long history the\nrespect and gratitude it deserves.\nSent:03/09/2024 at 10:25 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/09/2024 at 11:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Emergency\nMessage 2004 of 4024\nThere is.
