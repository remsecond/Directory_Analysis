His leg is hurt from a kid pushing him against a table.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 03:42 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 03:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\nMessage 1574 of 4024\nOk. Thanks! Appreciate the update. I trust you.\nFeel free to include me in decisions so you don’t have to be the gatekeeper for “Adrian access” now that we have a plan again. I’m more than happy to\nengage like I’m actually his dad. I would have offered him to come play NCAA for a couple hours since it was his Xmas gift and he has not had it for\nsix weeks.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 04:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\nMessage 1575 of 4024\nPlease make sure you get it on Adrian‘s knee as quickly as possible. If he is not able to come to practice, he should have that iced to prevent further\nswelling and irritation that will limit the time to heal.\nI am more than happy to sit and explain to you when you use heat and when you use cold to help get you better in the case of soft tissue issues.\nTreating it properly as soon as possible makes a big difference.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 04:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 06:12 PM)\nSubject:Ice\nMessage 1576 of 4024\nStill going strong\nSent:02/23/2024 at 05:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 06:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_1588.PNG (3 MB)\nMessage 1577 of 4024\nDo you have time to discuss the parenting plan update? I won't make a passive-aggressive comment even though I have a thousand running through\nmy head.  I would like to constructively work with you now your criteria for an updated parenting plan have been met.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 08:10 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/24/2024 at 09:05 AM)\nSubject:Your Availabilty",
