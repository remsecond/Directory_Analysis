  "text": "It would be much better if you and I were in therapy. We would have a greater chance of success if that was possible, but she says you are not able to\ndo that so we can’t. Hence the current plan. But you won’t try.\nWe are not doing the best thing for anyone. We are only doing the best thing you are capable of. I’d like to try and do more, and will do it with a\nprofessional. Hell, I’ll even let Dr Brown do it. What do you think?\nMessage 1637 of 4024\nWhy are you even bringing it up?? It makes me sick. You use it to humiliate and traumatize me.\nYour track record is you do share it with anyone that will listen when you feel wronged or angry.\nYou brought it up to your entire family when I discovered your affair all those years ago. It was a false narrative to get them to think I somehow\ncondoned your behaviour or you were confused. Every single one as your excuse. You screamed it to John and Lisa. You have never been a gentleman\nabout it  and the feedback to me was one of disgust that you would share that. It’s disgusting.\nYou  brought it up with Elsa.\nYou have a demonstrated history and pattern. It’s disgusting.\nIt is humiliating to have that shared and you weaponized it. You weaponized everything that why I stopped doing anything with you that could\nremotely be used and weaponized against me.\nI will just share that when you do share those details, people think badly of you that you would try humiliate me versus your intended goal of trying to\nmake you the victim or pity on you. If you think people think I’m the crazy one, just think if you were listening to someone share such intimate details\nabout their partner at the time. It would be one of betrayal and disgust.\nThe same will hold true when we step into mediation and your story of not being employed for a year while I bust my ass, manage the kids full time\nwhile you bombard me with crazy and create unsafe condition s that require you to physically leave the state. Documented 100 plus unanswered calls\nand texts repeatedly. Everyone in those rooms will be holding down a full time job, while you complain of having a partner leave you after 25 years of\nalcoholism and DV. Let’s see how much sympathy that generates.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:56 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1638 of 4024\nI can’t submit your insurance claims. That is documented and I have told you repeatedly.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 10:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Amex",
