  "text": "Unbelievable Robert!\nMessage 1629 of 4024\nWTF are you talking about? This is not for documentation sake this is you and I having an honest and truthful discussion about our past. I’m not\ntrying to pin anything on you. I was there. I shared it with you when we were in love. You can try and deny all the good times and all the things we did\ntogether Christine, but it was very real and our love was very real and I’m crying as I scream that into this phone. Why do you have to deny our past\nwhen you use it as the reason to hate me so much?\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1630 of 4024\nThere are charges on your Amex that I have no idea if legitimate like all this msft charges that you said you would indicate was fraud.\nI also saw charges from Debbie in 820 plus more in Jan etc. are you getting reimbursed through insurance? For Louis too? I have no control over your\ninsurance any more. I assume you did Yurushka which was over 1k. There are time limits for submission for 2023 charges. Given you have time to\nwrite pages of emails to me, and complain relentlessly about finances and spend and my ability to respond as I wlork 10 hour plus days,, a 5 min\nphone call to insurance must have been done.\nAre you checking the charges at all to verify?\nI have no visibility to what you are doing so I have no idea if they are legitimate at all. That’s on you to monitor and verify.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:35 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:35 PM)\nSubject:Amex\nMessage 1631 of 4024\nWhy do you have to bring it up and write it down? Why? Why? Why? For what purpose?\nThis has nothing to do with parenting but you just bringing up things that you know will cause me distress.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:36 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1632 of 4024\nI have not done anything. I told you I did not know how to do it. You were well aware of that.\nSent:02/25/2024 at 09:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/25/2024 at 09:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: Amex",
