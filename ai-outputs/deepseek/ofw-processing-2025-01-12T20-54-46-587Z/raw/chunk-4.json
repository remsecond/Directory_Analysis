Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands with me.\nI don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads. Thats all.\nIf both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what he\ndoes.\nI hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming\npersonal.",
