He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How\nshould I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?\nI think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally\ndeciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.\nWere you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really\ncan’t think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 01:42 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nIs the partial answer intentional?\nYou didn’t really answer the question.
