Could you send that over?\nIf you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.\nThank you.\nMessage 257 of 287\nSo I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we can’t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or compliance folks\nalways on the thread for personal stuff.
