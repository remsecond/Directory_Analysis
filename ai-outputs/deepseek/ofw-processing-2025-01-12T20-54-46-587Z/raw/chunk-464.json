Is it just wait\ntill we both know they are missing AND you check OFW? Curious.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:01 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:AD is asleep\nDoes he know he’s coming over?\nLast Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said\nyou won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was\nkinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of\nclown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nMessage 279 of 287\nStepping away. Thanks!\nHave a nice weekend.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 04:21 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nOn 12/28/2024 at 04:06 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 04:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nPlease share with your therapist and Cimberleigh and perhaps they can provide feedback directly.\nI dont feel comfortable doing that directly with you.\nIn discussions with her she had not received Connor’s report yet per pp. Has Luis?\nOn 12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 04:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nI don’t know what my jab was but if there was one, please point it out so I don’t do it again and accept my apologies.
