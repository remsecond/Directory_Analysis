Could you send that over?\nIf you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.\nThank you.\nMessage 256 of 287\nSo I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth across\nplatforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.\nI will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that this is\nsuper frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.\nSent:12/26/2024 at 02:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/27/2024 at 03:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOn 12/26/2024 at 01:52 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2024 at 01:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nMy BofA is\nAccount: 13833331026\nRouting: 125000024\nI see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.",
