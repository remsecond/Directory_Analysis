It’s a 30 second call but I wait hours. You know I’m going to respond because I have\nmilliseconds at best, but you do this anyway.\nI finally got us on a call today and overcame weeks of bickering and crossed wires. It got the exact outcome you asked for, most in real time. So I\ncan’t understand why you don’t see that it works for you too.\nIs working with me for the kids just beneath you?\nOn 12/13/2024 at 07:49 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nIs that what is arranged?\nOn 12/13/2024 at 07:39 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:41 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nHe should be fine for tomorrow at 9:15 pick up\nOn 12/13/2024 at 05:52 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again.

I don’t like being the\n“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.\nThis makes me feel uncomfortable.\nOn 12/13/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI don’t know?
