I have a very long list of things I have not seen a response on. How do we address that since this is a one way street and you refuse to\naccommodate the way we addressed every issue you had at this exact time last week? Instead, you got all your answers and then said “I’m not\ndoing that.”\nAdrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.\nAnd given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on\nthat! I see him in less than two hours. It is always this way with you.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 01:07 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nAttachments:IMG_2493.PNG (129 KB)\nI did not see a response for OFW sent on Dec 17.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 08:34 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nI see Adrian today.

After considering my input, then you can then make the final\ndecision based on your authority.\nFor something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't\nexpect that formality, but I'd like to confer.",
