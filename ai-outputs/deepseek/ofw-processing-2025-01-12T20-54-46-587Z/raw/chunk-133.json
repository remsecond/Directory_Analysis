  "text": "But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are\nabout that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.\nIt was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were\n“real kids.”\nThis is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than\nthat.\nIt’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m\nasking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a\ncompassionate and durable decision.\nThis is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 03:48 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nYou had it. You choose not to use it. I have all versions. No free will for Adrian, total and complete free will for Max was not in his plan. You\ntook Adrian’s agency away through adulthood. You can’t change what you did and will need to live with that.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 03:46 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 03:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nWe had Connor’s plan too.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 09:53 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 03:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed\nthat. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well\nwhen he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:",
