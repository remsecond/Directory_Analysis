  "text": "• Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n• Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n• Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n• The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian\nthe free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also\ncould create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till\nadulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.",
