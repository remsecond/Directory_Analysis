We\nhave discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.\nWhen I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the\nlanguage used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.\nI am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in \"gotcha accounting\" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I\nsuggested so we can do this in a constructive way.\nOn 12/01/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 06:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nSure. And I assure you that I will work on this prior to mediation. I want us to have a crack at it. I’m not trying to surprise you, I’m trying to\nwork with you.\nOn 12/01/2024 at 03:03 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 03:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nOk. Will discuss in mediation unless you get feedback from Lisa prior, my interpretation is correct and you will pay that amount.\nThank you\nOn 12/01/2024 at 11:04 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 02:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nThat feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands\nwith me.\nI don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.\nThats all.\nIf both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what\nhe does.\nI hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming\npersonal.",
