I am running some numbers.\nToday we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the\nnext bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.\n<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>\n• Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)\n• Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)\n• The equalization payment tax treatment\n• Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis\nBut before I do this, will you even consider a \"Jan 01\" sale instead if it saves us some money?",
