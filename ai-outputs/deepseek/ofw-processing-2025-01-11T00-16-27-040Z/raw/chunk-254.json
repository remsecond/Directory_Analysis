There was a trade off.\nYou spent 170k more than me while unemployed . Refused to pay me maintenance and argued for small child support, refusing to pay bills owed\nincluding max medical. I’m in the red every month.\nSent:12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nSo this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first\nmeetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I\nfeel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on\nthe scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been\nused for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,\nand you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t\nreciprocated when it came to dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,\nand ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the\nIRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so\nhard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even\nhave this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?\nThen it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.\nIf you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.\nIs that correct?",
