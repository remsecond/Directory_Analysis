But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like\nretaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:\n• Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.",
