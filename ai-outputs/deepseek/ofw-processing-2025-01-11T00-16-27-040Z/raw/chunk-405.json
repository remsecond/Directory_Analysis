Could you send that over?\nIf you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.\nThank you.\nMessage 245 of 287\nAh... it had to come from Fidelity... to BofA.\nThat’s probably right. I sent the details in email.\nI also asked if that was ok but you didn’t answer.\nSent:12/25/2024 at 04:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2024 at 04:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOn 12/25/2024 at 04:35 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2024 at 04:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOk I checked BofA for the jt account and still don’t see it but perhaps after holidays.\nOn 12/25/2024 at 02:19 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2024 at 04:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nIt’s in the kids BofA\nOn 12/25/2024 at 02:18 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/25/2024 at 02:18 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nThank you.
