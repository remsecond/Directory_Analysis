An OFW at 3:30pm harassing me when I did my part and with your lawyers is inappropriate. Your\npattern continues.\nSent:12/16/2024 at 03:48 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 04:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Parent Coordinator\nOn 12/16/2024 at 03:30 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 03:41 PM)\nSubject:Parent Coordinator\nWhose attorney is holding us up?

I knew Lisa sent you something around noon. Good to hear you replied at 1:00. That is all I was asking. I'm going to ignore the bluster and\naccusations. That is not helpful.\nAll I asked to know was where the bottleneck was so I could apply pressure if it's me. Yet another perfect example of why it's best if we, as Public\nEnemy, sang \"Take the Power Back.\"\nSent:12/16/2024 at 04:14 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 05:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Parent Coordinator",
