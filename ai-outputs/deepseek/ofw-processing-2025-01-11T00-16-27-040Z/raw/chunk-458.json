  "text": "• The portrayal to Adrian that I \"won't reply\" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.\n• Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.\n• The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.\nPlease maintain our message thread rather than forking and creating new ones. Forking threads can misrepresent the context and chronology of\nour communication, which has happened a lot since this began. I don't think that is helpful to either of us when seeking helpful advice.\nLooking forward to understanding a healthier way to address the points above, as they were not addressed in a constructive way.\nrobert\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:45 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 09:49 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep\nI’ll  send this to Cimberleigh.

Is it just wait\ntill we both know they are missing AND you check OFW? Curious.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:01 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:AD is asleep\nDoes he know he’s coming over?\nLast Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said\nyou won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was\nkinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of\nclown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nMessage 275 of 287\nThese comms are not to air grievances.\nYes if you can reimburse the costs from July for kids medical insurance.and other costs that would be great too.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks ticket sale",
