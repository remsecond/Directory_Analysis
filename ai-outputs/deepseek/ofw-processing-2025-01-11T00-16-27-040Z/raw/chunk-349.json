Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we\ncould keep our running list format.\nNow issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list\nmeeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.\nI want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest\nsomething better than what we know works.\nHappy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to\npush back on something that clearly does not.\nOur inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need\nthe help you have refused for over a year now.\nI don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for\nsomething different. I want “>31” instead.\nPlease stop the crazy. Let’s work together.\nMessage 195 of 287\nPlease share this communication with Sound Practices.\nGiven you have refused to acknowledge any DV and are challenging Connor’s report, this  terrifies me your state of mind and how you continue to\ncommunicate with me.\nI will wait for Caroline to onboard.\nSent:12/17/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nOn 12/17/2024 at 03:41 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nJust reviewed what you demanded. That is super unfortunate. As I was trying to turn over a new leaf with you based on the \">31\" you and\nNatalie actually went for a much deeper and more draconian solution. Making it fully impossible to communicate. Unfortunate, given how\nwell OFW only has worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.\nIt's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you\njust let me, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.)
