Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?\nThen you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?\nOr alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.\nIs this what was decided last week?\nOn 12/14/2024 at 02:46 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/14/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI’ll just wait to see if I hear from you so we can make the best decision for Adrian.
