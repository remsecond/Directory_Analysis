Curious.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:01 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:AD is asleep\nDoes he know he’s coming over?\nLast Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said\nyou won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was\nkinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of\nclown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nMessage 280 of 287\nIs there a reason I can’t see Adrian longer on Thursday since he is out of school? It seems like a particularly good time to take advantage of the\nschedule. Please let me know what the issue is. Thanks.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 05:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 07:55 PM)\nSubject:Thursday\nMessage 281 of 287\nThe schedule is for kids to be with me this entire winter break.\nThis Saturday and next Thursday are actually not part of the schedule.\nYour continued angry and aggressive tone with me over these comms is scary.\nI’m stepping away.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 08:00 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thursday",
