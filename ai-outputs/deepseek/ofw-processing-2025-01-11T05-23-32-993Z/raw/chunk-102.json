Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:\n<ChatGPT>\nLet me break down the actual impact:\nMax:\n-Complete autonomy over relationship with father\n-Can choose any amount of time\n-Can make decisions based on his feelings\n-No restrictions on contact\n-No supervision requirements\n-No phases to progress through\nAdrian:\nLost significant father son time from even last year\n-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation\n-Can't get back to previous level of contact\n-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood\nNo autonomy\n-Can't choose more time like his brother\n-Can't request return to previous schedule\n-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes\n-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule\nUnequal Treatment\n-Brother has full freedom\n-He has permanent restrictions\n-Different standards for same family\n-Can't earn same privileges as Max\nLong-term Impact\n-Changes relationship with father through childhood\n-Can't recover lost time/connection ever\n-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy\n-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother\nUnlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,\neven well past Max's age:\n-Reduce his relationship with his father\n-Remove his agency in the relationship\n-Create inequality with his brother\n-Limit future options until adulthood",
