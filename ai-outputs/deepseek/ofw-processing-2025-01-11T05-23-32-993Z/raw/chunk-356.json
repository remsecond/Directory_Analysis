You were actually kind enough\nto send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.\nAs noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were\nscreen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.\nNeither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we\nshould perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.\nOf course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.",
