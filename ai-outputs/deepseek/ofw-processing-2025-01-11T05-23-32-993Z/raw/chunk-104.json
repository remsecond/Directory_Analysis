  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 50 of 287\nI am asking to talk  tonight before it goes to court. That is why it has to be tonight. If one call in four months (a rate of 3 a year) is too much for\nsomething of this magnitude. Then there will never be anything that meets the bar.\nIf you don’t let me chat , you see blame, because that is what you are making up. I am not blaming you. I am asking for a peaceful and constructive\ndiscussion. May we please take a minute to even check if\nIt’s worth a longer conversation.\nJust putting our heads in the sand won’t help him.\nSent:12/08/2024 at 05:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 05:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nOn 12/08/2024 at 04:54 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nI do understand you have a different perspective.\nThis is still too raw. My suggestion is we step back for a bit. All I see is blame on me.\nThis has been signed is my understanding.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 04:33 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nWould you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly\nwhen we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.",
