My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what\nLisa view on this as this will impact future drops.\nThank you\nMessage 190 of 287\nYou have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we could\nkeep our running list format.\nNow issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list\nmeeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.\nI want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest\nsomething better than what we know works.\nHappy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to push\nback on something that clearly does not.\nOur inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need the\nhelp you have refused for over a year now.\nI don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for\nsomething different. I want “>31” instead.\nSent:12/17/2024 at 12:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Running List",
