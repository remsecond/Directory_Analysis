I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for\nthe wrong things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.\nThe gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when\nyou said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a\nmistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.\nIf you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim\nexample. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?\nSo I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”\nOn 12/17/2024 at 02:56 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nWe have to use OFW.\nThe running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.\nSaying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context of what was happening.\nThe DV was real and confirmed.\nYou have all info and feedback on finances as requested.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 12:55 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Running List\nYou have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we\ncould keep our running list format.\nNow issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list\nmeeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.\nI want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest\nsomething better than what we know works.\nHappy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to\npush back on something that clearly does not.\nOur inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need\nthe help you have refused for over a year now.\nI don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well.
