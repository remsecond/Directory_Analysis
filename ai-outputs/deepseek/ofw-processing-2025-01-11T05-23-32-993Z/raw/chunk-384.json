  "text": "Thank you.\nMessage 227 of 287\nSo....\nI am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it up, and I\nthink you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.\nI don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a sleepover.\nThis year, there is nothingâ€”not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.\nI hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?\nMerry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.\nrobert\nSent:12/24/2024 at 09:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 11:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nOn 12/24/2023 at 08:13 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2023 at 08:28 PM)\nSubject:No Response Requested\nAttachments:IMG_0622.jpg (5 MB)\nJust wanted to let you know we did good.\nSome awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad.
