  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 53 of 287\nAllright. I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can do\nwhatever you want to him.\nI just noted earlier you had said that \"Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his\ncommunications to others, not just me.\"\nSo given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free will.\nAD and his voice will be silent.\nSent:12/08/2024 at 05:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 12:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today",
