  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 59 of 287\nI sincerely apologize if you feel this is abuse. I was just trying to let you know the facts, because you keep saying everything had been submitted. I\nthought you would appreciate it. I will step away and you can believe whatever you like. Have a good day.\nSent:12/09/2024 at 12:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: It has not been entered into court\nOn 12/09/2024 at 12:29 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 12:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: It has not been entered into court\nThis is abusive.\nYour lawyer sent over docs so unsure what game you are playing.",
