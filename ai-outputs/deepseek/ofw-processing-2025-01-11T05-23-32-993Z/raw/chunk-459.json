That is most of my life, and I have to start all over now. And I still\ncan't get you to even work with me on rebuilding and being civil—even for the kid's sake.\nI have asked every way I know how. I know you have a lot of anger, but you slept on the pillow next to me for 25 years and talked about\ngrowing old together. But every night was a lie. Our whole life was a lie. It's hard to ignore.\nI still really wish we would get some help. This way has NOT worked—ever since 2023. Every day that passes under your plan makes it worse,\nand the only thing you do is double down. It's like you want to torment me at this stage.\nI should know just to quit askingm but I feel like I have to at least try for the kid's sake.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 10:53 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks ticket sale\nI am going to ask that you not start deducting things for me unilaterally.
