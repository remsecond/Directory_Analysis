  "text": "Message 214 of 287\nI don't know how tonight happened, but if Dec 10th was the biggest night of our lives, I want to make Dec 19th just as significant. Maybe those same\nplanets aligned for us one more time.\nSo please accept my sincerest apologies for my response to this original email, which surprised me. That is not an excuse- my response was\ninappropriate and uncalled for.  As mentioned, if the original email was sent from me, it was not intentional. I hope you will forgive me for that and\nmy uncalled-for escalation. We have enough history and scar tissue to last a lifetime. I will do my best to cooperate with you and seek to de-escalate\nrather than inflame moving forward.\nSent:12/19/2024 at 08:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 11:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nOn 12/18/2024 at 11:39 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 11:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nSo you want me to follow up on the mail we sent you?\nOn 12/18/2024 at 11:38 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 11:38 AM)\nSubject:Re: Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nThe last statement is harassment and in violation of the TRO.\nYour email to me on erectile dysfunction pills violates the TRO as well.\nPlease go through Lisa and include this OFW message.\nOn 12/18/2024 at 11:16 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 11:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nI think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough\nto send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.\nAs noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were\nscreen captured. If we should revisit what you did, Iâ€™ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.\nNeither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we\nshould perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.\nOf course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.",
