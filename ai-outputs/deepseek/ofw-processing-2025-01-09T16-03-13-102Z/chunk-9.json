But I made up the difference in the split with a cash payment. So from there on it should be 50-50. I’m actually\nreally tired of this Christine when I can’t get a 30 sec phone call to coordinate for my kid and he has to lose 2 1/2 hours with me. This all seems\nnuts to me and your attention to detail across platforms is not where it needs to be.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 10:28 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 10:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nCan you check the msft Fidelity account.
