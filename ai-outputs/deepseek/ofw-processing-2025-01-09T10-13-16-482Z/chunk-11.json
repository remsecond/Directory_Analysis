Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely\ndisqualifies him for advanced placement in math.\nThis is not stuff that happens during school hours.

A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as\nwe planned! Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!\nHope you are having an awesome time!\n\nMessage 232 of 287\nHey- whatever we decide on, this is what we agreed to stop doing if there was a conversation that needed clarity. Can we please do as we agreed and\nhave a conversation to either agree or agree to disagree? I’m trying to understand the situation and don’t yet.\nSent:12/24/2024 at 12:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 01:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:31 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 01:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nSo I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts\nfor us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last\nweek.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:13 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 12:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nI’m not fighting.

Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a\nsleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.",
