Kids get sick.\nYour aggression is scary.\nSent:12/17/2024 at 10:33 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 10:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nOn 12/17/2024 at 10:30 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 10:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nI know it was not paid out. But I made up the difference in the split with a cash payment. So from there on it should be 50-50. I’m actually\nreally tired of this Christine when I can’t get a 30 sec phone call to coordinate for my kid and he has to lose 2 1/2 hours with me. This all seems\nnuts to me and your attention to detail across platforms is not where it needs to be.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 10:28 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 10:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nCan you check the msft Fidelity account.

My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what\nLisa view on this as this will impact future drops.\nThank you\nMessage 187 of 287\nThis is hostile and you are holding my money hostage.
