We will see about game tomorrow night.\nI’ll work on some calendar system for him at house.\nMessage 151 of 287\nI asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just\ncontinue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion that\nwould take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that don’t have\nthe info required to make the determination.\nYesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You refused to\nanswer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on you to check in\nand when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.\nI’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with you,\nChristine.\nIf you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help you both\nout.\nSent:12/14/2024 at 03:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nOn 12/14/2024 at 03:12 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/14/2024 at 03:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nQuestion for what?

That woman asked if everything was ok. You\nstarted talking about our sex life. If you continue to dispute that, you have not learned anything.\nJust like three years sober. That’s a lie\nThe fact I did not respond in a 15 min timeframe today was no reason to send these messages.\nNutcracker tickets were purchased prior to rescheduling to today. If you plan to weaponize changes in schedule I accommodated against me, that just\nsets the stage.\nLooking forward to getting the PC on board and hearing from Sound Practices. Did you share my contact information with them already?\nOn 12/14/2024 at 03:56 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/14/2024 at 04:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nObviously I sent him home because AD was super worried about going tonight.
