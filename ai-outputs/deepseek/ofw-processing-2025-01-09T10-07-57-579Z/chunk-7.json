By doing so you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was\nthe trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.\nI agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:58 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI am.\nOur agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.\nI’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt\nfidelity.\n\nYou will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.\nWashington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.\nThat might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:38 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 06:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI have all the stock sales (I’ll share in email).\nIt’s the cost basis that I need to figure out.\nAre you open to the payment a day later?\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:29 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 06:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI have some math I’ll share later today.\nOn 12/11/2024 at 10:06 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 06:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nSpecific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.\nToday we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the\nnext bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.\n<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>\n• Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)\n• Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)\n• The equalization payment tax treatment\n• Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis\n\nBase Income:\nChristine's Income: $226,000\nDocumented Stock Sales: $220,698.70\nEstimated Gains (70%): $154,489\nCurrent Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489\n\nTotal Income Calculation:\nCurrent Total: $606,489\nSales Needed for Me: $200,000\nEqualization Payment: $300,000\nFinal Total: $1,106,489\nTax Bracket Breakdown:\nFirst $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%\nRemaining $412,739 at 37%\nAdditional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255\n\nTotal Income Calculation:\nCurrent Total: $606,489\nAdditional Sales Needed: $200,000\nFinal Total: $806,489\nTax Bracket Breakdown:\nFirst $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%\nRemaining $112,739 at 37%\nReduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000",
