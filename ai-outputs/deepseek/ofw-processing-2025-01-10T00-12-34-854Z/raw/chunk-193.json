He may have talked to you first, but you would have also been in mediation. He can't do Sunday, he is out of\ntown.

But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.\nMy first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?\nLetâ€™s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement.
