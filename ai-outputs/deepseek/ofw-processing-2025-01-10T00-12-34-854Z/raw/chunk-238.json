I sent mine last night.\nMessage 112 of 287\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?\nThen it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.\nIf you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.\nIs that correct?\nSent:12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nIf you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .\nThat will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.\nIn mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from\nthose gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer\nbut that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was\nthe trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.\nI agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:58 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI am.\nOur agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.",
