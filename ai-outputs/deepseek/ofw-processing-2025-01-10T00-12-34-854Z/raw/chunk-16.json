I\nconfirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.\nWe will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.\nMoving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.\nThe sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.\nMonthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.\nMessage 15 of 287\nLonger discussion. But acknowledging I see this.\nLetâ€™s pay Dec 10th and let me know what my half is.\nSent:12/02/2024 at 01:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 02:31 PM)\nSubject:Re: SafeCo Car Insurance/Split\nOn 12/02/2024 at 01:11 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 01:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: SafeCo Car Insurance/Split\nSafeco called me back and I spoke to Alex.",
