  "text": "the help you have refused for over a year now.\nI don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for\nsomething different. I want “>31” instead.\nPlease stop the crazy. Let’s work together.\nMessage 196 of 287\nPlease do not say things that are untrue attributed to me. I have always acknowledged my behavior. Always, and I made a huge deal out of it at Kari’s\nin the lobby. It baffles me how you rewrite history.\nI asked where Connor said there was DV. That’s all. It’s not a challenge. I just saw him document one side of a discussion w/o saying which specific\nact was DV. I am honestly asking where he said an act was DV.\nI am looking forward to Carolyn as well, and I will agree to all her email rules. They sound like the same ones Dr Brown recommended. And I\nwelcome that. Anything that helps is work better together.\nSo are you now backing out of exploring >31? as discussed since the 9th now? I thought we had an agreement. Well I know we did, it’s here in OFW.\nI’m only requesting professional help. Is that bad?\nSent:12/17/2024 at 06:16 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 08:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nOn 12/17/2024 at 06:06 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nPlease share this communication with Sound Practices.\nGiven you have refused to acknowledge any DV and are challenging Connor’s report, this  terrifies me your state of mind and how you\ncontinue to communicate with me.\nI will wait for Caroline to onboard.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 03:41 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nJust reviewed what you demanded. That is super unfortunate. As I was trying to turn over a new leaf with you based on the \">31\" you and\nNatalie actually went for a much deeper and more draconian solution. Making it fully impossible to communicate. Unfortunate, given how\nwell OFW only has worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.\nIt's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you\njust let me, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.) You seemed like you would consider it. We talked about therapy, and you said\nyou would ask your therapist. But now I see this demand. That is what gaslighting is.\nwell that is that",
