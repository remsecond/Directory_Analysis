  "text": "feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on\nthe scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been\nused for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,\nand you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t\nreciprocated when it came to dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,\nand ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the\nIRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so\nhard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even\nhave this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?\nThen it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.\nIf you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.\nIs that correct?\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nIf you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .\nThat will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.\nIn mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from\nthose gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer\nbut that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was\nthe trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.\nI agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:58 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI am.\nOur agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.\nI’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt\nfidelity.",
