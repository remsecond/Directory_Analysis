I’m asking for\nsomething different. I want “>31” instead.\nPlease stop the crazy. Let’s work together.\nMessage 194 of 287\nJust reviewed what you demanded. That is super unfortunate. As I was trying to turn over a new leaf with you based on the \">31\" you and Natalie\nactually went for a much deeper and more draconian solution. Making it fully impossible to communicate. Unfortunate, given how well OFW only\nhas worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.\nIt's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you just let\nme, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.) You seemed like you would consider it. We talked about therapy, and you said you would ask\nyour therapist. But now I see this demand. That is what gaslighting is.\nwell that is that\nSent:12/17/2024 at 03:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nOn 12/17/2024 at 03:09 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nThen what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m\nnot doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for\nthe wrong things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.\nThe gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when\nyou said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a\nmistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.\nIf you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim\nexample. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?\nSo I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”\nOn 12/17/2024 at 02:56 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nWe have to use OFW.\nThe running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.\nSaying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context of what was happening.\nThe DV was real and confirmed.",
