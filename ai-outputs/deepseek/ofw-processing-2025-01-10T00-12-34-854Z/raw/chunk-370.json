He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How\nshould I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?\nI think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally\ndeciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.\nWere you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really\ncan’t think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 01:42 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nIs the partial answer intentional?\nYou didn’t really answer the question. Especially, if you envision a place for me in his life for academic discussions. I did get him into SAAS so\nmaybe that’s all you wanted after he got rejected. So let me know.\nI hate being shut out my kids lives, but that’s your call.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 01:18 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nOk. Confirming Adrian pick up at 3:45 at bus stop today by Alan.\nMath - Adrian and I are reviewing the materials sent by the school over break and I will provide feedback once school starts.\nOn 12/19/2024 at 01:13 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 01:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Math\nThanks. I have a very long list of things I have not seen a response on. How do we address that since this is a one way street and you refuse to\naccommodate the way we addressed every issue you had at this exact time last week? Instead, you got all your answers and then said “I’m not\ndoing that.”\nAdrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.\nAnd given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on\nthat! I see him in less than two hours. It is always this way with you.",
