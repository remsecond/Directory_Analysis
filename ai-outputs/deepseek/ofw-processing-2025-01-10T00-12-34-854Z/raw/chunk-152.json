  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 57 of 287\nThis is abusive.\nYour lawyer sent over docs so unsure what game you are playing.\nSent:12/09/2024 at 12:29 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 12:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: It has not been entered into court\nOn 12/09/2024 at 11:13 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 12:27 PM)\nSubject:It has not been entered into court\n.
