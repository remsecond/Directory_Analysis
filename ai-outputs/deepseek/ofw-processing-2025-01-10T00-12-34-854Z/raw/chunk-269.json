Let me come back on the\ncash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.\nYour cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier?

I approached you in the gym\nand asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.\nAnd per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child support, I\nsaid it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”\nI have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already. And I\noffered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.\nWhat is getting lost in translation? I have said this will happen with lawyers as the go between since last year. Why would we turn over every detail to\nhired guns?
