  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 41 of 287\nI am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I asked was\nif Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over. He will reach\nMax’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then nothing he says will\nmatter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how close you\nand Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my proposal btw)\nbut Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.\nSo just asking - did you take a vote again?\nSent:12/07/2024 at 12:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 07:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nOn 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nThe place to discuss was mediation.",
