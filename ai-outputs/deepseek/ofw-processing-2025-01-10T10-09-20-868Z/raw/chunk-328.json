One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better\nparents.\nThe presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or\nnever saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.\nBut if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids\nfuture. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.\nI do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what\nwe will do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.\nWe moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.\nMessage 169 of 287\nI made an error and the mortgage payment I submitted went towards the Condo loan.\nAre you OK if I use one month and a portion of the second month of the rental income to cover my mortgage payment?\nSent:12/16/2024 at 10:20 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:20 AM)\nSubject:Mortgage Payment\nMessage 170 of 287\nI’m not talking about the lawyers leading this. I explicitly said that. You seemed offended that I would imply that. Please see below and also reflect on\nthe things we discussed last night.\nSent:12/16/2024 at 10:20 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment\nOn 12/16/2024 at 10:18 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment\nI saw Caroline Plumber responded with some notes.",
