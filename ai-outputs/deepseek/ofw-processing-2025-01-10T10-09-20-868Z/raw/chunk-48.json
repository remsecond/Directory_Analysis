  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 42 of 287\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his communications to others, not just me.\nI was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into mediation\nso there should have been no surprise.\nBelow is blaming me again.\nI’m looking forward to speaking with Sound  Practices. I understand they were supposed to reach out to me, but I have not heard from them to date.\nIs below how they encourage you to address this issue and communications with me?\nSent:12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nOn 12/07/2024 at 12:59 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 07:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nI am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I",
