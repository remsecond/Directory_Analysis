Are you planning to update me so we can work together or is this another unilateral\ndecision?\nOn 12/18/2024 at 12:19 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 07:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Marh\nSo I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via\nthe Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.\nYou should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final\ndecision based on your authority.\nFor something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't\nexpect that formality, but I'd like to confer.\nTwo teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely\ndisqualifies him for advanced placement in math.\nThis is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind\nsharing the plan to get them on track at home?\nI want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I\ncan also help AD if he is here visting.\nLet me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.\nLet's make those Stanford trips worth something.\nthanks in advance on the partnership to be the best parents we can for these guys!\nOn 12/18/2024 at 11:38 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 11:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Marh\nSure. Your saying that his academic choices and whether to peruse advanced placement is none of my concern.",
