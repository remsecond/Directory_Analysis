And then instead\nof just working with me, you decided to go off to Leavenworth to sleep in an Airbnb with folks. That was your priority. That put me in debt\nand ruined my credit. Your selective memory is troublesome to me.\nIf you were going to create a standard for us, please apply it evenly .\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:58 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 06:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nThis is abusive Robert.\nI asked you to make the FIRST pick for months and months and you refused. I gave you access to the sheet. It is documented. With lawyers\nand OFW\nAfter you refused to make any movement I split the tickets rather than have them go to waste after you refused to do anything.\nAfter you refused to accept the tickets after you had them in your e-mail for weeks and weeks and day of said you could not use them. That is\ndocumented.\nI will try sell the tickets.\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:50 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nI never had a say in a single decision for the Seahawks. I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and\nenergy to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away\ntickets that you transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and\nexpectations are beyond astounding.\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM)\nSubject:Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nWe split 8 games and this is left over.\nIf you want them you can pay me for my half - 264\nDo you want me to list the tickets and we split the proceeds?\nJust LMK.",
