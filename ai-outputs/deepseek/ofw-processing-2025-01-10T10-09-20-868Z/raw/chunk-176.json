And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't\nhelp us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.\nThe SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the\nregular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.\nLet's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?",
