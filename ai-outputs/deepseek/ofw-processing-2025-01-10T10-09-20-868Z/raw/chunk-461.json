Is it just wait\ntill we both know they are missing AND you check OFW? Curious.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 09:01 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:AD is asleep\nDoes he know he’s coming over?\nLast Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said\nyou won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was\nkinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of\nclown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nMessage 277 of 287\nChrist\nSent:12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 04:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks ticket sale\nOn 12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 03:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks ticket sale\nThese comms are not to air grievances.\nYes if you can reimburse the costs from July for kids medical insurance.and other costs that would be great too.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 02:18 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 03:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks ticket sale\nHere is my bank count info.
