I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and\nenergy to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away\ntickets that you transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and\nexpectations are beyond astounding.\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM)\nSubject:Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nWe split 8 games and this is left over.\nIf you want them you can pay me for my half - 264\nDo you want me to list the tickets and we split the proceeds?\nJust LMK.\nMessage 168 of 287\nI saw Caroline Plumber responded with some notes.\nSent:12/16/2024 at 10:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment",
