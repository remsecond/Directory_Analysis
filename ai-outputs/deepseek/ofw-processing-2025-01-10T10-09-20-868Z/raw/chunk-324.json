Will he be there tonight? Just kicking off my usual wild goose chase to figure out what the hell is going on\nwith Adrian’s life.\nMessage 164 of 287\nWe discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better parents.\nThe presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or never\nsaying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.\nBut if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids future. As a\nbyproduct, we might be happier people too.\nI do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what we will\ndo to mend old wounds and be better parents now.\nWe moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.\nSent:12/15/2024 at 08:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 11:45 PM)\nSubject:Breakthrough Moment\nMessage 165 of 287\n\"That put me in debt and ruined my credit\" - I will give you an opportunity to correct the record.\nIf not, I will take this as another instance of gaslighting me and ask you share with Sound Practices.\nSent:12/15/2024 at 11:50 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 08:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22",
