I\nconfirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.\nWe will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.\nMoving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.\nThe sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.\nMonthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.\nMessage 17 of 287\nGreg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.\nTo approve:\nGreg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.\nKelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and wider.\nInitially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would need to fix if\ndamage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.\nMoss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by Scott\n(Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.\nSent:12/02/2024 at 02:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 03:55 PM)\nSubject:House repairs/ tree/yard\nMessage 18 of 287\nHole was in Max’s room.
