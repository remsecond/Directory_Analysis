Can we please do as we agreed and\nhave a conversation to either agree or agree to disagree? I’m trying to understand the situation and don’t yet.\nSent:12/24/2024 at 12:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 01:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:31 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 01:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nSo I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts\nfor us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last\nweek.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:13 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 12:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nI’m not fighting. The comment for new traditions is in reference to change in celebrating separately.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:07 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 12:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nUh... ok/ Were you going to tell me about the new traditions? I did ask ahead of time and gave you the opportunity to tell me a couple weeks\nback.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 12:05 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 12:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nI did regular gifts from me.\nStarting new traditions.\nOn 12/24/2024 at 09:57 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/24/2024 at 11:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: No Response Requested\nSo....\nI am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it\nup, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.\nI don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a\nsleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.",
