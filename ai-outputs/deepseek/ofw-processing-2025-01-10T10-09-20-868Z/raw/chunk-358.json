You were actually kind enough\nto send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.\nAs noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were\nscreen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.\nNeither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we\nshould perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.\nOf course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.\nOn 12/18/2024 at 07:06 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/18/2024 at 07:07 AM)\nSubject:Email will erectile dysfunction listings\nAttachments:IMG_2466.PNG (229 KB)\nWhy was this sent to me? Makes me feel uncomfortable.\nMessage 205 of 287\nSo I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via the\nOur Family Wizard (OFW) platform.\nYou should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final decision\nbased on your authority.\nFor something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't expect\nthat formality, but I'd like to confer.\nTwo teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely disqualifies him\nfor advanced placement in math.\nThis is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind sharing the\nplan to get them on track at home?\nI want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I can also\nhelp AD if he is here visting.\nLet me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge. Let's make\nthose Stanford trips worth something.\nSent:12/18/2024 at 12:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/19/2024 at 07:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian’s Marh",
