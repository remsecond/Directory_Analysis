  "text": "The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or\nnever saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.\nBut if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids\nfuture. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.\nI do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what\nwe will do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.\nWe moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.\nMessage 174 of 287\nThat sounds like a fantastic plan. I admire your willingness to work to be better parents and it the side effect is we enjoy each other's company more, I\nam willing to take that risk. I will reach out to my counselor ASAP.\nSent:12/16/2024 at 10:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:58 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment\nOn 12/16/2024 at 10:33 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:41 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment\nI am in alignment with getting me in touch with Sound Practices as a start.\nI would be interested in seeing what they recommend.\nI am also going to talk to my therapist on Wednesday about your proposal.\nOn 12/16/2024 at 10:26 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/16/2024 at 10:31 AM)\nSubject:Re: Breakthrough Moment\nOk... but please consider what we discussed. We don’t need someone else to tell us. Please let me know. We are adults too, and I am glad she\nagrees, but lets take our life back, make decisions on our own in the interests of our kids, and let them help us rather than letting anyone be the\npuppet master.\nI am only asking:\n• Get you in touch with sound practices\n• have a pro help us learn how to work together\nWhat is the worst thing that can happen? She says “hey, quit seeking professional help to be better parents?” I think at that point she actually\ntakes over and drives that engagement. That is her job imho.",
