And I do understand that’s generally the case, but in the past, at local\npharmacies, we have had both Ritalin and Adderall in 90 day supplies after the first few were filled at #30.\nI have sat in Dr Kwan’s office discussing the number of times we needed to do the 3O day Rx before we can do 90 days. So\nthis conversation is a road well traveled.\nAre we sure that is not the case here as well? Could it be because we have not had the Rx long enough, as it is new to Max?\nReally not trying to be difficult, just want to be sure we are saying the same thing.\nThanks!\nrobert\n\n=== From: Admin BCBC <apptsbcbc@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, January 26, 2024 1:29:24 PM\n\n=== To: chrisne moyer <chrisnemoyer@hotmail.com>\n\n=== Cc: rob.moyer@gmail.com <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\nHello,\nThank you for providing those details!

This is very helpful.\nAnd as I read this, we need to send the NTV by 1/11. We will likely pull the trigger prior to that just to be safe, but I just\nwant to confirm.\nbtw- we still may owe you rent this month. We are on it. We have tried autopay, but for some reason, it does not work as we\nthought.\n\n=== Subject: Fwd: Fw: Pacific Crest Real Estate Introduction\n\n=== From: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\n=== To: Christine Moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nDate Sent: Thursday, December 28, 2023 3:09:10 PM GMT-08:00\nAttachments: Move Out Sheet.pdf\nWooo Hooo.

We are, unfortunately, in a posion in which it is not appropriate for\nus to connue to rent this property in Alki as a part-me residence. Since we have never updated or re-signed a lease since the original\na few years ago, we would like to understand how we provide noce to Pacific Crest Real Estate with our intent to move out.\nThank You\nrobert & Chrisne\nOn Tue, Dec 26, 2023 at 4:53 PM Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n=== Subject: Re: Fw: Pacific Crest Real Estate Introduction\n\n=== From: Hinano Kaaialii <hinano.kaaialii@pacificcrestre.com>\n\n=== To: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\n=== Cc: Christine Moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nDate Sent: Thursday, December 28, 2023 3:00:48 PM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Thursday, December 28, 2023 3:00:53 PM GMT-08:00\nAttachments: Move Out Sheet.pdf\nGood aernoon,\nHope you had a great holiday weekend as well!
