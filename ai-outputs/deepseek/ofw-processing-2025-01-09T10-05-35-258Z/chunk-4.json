Not complaining or bothering you at all...\nGood Aernoon, Ms Bes-\nChrisne and I have made enough progress on the parenng plan that we would like to re-engage if you sll have space for\nus. I think the recommendaon is for the kids to have their own individual therapy, and our oldest (Max) will also\nparcipate with me in reunificaon therapy. Addionally, there is a litany of other therapies we will be involved with that I\nam aaching, so you have a holisc picture of our mental health acvies. Those are in the parenng plan, so we need to\ncomply with them, but we are also open to any recommendaons you have as you learn more about our children and\nsituaon.\nThis is all a new learning experience for us, and we welcome it, but the lack of a \"general contractor\" across the family's\nmental health efforts creates a challenge. I do like the suggesons you have provided below, and I would like to move\nforward with an intake session. Admiedly, Chrisne and I have struggled recently, and nerves can fray, but we will be on\nour best behavior. The reason I menon it, however, is I am not sure if 30 min will be enough vs. an hour. But I am going to\nstart trusng your good judgment on all things \"kid therapy\" from this point forward/ Please just let us know, and we will\ncooperate.\nPlease take a look below for a sample of the recommendaon from the parenng plan and how we work with you. Seems\nprey straighorward but I'd also like for you to drive the bus here and let us know how to act in the kid's best interest\nmoving forward:\nThe children's therapist should be protected from litigation by neither parent asking for their involvement in the\ncustody litigation whatsoever. Neither parent should have the \"ear\" of the therapist by having side conversations\nwith the therapist. The therapist should not have side conversations with either parent. Any communication\nshould be written and include the other parent, including communications from the therapist. Neither parent\nshould coach the children as to what they should be telling the therapist. Parents should, if possible, take turns\nbringing the children to their therapy appointments.\nbest\nChristine & robert\n\n=== From: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Saturday, December 16, 2023 12:16 PM\n\n=== To: Kari Bes <\nkari@lakesammamishtherapy.com>; Chrisne Moyer <chrisnemoyer@hotmail.com>\n\nHappy Saturday!\nThanks for the quick response. We are definitely looking forward to exploring options with you for Max, Adrian, and the\nfamily. And I appreciate the options you outlined below. That said, over the last two days, Christine and I have both spent\nconsiderable time with a therapist who is currently acting in a lightweight way as our GAL to make recommendations for a\ntemporary parenting plan that we can use till official mediation happens. During those conversations, she offered to make\nsome recommendations for how we approach therapy for Max and Adrian appropriately, considering her work. So if we\ncould circle back next week, that would be ideal. If we need the two of you to talk directly as well, we would be happy to\narrange that.\nthank you!\nrobert & Christine\nOn Thu, Dec 14, 2023 at 4:50 PM Kari Betts <\nkari@lakesammamishtherapy.com> wrote:\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\n\n=== From: Rob Moyer <\nrob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\n=== To: \"Monique (Mo) Brown\" <\ndrmoniquebrown@gmail.com>\n\n=== Cc: Christine Moyer <\nchristinemoyer@hotmail.com>, Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nBcc:\n\n=== Date: Thu, 28 Dec 2023 20:56:44 +0000\n\n=== Subject: Therapy Roundup\nHi Dr. Brown-\nChristine and I are circling back on the \"Therapy Recommendations\" so we are sure we account for all of your\nrecommendations.

I think the recommendaon is for the kids to have their own individual therapy, and our oldest (Max) will also\n\nparcipate with me in reunificaon therapy. Addionally, there is a litany of other therapies we will be involved with that I\nam aaching, so you have a holisc picture of our mental health acvies. Those are in the parenng plan, so we need to\ncomply with them, but we are also open to any recommendaons you have as you learn more about our children and\nsituaon.\nThis is all a new learning experience for us, and we welcome it, but the lack of a \"general contractor\" across the family's\nmental health efforts creates a challenge. I do like the suggesons you have provided below, and I would like to move\nforward with an intake session. Admiedly, Chrisne and I have struggled recently, and nerves can fray, but we will be on\nour best behavior. The reason I menon it, however, is I am not sure if 30 min will be enough vs. an hour. But I am going to\nstart trusng your good judgment on all things \"kid therapy\" from this point forward/ Please just let us know, and we will\ncooperate.\nPlease take a look below for a sample of the recommendaon from the parenng plan and how we work with you. Seems\nprey straighorward but I'd also like for you to drive the bus here and let us know how to act in the kid's best interest\nmoving forward:\nThe children's therapist should be protected from litigation by neither parent asking for their involvement in the\ncustody litigation whatsoever. Neither parent should have the \"ear\" of the therapist by having side conversations\nwith the therapist. The therapist should not have side conversations with either parent. Any communication\nshould be written and include the other parent, including communications from the therapist. Neither parent\nshould coach the children as to what they should be telling the therapist. Parents should, if possible, take turns\nbringing the children to their therapy appointments.\nbest\nChristine & robert\n\n=== From: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Saturday, December 16, 2023 12:16 PM\n\n=== To: Kari Bes <kari@lakesammamishtherapy.com>; Chrisne Moyer <chrisnemoyer@hotmail.com>\n\nHappy Saturday!\nThanks for the quick response. We are definitely looking forward to exploring options with you for Max, Adrian, and the\nfamily. And I appreciate the options you outlined below. That said, over the last two days, Christine and I have both spent\nconsiderable time with a therapist who is currently acting in a lightweight way as our GAL to make recommendations for a\ntemporary parenting plan that we can use till official mediation happens. During those conversations, she offered to make\nsome recommendations for how we approach therapy for Max and Adrian appropriately, considering her work. So if we\ncould circle back next week, that would be ideal.

Most\nnotably, the things Chrisne is currently doing or has done in December seem like low-hanging fruit.\n\nTelephone Access: We should ensure that parents and children can call each other regularly, regardless of which\nparent the children are staying with. For example, Chrisne has the kids at an unknown locaon in California. I\nswapped a text with Adrian. He replied it was very awkward even to swap a quick text given his situaon.\nParents/Children’s Contact Info: We should expect each parent to inform the other with their contact details. I have\nChrisne's phone number; she has the kids out of state tonight but won't provide addional informaon. That does\nnot seem reasonable. We should share addresses and contact info in case of an emergency.\nParental Behavior and Defamaon: We should specify we should not speak negavely about the other or present a\nnegave picture to our children's friend's parents. This happened recently, and Robert has been presented as unsafe\nto our children's best friends. This will indirectly impact the kids and who they can spend me with.\nFlexibility of Schedule: Given that Chrisne plays ski bus, Robert is a sports coach, and there are going to be other\nsituaons like this, it would be nice and appropriate to be able to swap days/dues if both are amenable to the\nexchange. It should not be used to take advantage of a situaon and always feel mutually beneficial.\nNo Waiver: We should clarify that being flexible with the parenng plan does not waive either parent's rights. We\nshould sck to the plan with a well-defined protocol similar to the email guidelines that define how we propose\ndeviaons from the plan. This includes proposal format, expected response me, and verificaon method.\nNo Condioning Performance: We should not permit condioning of some aspects of the parenng plan on another\naspect.\nChrisne and I should not insist on complying with one part of the plan unless another part is sasfied. We\nwant to ensure that each aspect of the parenng plan is respected and followed independently of each other.\n\n=== From: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Sunday, December 17, 2023 8:21 PM\n\n=== To: Lisa Ann Sharpe <sharpe@lasher.com>\n\n=== Cc: Vanessa G.
