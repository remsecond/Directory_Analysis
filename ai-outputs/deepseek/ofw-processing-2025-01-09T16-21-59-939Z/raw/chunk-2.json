You did that this summer as well when he\ntold two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n\nMax (16):\n• Full autonomy over relationship\n• Direct communication with both parents\n• Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n• No supervision requirements\n• No phase requirements\n• Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n• No autonomy until age 18\n• Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n• Must follow rigid phase system\n• Maximum contact permanently reduced\n• Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n• Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n• Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n• Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n• Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n• Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n\n• I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n• This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n• The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n• This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n\n• Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n• Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n• Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n• The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian\nthe free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also\ncould create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till\nadulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\n\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice.
