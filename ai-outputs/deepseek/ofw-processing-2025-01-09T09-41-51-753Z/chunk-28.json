Kari confirmed she will keep the conversation between the adults, it would be great\nif you could do the same. Based on the way you handled the holiday feedback, you confronted Adrian to investigate. I am trying to avoid a repeat\nwhere you put him in the middle of our adult situations.\nIf you would like to discuss the bigger issue with Adrain, I am all ears. I always ask, and you only say you are unwilling, but I hope we can crack the ice\nhere. This is for Adrian, not us. Based on the limited information I have from long conversations with AD, the knee-jerk mandate to have supervised\nvisits might have backfired a bit, and he is resentful.\nThat said, I am not terribly surprised. Neither of us nor our attorneys are trained in children's mental health issues, and there is an alternative agenda\nhere. Plus, there is a clear pattern of perverting the therapist's feedback into something that satisfies personal narratives by ignoring professional\nadvice. But I fear we don't have the tools to help Adrian.\nThis obviously frustrates me. Last year, I admitted what I did, asked for forgiveness, and was given the chance to work with you. We agreed to a plan. I\nput my whole life into it, and the results showed we were better than ever. We turned the corner. The Moyers were getting their long overdue reboot\nto therapeutically address past damage. Then, BOOM!\nYour watch, your plan, your results...  I liked our plan; the kids were healthy, and we were a family. We were destroying our retirement, and no one\nwas prosecuting a Sherman's March to the Sea retribution campaign. I showed contrition and was leading us down a path of recovery that is well\ndocumented. Was this really a better choice for the children?\n- Your watch\n- Your plan\n- Your results\nDid your Mom really convince you hate and revenge were the better way, and it would be healthier for our children to choose this route? Or did you\nleave out our spring and summer? Or did you feel Kevin would leave his wife when you two got hot and heavy with selfie/gift swaps, Michelin Star\ndates, nude spouse pics at dinner. KO your big secret lie.\n\nRob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nMon, Apr 29, 7:33PM (12 hours ago)\nto Kari, Christine\nSent:04/30/2024 at 08:54 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 08:59 AM)\nSubject:ADs Feedback - 4/27\n\nHi Ladies, Rather than rewriting this, I'm transparently sharing this outtake from my notes on the Saturday visit with AD. I hope we can all learn\nfrom each other and compare notes to figure out what is best for him at this difficult time. You will also see Alan's trip report attached. Draw your\nown conclusions; I am just sharing the info. PLEASE DO NOT share this with Adrian, though. I really don't want him to shut down again.\n------------- AD Visit Notes 4-27-2023 -------------\nI had a good time with Adrian on Saturday, but it was not as great as it usually is. Since the months-long separation started, Adrain has been notably\nmore distant, and his language and positions echo Christine's voice and POV. This is not at all dissimilar to what I saw in Max, which began sooner, in\nOctober of last year (when he began asking me out of nowhere when I would get a job so I would be able to pay child & spouse support. Max never\nmuch cared what our burn rate but he seems to now) Correlation is not causation, but there is a lot of correlation imho. I also shared some pretty big\nchanges in ADs behavior for Christine.    I noted a big change in his behavior since this began, so I wanted to note for you:\n- He has a very negative now, and pushes back on our \"lemonade life\"\n- Would rather \"sit around\" than do active things we always have done.\n- In general, seems distant, mutters a lot, WAY into video games now\n- Adrian cusses A LOT now. I hear \"God Damn\" | \"What the hell\" | \"SHIT\"\nBut- and this is incredibly important info and something I will share with Kari Betts, AD reached out to me late (11:30 pm) sat night to say he did not\nwant to hang out. I called him back, and we had a very long discussion. He assures me he is not scared of me, but now he is very mad at me. And\nhe can not forgive me. I listened and apologized for my poor behavior. I asked what caused this change in his attitude and he said that he just never\nhad the time to think about it, echoing his mother's vocabulary. He also has no idea of my sober history or the program I am on now that verifies my\nsobriety, which is painful since I blow for him all the time. I'm hoping for transparency about these efforts. So it was super important for us to TALK\nabout the past!\nThese discussions are critical right now. These are the same ones we all had in the spring before this started and in Jan when we started again, but we\nwere cut off and could not have meaningful conversations till Kari created a safe space again a couple of weeks ago. And while I like Alan a lot, that is\nnot a healing atmosphere for us. Adrian actually may resent the arrangement because it feels like a \"set-up.\" We can't have honest conversations about\nwhat's on our minds and important to us. Instead, we force conversation on the mundane while the painful discussions are locked away and ignored.\n\"Putting on airs\" may be salt in the wound.\nKari Betts\nMon, Apr 29, 8:12PM (12 hours ago)\nto Christine, me\nThank you for your message. I will be sure not to relay any info from the message to Adrian.\nKindly,\nMessage 2642 of 4024\nTo answer your question, yes I am using OFW.\nSent:04/30/2024 at 08:56 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 09:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW\nMessage 2643 of 4024\nNot sure how that’s possible.\nSent:04/30/2024 at 08:59 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 09:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: Did I Miss Your Call?\n\nMy Amazon account shows no registered devices .

So, let's put that on ice before we drive each other nuts on here.\nWhat I would like to do is see if you would like to continue the discussion we had on Sunday... hints of a breakthrough included:\n- I would agree to supervised visits the whole of next month\nSent:04/30/2024 at 03:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 04:42 PM)\nSubject:Temp PP\n\n- You would agree to strike all the stuff that is post-Conner\nBut we are seeing new info from AD, and I would like to consider that in case we are making things even worse. I'm talking about my info, even if you\nkeep yours a secret. But this is super important stuff to deal with sooner than later. So in the interest of our Kids, do we want to talk?\nI have not changed since last year when we began this- this is mostly my fault (booze and comms); I am accountable, I apologize again, I have a plan\napproved by you to address these issues, I really want to work with you to heal the family. It's the same 2023 commitment.\nIt was working, we all saw it. So how can we get back to that healthy place, just without you (and I going to Driftwood every week and 'other stuff') ?\nI respect you wanted to make your own decision and while unfortunate, you do you. Too little too late. But can we talk Temp PP?\nI only have one body to throw on the train tracks; I can't do any more than I signed up for already.\nThanks!\nMessage 2665 of 4024\nFYI... let me know if you need anything else on this.\nSent:04/30/2024 at 04:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Re: UA\nAttachments:IMG_0166.PNG (280 KB)\nMessage 2666 of 4024\nThe conversations feel unsafe for me.\nMy suggestion is to continue what is in the temp plan for Max, that we both agreed to.\nSent:04/30/2024 at 04:46 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 04/30/2024 at 04:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max's B-Day\nMessage 2667 of 4024\nAdhere to the parts of the plan you agree with.

You\ntold them you \"would be divorcing Dad\" when you were in Hong Kong, so I'd like to figure out how to deal with this one a little more proactively.\nSince you asked me to make reservations for him to dine with my family at Harry's last year,  was that the official start of the \"Kevin Clock\"?  Dr.\nBrown intentionally put that six-month note into our PP plan just to deal with you and him cavorting in front of Max and Adrian while we are\nmarried.\nWas that his \"trial run\"? How did the kids do in their audition? Did you guys giggle about the job opening and the poor fool who made the\narrangement for you two? He had no idea that he was training his replacement at the time. Something next level there, Christine. Next level.\nBy the way, your notes with Dr. Brown clearly discuss me and the kids in Cabo.

Your 'selective' choice of what to share and when they get a vote baffles me.\nBut thanks for moving the ball forward with open dialog. Again, I want to work with you. And I don't get why you insist on the self-destruction of\nyour plan. I was doing amazing with the kids, better than ever. Now, after months of isolation and instilling fear, they are afraid of me.\nOn a positive note, I will share that it did open up the dialog with Max. We talked, and he acknowledged all the things we were doing last Spring—\nbikes, camping, rafting, movies, camping, and anime. And it felt like he was fondly reminiscing like he wanted that again.\nLet's keep our fingers crossed. I am in no mind to battle with these stakes. And to revisit my suggestion for a while now- I think that the family needs a\ntherapeutic intervention. Kari can lead, and I will listen. But this is going to leave lasting scars we need to address ASAP.\n- robert\nMessage 2712 of 4024\nCan I get a sincere and meaningful update on the kids since the “read in” of the PP details Max noted and the adversarial legal picture you painted for\nthem?\nAdrian was whack, last night. Anytime he is with us is soul crushing to see. I already hear you saying “well, he is great with me.” Which makes my\npoint for me.\nI’ve sent endless emails asking to help AD starting in the summer. Your response of “I’ll monitor” has been devastating. He is a shell of who he used to\nbe.\nI have endless messages saying it is time for you “to put me first” and you were done with anything less. I know “I’m in charge” post it’s say it all. You\nare.\nYour watch, your plan, your results....\nSide note. I get you 1) say you are using OFW but also  2) everything goes through Annalisa. Whatever, your call. Juts fwiw- my milestones don’t\nchange.\nHappy to chat if you like. But I assume you are going to stay hell bent on destroying me and using the kids as your dynamite.  What a decision you\nmade.\nSent:05/04/2024 at 12:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 02:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\nMessage 2713 of 4024\nMax and Adrian are doing well.\nMax shared the communication with Adrian, as you requested, dad is not going to force you to do anything.\nSent:05/04/2024 at 02:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 02:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\n\nMessage 2714 of 4024\nThanks. But I’d more than a one liner given that “I’ll monitor” translated to the incident below.\nI don’t know what I don’t know with you till someone else (Max, Elsa, Kathrine, Dr Brown), spill the beans.\nPlease let me know when we can catch up today.\nShould I also assume we are done discussing PP?\nSent:05/04/2024 at 02:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 03:35 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\nMessage 2715 of 4024\nYou are not picking up. You never do.\nI need to talk about what the kids have been told. Especially with regard to your assertion that “Dad is taking you to court”.\nI know what you say Max told Adrian. But I want to known what you have told them as their parent. That is pretty important.\nAt this point you should just start being honest about the whole thing since July the 4th (not 5th) since it’s all been dishonest.\nIt is one thing for you to give up, want a divorce, abandon us. It’s another to create a whole new reality and force it on them.\nNow they have zero pics and memories even of their childhood. You have expunged me from existence. This will never be ok.\nBut at a minimum, since you have done this and secretly alienated me, I deserve to know what adult things were said to our kids.\nIt is urgent because I can’t speak with them and keep them out of it effectively without understanding your story to them. Just like Elsa.\nI don’t get the lies tbh. I did enough to be bad on my own. Why would you fabricate so much? Why would you lie to everyone?\nHoping you can find time to co-parent since you do zero during the week. I am formally asking to talk so I can speak with them.\nWhat happens on your watch is inappropriate and scary to me. I would like to discuss asap now we confirmed what you are up to.\nThanks\nBTW- if you are not going to use OFW as you dictated with your false RO, I assume I need to address this via legal avenues? Let me know!\nSent:05/04/2024 at 03:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 03:36 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids",
