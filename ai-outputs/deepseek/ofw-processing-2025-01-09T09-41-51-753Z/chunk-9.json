You guys are just so so far off wrt to understanding even the most basic things we\ncan’t have a productive discussion. It’s frustrating.\nCan you imagine trying to explain accounting to someone who doesn’t known what numbers are? To them, they are just symbols, or little squiggly\npictures on a page.

So I hope\nyou can help. To close on the phone and text messaging comments, I want to clarify the history of call/text reporting, the nature of these reports, and\nour mutual access to them as account holders. And when I was thinking about it, I realized they have likely never even seen a paper phone bill.\nI hope you will tell them that the activity described, which includes calls and texts, has long been a standard practice by phone companies that began\nin the 1980s for long-distance calls. Which were expensive. The purpose was to ensure billing accuracy and transparency to customers so they could\nmanage phone usage. This used to terrify me when I would sneak down River Oaks Parkway every night to secretly call you in Hong Kong.\nSo as account holders, we both have always had access to this information. It is our family plan after all. I even think we used to get a paper bill\nourselves. But it's not a form of surveillance by me or you. It's a standard feature by ATT for accountability, fraud detection, and accurate record-\nkeeping. And your status as an account holder inherently includes consent to reporting your data back to you as a part of the service agreement, we\nhave.\nI get without context and having never seen the fat white and blue envelopes with tens of lines of numbers inside, they don't have history. They don't\nrealize that roommates or families would grab a highlighter and take turns finding their boy or girlfriend's phone number and say which calls were\ntheirs. Then pull out the calculator to total everyone's share of the bill, just like we did with restaurant tabs when we would split up a big dinner bill.\nThey should know that our intention was never to monitor or surveil their phone usage. The logs on our bill for phone and text records is just a\nroutine aspect of our phone service. It has gone on for decades now for good reason. It started with paper fifty years ago and has since largely moved\nto an online bill where it's possible to filter, sort, pivot, and categorize history just like you can do with any online date. But it's not spying now or\nthen.\nI hope since you have their ear, and I can't teach them like I used to do, you will explain so they understand. It's just good parenting, and I trust you\nwill convey the message and ease their unfounded fears. I think we all grew up knowing that every number we dialed would show on the bill so we\nsure as hell better not spend all night on the phone with our future wife in Asia. It's just funny how we lost that history and the tribal knowledge\nsince.\nThanks!\nMessage 850 of 4024\nIs due Feb 7 in amount of 7,612 to cover Max’s ongoing school enrollment,\nWith a balance of 6.7k in BofA currently which is  insufficient funds to cover tuition in BofA plus ongoing expenses.\nThe 40k transferred was to cover my Amex card for 13k plus Chase/Amazon account for 28k.\nWhen I looked you had paid off your Amex for 9.5k (I had no visibility balance) and your lawyer bill of 3.6k  which was not factored into the 40k.

But even saying that given recent history is kicking a bees nest so let's table that. I assume we won't have that luxury. I\ncan dream.\nSo we need to make some assumptions we are not sure will come to pass and come up with a roadmap that assures he can go to SAAS and what it\ntakes to make that happen. The elephant in the room is when I can find work. That helps a lot with our planning. Even if we have no idea what our\nsplit looks like, we know more money and a dependable revenue stream always helps, no matter what. That is not a debate.\nSo, there is another bee's nest. As I am wandering around this place, up since five as usual, trying to sort my life from bags and boxes, as you and I\nnormally are manning our battle stations for the day (again maybe all my fault) I have to be realistic about trying to start an entirely new life (you were\nable to continue your sans me), attend therapy, and be ready for the next crazy, while trying to land a job at Amazon or Google. We know the toll that\ntook on me when you were fully in my corner. So that weighs on my mind as I apply for jobs. And tbh, in my mind there is just no way I can work if\nthings are like they are now (my fault or not) or even land a job.\nSo... without a fight, we need to decide if we have enough confidence in our direction and desired decision to make a Go/No Go call on the bullets\nabove. The reality is we can, we are just at a high risk of getting ourselves into a situation that we cannot sustain. My feeling is we need to have a really\nhonest discussion about what we see as our next steps. SAAS is a little microcosm of our macro picture that could be a forcing function for us. I went\nWAY OFF into the weeds but wanted you to understand my perspective. I want to work. I want to be settled. I want stability. I want to be what I was\nto our family for 25 years without the bad parts.\nBut I am not confident I can do all that in the status quo. But I can assure you my goal is to continue to provide support for my family, monetarily\nand emotionally for - you and the kids. That was my lifelong commitment, no matter what.  But it's not going to be solved in OFW. And I am not\npushing you to go off OFW. I am asking for realistic ideas for how we have a peaceful and planful discussion on SAAS right now along with an\nacknowledgment of the macro factors that I am trying to consider every day.

You were our backbone, while I was the muscle. Muscles don't work\nwithout strong bones to anchor them. We both need to be realistic about what an amazing and irreplaceable role you played in what we were able to\ndo together. So, as we discuss \"getting a job\", it is easy to say.

Perhaps even what we can look like as a mature family embracing the next chapter and reassuring him it will be even better than\nthe last. That is why we are doing this after all, and thus far it's a promise not kept.\nSo this is the 911 call AD deserves right now. He needs to see we are listening to him, and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most\nimportantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life. When he needs us, we will drop anything:  appointments,\nschedules, our problems, for him. We put our differences aside and find one voice between us, as it should be when he needs us most.\nProposing you and I do the following:\nWe try and meet AD where he is, and you even serve as gentle training wheels for us\n- I call him tomorrow and say we should all get together to discuss the SAAS option\n- I ask if I could come grab him after school Friday to help clean up for a big family meeting\n- I pick him up wearing the Homer Simpson shirt he got and a new Nike Tech replacement.\n- We go to my place and I show him the progress on all his ideas at the place he picked out\n- We decide on a to-do list of home improvements to make it shine before the SAAS summit.\nNow it's his day! He is number one and sees it in action. He has a gentle re-entry with Dad as we work on a todo list and we can talk about where he is\nat. We get things in order and prepare for Mom!!! Now this is something he never thought that could happen last Monday.\n- When you arrive, AD gives you a tour of the place that he picked out and shows off.\n- Mom let's him know how pleased and proud of him she is and that he has great ideas.\n- We make some popcorn and serve some drinks and he can play host a bit for Mom\n- Then we talk about SAAS. largely info we know already, but he has a voice to hear\n- We make some foregone conclusions, but he feels like he is driving the decisions\n- We can even play a game of ping pong to feel normal again for once since July\nAfterward, Dad can serve juicy steaks or Mom and AD head back to Kirkland. Ad knows he is first in our lives and has confidence after seeing us\ntogether that there is no more \"lost in our mess\" he feels today.\nIf we can please do this, and put our issues aside, I assure you this could be a game changer on so many levels and possibly accelerate some of the\nhealing even before we get in front of the shrinks!\nIt is so important right now that he sees Mom and Dad do what was impossible before. He will go home happy, with hope. It won't solve everything\nnor diminish the hard work ahead. But, for a night, he sees anything is possible and perhaps this new life might not be so bad after all.\nRemember, I proposed to you to get you back into the Family Photos and we spent the last 29 years together raising three wonderful kids.

I called to be sure that she knew phone numbers showed up on our bill but it exploded into how I\nruined her life. I may not agree with some of her characterizations, but that does not matter. It is her perspective. Her perception that it was me alone\ntrying to figure out what was going on in High School was surprising but understandable.\nShe told me she saw the cameras in September and thought you had put them up. I wish we had the discussion then. But it was a small point to what\nshe opened my eyes to. And it is consistent with the talk track you have played to me. That in my alcoholic years, you felt a need to acquiesce to me.\nYou were just trying to keep the peace and not rock the boat. I needed to hear that.\nI understood then as she snuck boys into her room, sent underage porn on her phone, vomited vodka over both sides of the truck (she had been\ndriving), lost a six-figure full ride to college shoplifting for a boy, and made LBGTQ offensive online posts, what we were doing to get her back on the\nrails was mutually agree to. we both were trying to sus things out together.\nBut her perspective is that it was all me and has always been all me. And now this incident is just a continuation of that behavior. It is important to me\nthat I know now that I am seen as the villain in this family. That we were not the team I thought we were. And at least in her mind (and maybe yours)\nI was doing all these things to be nefarious and ruin her life. I need to think on that.\nBut most important is the insight into where I think you are coming from. I thought as we were raising our kids we were aligned. But you are washing\nyour hands clean of that. That this was all me and you had nothing to do with it. It is a history that does not match mine. But I was an active alcoholic\nso maybe I was missing things that you were telling me or misinterpreting things.\nEither way, it was a deep and insightful lens into the narrative you and the kids have. And at this point in my life, it helps explain a lot. I believe\nmarriage takes two, but if the perspective is it was all me as some despotic ruler, I want to acknowledge that and do some soul-searching on how this\ncame to pass. How I thought we were making parenting decisions together but were not.\nIt has been said that \"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”\nMaybe I'm that asshole...\nSent:02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 09:17 AM)\nSubject:Elsa\n\nMessage 898 of 4024\nHope an update on finances qualifies as child related.

Y is\ngoing to share her perspective on what happened\nSent:02/01/2024 at 12:15 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\n\nMessage 916 of 4024\nI don’t see that.\nI see that she talks to AD and possibly us?\nIs that what you mean?\nSent:02/01/2024 at 12:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 917 of 4024\nI hate OFW formatting...\nWithout the running list discussion, our list is piling up quickly and will only get worse. We can do it this way and still live, but it's not going to be\ngood for us or the kids, and probably bankrupt us in the end.\nThen there is also the reality of situations that arrive on the fly like Elsa this AM. At this point, the fact that she blames me for her entire childhood\nand you were just a bystander may be a deal breaker for her and I. Historically we spoke with one voice. Hell, I think July 5th came to a head because I\nwas defending you. But it's a big deal that may mean we don't talk again for years. We are quite literally crashing and burning.\nI almost feel like we need a general contractor to host a summit for us. But at a minimum, we need to figure out what we are trying to do here and\nhow to communicate more sustainably. This is more harm than good.\nHere is what I have for today. I hope we just try to touch on issues with a quick Ack and next steps. Then wait for Anna Lisa to tell us when we can\nchat about the mental health, safety, and well-being of our kids.\nRunning List- You're speaking w/ Anna Lisa, thank you! What's the plan, She's not responsive tbh.\nAdrian- Our most important item yesterday. You won't consider my plan. Can we have a fallback?SAAS- Still stuck in neutral here. We need to have a\nbigger discussion on financial commitment.\nLugg- Are we aligned on day/time/payload? Who is going to set it up? Did I tip them? Use Devon?Dr Brown- Can we fix email? What's scope and\noutcome desired? Is she expected to adjudicate?\nXfinity, ATT, Bofa- I get alerts still, you are the 2x auth on ATT, you get all my stuff for BoFa now\nSoberLink- I finally located and put an airtag on it. I also peed and sent that in. Are we good?\nTruce- We agreed to try but it feels like you are not in a place to really try this now. Thoughts?\nRO- what was the intent and desired outcome? I signed it but nothing appears to have changed.\n--------------------------Cut line?-------------------------------\nElsa- Big bucket. no apology to you? our swinging? no shared responsibility, all me that did this?\nCommunication- We agreed to see someone, we did not. Now we can't talk. Can we address?\nOne Voice- You said kids don't know. Appears you have talked in great detail to them. What's up?Transfers- We are covered right now (agree) but we\nneed the running list discussion to sync.\nEmails- you do them occasionally. Should I do that too? Are we allowed to CC each other\nBills- what bills are you no longer paying? What should I be picking up that I am unaware of ?\nBoys Blink- I shared an apology. You take issue with the explanation. But can you share \"sorry\"\nSent:02/01/2024 at 12:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/01/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication",
