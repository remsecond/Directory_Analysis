In my heart, I don't believe you \"spy\" on\nme any more than I spy on you. What good is that to either of us? It's just dumb and really provides no \"strategic advantage\" to anything we are trying\nto accomplish as co-parents.>>\nQuick Recap:\n- On 10.21, after getting you a phone, I sent you an email (see attached) that said: \"Christ... we are so intertwined. We will be sorting this out for\n\n- You started saying I bugged your phone because of how quickly I replied to you on OFW. This was actually my watch vibrating when you sent me\nsomething.\n- You started saying I was tracking your car because somehow I was catching you lying. You misrepresent the truth so often (Boxing Day), your \"tells\"\nare obvious.\n- You maintained the ability to track my car and where I was coming and going in real time. You have assured me you deleted the app and don't use it\nanymore.\n- Then we had the cam incident that gave you another reason to say I was spying on you. I apologize for not being more forthcoming and explaining\nthis in detail.\n- You were super pissed I asked for a mutual \"no digital surveillance\" agreement. Your response was you would initiate career-ending litigation if I\nasked for this.\n- You changed the Kirkland Xfinity plan to eliminate my access. As the network admin, you send me daily alerts and below you somehow say \"stop\ntracking me\".\n- I began noting the situation mentioned above to you along with screen captures. I explained the tech and told you how we can stop it but you have\nmade no effort.\n- You said I was tracking you since we have a Microsoft family plan. The data on the shared plan has never changed, and you know this because you\npaid that bill.\n- After hearing about the cam situation in painstaking detail and a series of meetings, Dr. Brown said we both have good points; it's time to move\nahead w/o retribution.\nAt present, in addition to the things mentioned above, you can still control the sleep number of my bed and I can control the temperature of the\nKirkland house (which you ask me to help with.) After telling you we have a bunch of things that a smart, digitally connected, and cost-conscious\nfamily would implement to keep the kids safe, discourage intruders, and save money, here we are. My apology for not \"re-notifying\" you of offline\ncams used for visual deterrence resulted in not being able to see my kids and likely irreparable parental alienation. My request for you to share \"mutual\ndigital monitoring protocols\" resulted in threats against my livelihood, promised legal retribution, and a false restraining order that says I am a\n\"credible threat to do you and my kids physical harm\" stands to this day. Despite confirming that the RO was both a mistake to file and false, you\nrefuse to remedy the situation.\nYou always criticize me when I spend the time and effort to explain things to you in detail and recount our history. You say it is too much for you to\nunderstand and it makes you mad that you have to spend time reading it and have to come back later. So yes, it did take 30 minutes to write this all\ndown. But I think it is important to separate fact from fiction, and given the toll it has taken, if you have made it this far,  it might also be worth you\ntaking ten minutes to read and contemplate we really don't have to keep going down this road. I genuinely want what's best for our kids, and\nhonestly, I want what's best for you – for the sake of our safety and peace of mind. If you're open to looking at things differently, I'm more than ready\nto work together in a positive way.\n- robert\n\nMessage 2175 of 4024\nI apologize for the start of the conversation. I acknowledge I began expressing my sincere concerns. I've been your soulmate for 28 of our 29 years\ntogether, which is a hard habit to break when I see you this way.\nI did want to connect to discuss the Robotics situation for reasons I mentioned below and did not want to eat up our limited OFW minutes. I agree.\nThat clearly triggered you, and you hung up and refused to reengage.\nI also agree that you told me \"your plans for the activity I signed up for\". Reminiscent of signing up to be our kids' father and telling me your plans to\naccommodate that role in their lives. I don't get a say in anything.\nWhen you started this, our kids were great with me. I have evidence and history of that, and you have admitted as such. You cherry-pick advice you\nwant to leverage like it's canon law and ignore anything else.\nYou know no reunification therapist will touch us because there is no accountability for you, and you still don't let me see the kids 8 months into this.\nYou also caused months to pass before even Kerri Betts could engage.\nSo, while you have chosen to supplant me as the Robotics volunteer and father figure, I had additional questions I wanted to ask so I could play some\nsmall part in their lives. But you would not permit that conversation.\nI knew this was going to be the case because you are as predictable as the tides, so I called several times to find a way to be in Max's life. You did not\nrespond till well after the event (over 21 hours) eliminating that.\nYou found and implemented your own justification for parental alienation as you do daily.\nSent:03/16/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/16/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Urgent - Something is wrong with you\nMessage 2176 of 4024\nSend whatever devices you think I am dropping in on you back.
