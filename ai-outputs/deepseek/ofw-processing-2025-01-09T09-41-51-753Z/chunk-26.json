I am super bummed that I have to send this to you instead of discussing it because after agreeing to talk about the situation with me again, you\nrefuse to. You said his spiral into self-destruction is entirely my fault. And I am the sole reason Adrian is having problems. I asked that we peacefully\nand constructively discuss things we could consider as his parents.\nBut again, you have insisted on unilateral control as the single Omnipotent ruler of the Moyer family. I have sent similar proposals to this for months,\nstarting in September. I can re-send if you like. I have asked repeatedly to have you consider a healthier path forward that allows the kids to develop\ntheir own opinions and be able to love us both.\nYou always say no. Your way is the only way. Period. And here we are. You won't consider what I wanted to share below. That seems nuts to me. So,\nas you eliminated every memory from our house so there is no trace of their documented childhood, you also insist on your history only. I also\nwonder if you will rewrite who you brought to breakfast with them at Harry's as well...?\n-------------------------------- The Thoughts on Adrian I Wanted to Share --------------------------------\nChristine-\nI realize there is hurt on both sides, but our priority in our conversation should be finding common ground to benefit Adrian's mental and emotional\nwell-being. I want to stop scoreboarding and focus on establishing a unified front for Adrian’s sake. should reflect on how our actions and conflicts\nare affecting Adrian. He's not just an observer; he's in the heart of this, and it's taking a toll on him. He has said repeatedly that he feels like he is in the\nmiddle, which is an accurate statement.\nAnd gifted children like Adrian can be more susceptible to our parental tension, leading to serious issues, like the self-harm he's already expressing.\nInstead of focusing on our disputes, let’s concentrate on reinforcing positive parenting. Each of us should build him up, provide stability, and show\nhim unconditional love. Let's find a way to co-parent cooperatively, even if we need a mediator or a counselor to assist us. We don't have to be friends,\nbut we do need to be partners in parenting. We owe that to him right now.\n- Establishing a Unified Front\nEmpathy and Acknowledgement- We’ve been through a lot, and our emotions have run high. It’s tough on both of us, and I see in real-time how it’s\naffecting Adrian, given his unique emotional needs as a gifted child. We saw it again yesterday at Kari's.\nThe Impact of Conflict- Our conflict has been brutal on Adrian. He’s shown signs of emotional distress, and I know you’ve noticed changes in him as\nwell. As his parents, we both want what’s best for him; he needs us to work together right now.\nThe Need for Consistency and Truth- Gifted children like Adrian need a consistent and stable environment. They're more affected by discrepancies\nand uncertainties. Conflicting stories or hidden truths will cause him more significant anxiety and confusion.\nChild's Right to Love Both Parents- We both love Adrian, and he has the right to love both of us without feeling guilty or torn. When we use him as a\npawn, we're infringing on this right and putting our needs above his. Let's please stop that.\nSent:04/16/2024 at 04:20 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/16/2024 at 04:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can we debrief?\n\n- Parental Alienation and Its Impacts\nOur Role as Parents- Adrian needs to see despite our differences, we both prioritize his well-being. Using him as a messenger or expecting him to take\nsides places an unfair emotional burden on him. We need to protect him from our adult conflicts.\nAdrian’s Well-being- We’ve both been his pillars in his 12 short years and must continue to be regardless of our acrimony. It hurts me deeply to see\nhim struggle like this. Parental alienation can be incredibly damaging, and it's taking a toll on him.\nRebuilding Trust- I want to rebuild trust with Adrian, not just for my sake but also for his mental and emotional health. As his father, we both have\nto assure him that he is safe with me and doesn’t need to choose you over me or take your side.\nAlienation for Gifted Children- Kari, who understands his advanced emotional and intellectual capacities, has expressed concern about our current\ndynamic. Adrian's heightened sensitivity can magnify the emotional pain of feeling torn between us.\n- Positive Memories and Their Role in Adrian’s Stability\nOur Positive History- Adrian's memories of us as a family and our past experiences are his identity. Today he looks around and doesn't see any\nrepresentation of memories. You took those from him and he may feel like he's lost part of himself.\nBoth of Us are Adrian’s Life- Even though we’re separating, for Adrian’s psychological well-being, he needs to know we both love him and that he\nhasn’t lost the love of either of us. He needs a sense of continuity and security to feel safe again.\nUnified Communication- Let’s decide on how we’ll communicate with Adrian about the divorce and any changes in our household. It's 9 months\noverdue so it's crucial we do it calmly and without casting blame to avoid causing him further distress.\nCoping Mechanisms—We should consider strategies to help Adrian cope with the changes. Perhaps we can work with Kari to develop a consistent\nnarrative that helps him understand the situation in an honest but also reassuring way togehter.\n- Setting a Path Forward\nLong-Term Consequences- The long-term psychological effects of being in the middle can be profound for a child as perceptive as Adrian. If we\ncontinue this way, he might struggle with trust, relationship-building, and self-worth in the future.\nImmediate Actions- Until Conner is done, we should work on creating a peaceful environment around Adrian. This means resolving not to fight in\nfront of him and to ensure he feels supported by both of us during his time with either parent.\nLong-term Considerations- We need to find a way to co-parent effectively. This is not just about us but about ensuring Adrian’s giftedness is not\novershadowed by familial turmoil. He deserves to have a fulfilling childhood and reach his potential.\nCollaboration with Professionals—I want us to take the advice of the professionals seriously, not cherry-pick. They have Adrian’s best interests at\nheart. Let’s collaborate and utilize their expertise to support Adrian through this crazy mess he is in.\nLet's both remember the positive role each of us has played in Adrian's life and figure out how we can continue contributing to his development and\nhappiness by creating a stable and nurturing environment for Adrian moving forward. Thanks in advance for your partnership and thoughtful\nconsideration...\n-robert\n\nMessage 2508 of 4024\nWriting something does not make it true.\nYou can send something like this, but actions are what matter.\nAfter stating how we should communicate and no snarky comments etc, see three OFW unrelated to this sent earlier during my work day and snarky\ncomments included below.\nSent:04/16/2024 at 04:55 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 04/16/2024 at 04:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Can we debrief?\nMessage 2509 of 4024\nThe other messages were not related to this.

What makes it true is the digital paper trail of my attempts to work with you to help our kids and then\nyour documented refusals to do so.\nYou can pretend you entertained my perspective, just like you pretended to trust Dr Brown or even Kari now. The actual chronology will show\nsomething different. It's all documented.\n- June 30th: The best the Moyers ever were as a Family Together\n- July 4th: You hid the affair with Kevin by moving off Sbux servers\n- July 5th: You asked for a peaceful separation and nesting for us\n- July 23rd: You lied about you and Kevin but I showed you proof\n- April 16th: Max won't even talk to me, AD is thinking of Self Harm\n- April 17th: You're refusing to engage on my thoughts for AD\nI can add more details, but instead, I would like to discuss what I have proposed.

But I'll also attach last week's to see if anything\nresonates with you. This is hard...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ My Plan Subject to Kari's Advice\nBuilding a solid foundation for mending and strengthening my relationship with Adrian is essential. I will stay healthy and move forward one step at a\ntime. I will maintain my sobriety and be transparent with him when he has questions. This includes safe words, Soberlink, or anything else that gives\nhim peace of mind. This will take time, but it's the long game I'm playing.\nAfter my discussion with Kari, talking with my sponsor, and doing my research, my proposed focus will be:\n•     Apologize. I'm sorry today, but I will keep apologizing for what I have done. I want Adrian to know I mean it and hear what he says.\n•     I need to be open and transparent about my recovery so Adrian understands how serious I am about staying sober so that I will be there for\nhim.\n•     When he opens up, I will listen first. I want him to express himself fully before I respond to show him that he is valued and his voice matters to\nme.\n•     Given that actions speak louder than words and consistency is essential, I will continue to show up, stay sober, and keep a regular routine.\n•     I will work with Kari to set clear goals for my time with Adrian. It can be either about doing activities or just heartfelt chats. But we need the\ntime.\nSent:04/20/2024 at 08:40 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/21/2024 at 05:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian... two weeks in a row\nAttachments:Recommendations_for_Gifted_Children-_AD.pdf (891 KB)\n\n•     Adrian needs to have a say in what we do when we spend time together so he feels respected and in charge. I want him to feel his sense of\ncontrol.\n•     We've bonded through sports, but I would also like to continue to bond with him intellectually, so I'll suggest activities that challenge him\nmentally.\n•     I want to demonstrate my agape love for him so he sees that it is unconditional and not dependent on anything Adrain does, says, or achieves.\n•     My therapy will be essential to ensure I am strong mentally and physically so I can focus on Adrian rather than what has transpired with us\nsince July.\n•     It will take my time. Rebuilding trust requires that, but I also need the opportunity to do it so we can celebrate small victories and stay the\ncourse.\nNaturally, I am all ears if you have any input on this plan for me. That is, after all, why I want to discuss it with you. Having two parents working\ntogether in his best interest is far more beneficial than us operating without communication, checkpoints, goals, or shared strategies for his mental\nhealth. So, please reconsider the position you've taken since Hong Kong.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  My Suggestion to You as a Co-parent\nIf you really want to help Adrian navigate through everything we have him messed up with, here are my suggested steps that you could take to make\nthings better genuinely:\n•     We need co-parenting therapy. We have to stop making excuses and figure out how to work together for Adrian's sake. This is about him.\n•     I hope you'll show empathy and take a moment to understand how much this affects him and act. He feels like he is then in the middle now.\n•     I'd like you to encourage Adrian to share his feelings for both of us neutrally so that he doesn't feel like he has to take sides to please one of us.\n•     The internet and attorneys are your best resources, said no professional child therapist ever. Please consider taking the advice of professionals.\n•     I need you to start supporting his relationship with me. Cutting off contact and requiring supervised visits further villainizes me and fosters\ndistrust.\n•     I want to stop the blame game. He sees this, and it's not healthy. We need to quit being hospital to one another when he is around. That is\ndevastating.\n•     SAAS was a big decision we made together. Let's find other opportunities to show him that we will put him first and make decisions in his\nbest interest.\n•     I would encourage you to do more reading. I appreciate your focus on self-care, but understanding the impact of divorce might help you\nbetter support him.\n•     You might consider what we are teaching him about forgiveness. This is an important lesson in Adrian's life, teaching him how to handle hard\nsituations.\n•     I support your therapy, so you are there and healthy for him, and also after some healthy introspection on the messages we send, admitting\nmistakes.\nFocusing on these steps could make a massive difference in Adrian's life. He needs both of his parents to be at their best and work together, especially\nnow. It's up to you to consider or not.\nI'll continue to do this whether you get on board or not. But it's important to me to continue to try and get you involved for Adrian's sake.\n-robert\n\nMessage 2537 of 4024\nHey -\nPer our in-person chat this evening, I just wanted to confirm we agreed to peaceful, constructive, non-violent communication on OFW till our\ncomfort permits more.
