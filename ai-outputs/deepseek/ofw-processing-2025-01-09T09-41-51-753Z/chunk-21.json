I ask not to do them and communicate that. I try to wrap the\nconversation or discussion as quickly as possible. Once in calmer environment, without your influence, I am able to think clearly.\nIf there are situations that require limitations, as in our case, it is not 50/50. That is why we are negotiating this PP.\nBringing up Kevin is disappointing. I have avoided responding and addressing when you have brought up on numerous occasions in the past, but will\naddress for one last time.\nReference to Kevin is harassment and disturbance of the peace in violation of the RO. RO states communications are limited to co parenting or\nshared assets.\nGiven the space of 8 months to reflect on what happened, I disagree with the characterization of an affair. That is not a fact. You made me agree to\nsomething after months of yelling and your view of what happened. I did not disclose the picture to you when asked, but that does mean it was an\naffair. I would characterize it as a friendly interaction.\nI don’t consider that issue as something that relates to our co parenting or shared assets. And will not engage in that discussion any further. If you\nchoose to do so, you know my perspective on that topic and intersection with RO.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 12:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 12:12 PM)\nSubject:Re: Business solver\n\nMessage 2057 of 4024\nLet’s make some time today/tonight to discuss your thoughts.

I put the note below in the invite so I hope you agree.\nOne thing I will note that I am not sure resonates with you is that every single mental health professional we have ever seen, and Dr. Brown was the\nmost forceful and direct, said the attorneys are not trying to help us. They stir the pot and make money even if it destroys our children's lives. You\nkeep saying you want professional guidance but insist on doing the opposite with the most critical piece—the attorneys who keep making things\n\nIf you share ahead of time, as I offered to do with you on every occasion, I can see changes, and we walk through them more effectively. I'll have her\nguidance to compare it with prior to the call. I assume we both track changes, so we are transparent and just do it.\nWe should aim to be as close to Dr Brown's guidance as possible and both be prepared, as she likes to say, to be \"equally unhappy. \" And if we don't\nagree, it would be much more cost-effective and beneficial to our mental health to ask to schedule time with her.\nWhich was why I called the last meeting. Because I did not want us to have TWO versions of her and  then pay tons of money to have our lawyers\nfight it out. It was specifically to avoid us having an impasse before we even got started. Let's please consider that.\nSent:03/10/2024 at 03:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/10/2024 at 04:43 PM)\nSubject:Parenting Plan\nMessage 2083 of 4024\nI will discuss changes with but not language as I may tweak it.\nWe opted not to go with a full Parent Evaluation. Dr Brown did not speak to Adrian about the history and you insisted it be limited to that one event.\nShe has never had the full story. A full parent evaluation is still in my mind an option, if I don’t believe full accountability and recognition of your\nactions and impact are considered and reflected in how we structure the plan.\nI am growing increasingly concerned by your accusatory tone, bringing up delays as my fault, and a minimization of impact of your 25 history on the\nfamily. In one breathe you will say it, then point to a recent 4 month window out of 25 years that things may have been stable and you you showed up\nin a way a father is normally expected to. In that window, what you fail to mention is regression to unsafe behavior, emotional dis regulation, relapse\nfrom sobriety, and recent unlawful surveillance activity. It is with that lens I structure the plan for best interest of children in mind.\nThis is aside from continued insistence that you and I develop a friendly relationship, that I have been advised by mental health professionals, is not\nappropriate at this time given the history of DV and coercion and control. That request must stop.\nIt is in my right to change my mind after i experience various factors, which includes continuation of behaviour that I feel are unsafe\nYou may feel anger at this. I can’t control that. What you are not in your right to do is lash out at me.

Please fill her in on the details she needs if you think that helps.\nNote that with the parenting evaluation, we will need to 1) cancel our July mediation.

But based on prior history, that typically is the case. I think we can agree there.\nI am not requesting you file charges. I can’t make that clearer. I have never claimed \"a RO\" was frivolous. We suggested an RO that prevented digital\nsurveillance. You came back with an RO that cut off all constructive communication methods and channels. That may have been over the top.\nYou focused instead on allowing no emails, phone calls, or texts even for emergencies. It was for child-related issues only; with no allowance initially\nfor anything else. You also added I was a \"credible threat\" to physically beat you guys out of the blue. That is not at all about monitoring.\nSo there should be no contention in mediation. You raised monitoring as an issue. We tried to solve the issue you raised. You chose to add things to it,\nusing the RO as a vehicle for other issues. I think we both can see and agree that I don't beat my kids now or ever, but it was filed.\nI expect you to go over the PP with Annalisa and know things will get MUCH WORSE. It happens every time. So, we are at the impasse we tried to\navoid. The only remedy is using Dr Brown, who we chose for that reason. Otherwise, we could have been at this same impasse in October.\nIf you want to discuss I am open to it. But I have said \"what I am saying\" so please don't tell me I'm saying something else.

Running List: Friday 3/8\nMessage 2122 of 4024\nYou said that that the work was being done by Greg, then JV. If you really arranged neither, I don’t expect you to put yourself in danger for the two\non the back porch. I did, however, say that if you took a picture and then brought me the sub in the mailbox Sonos, that would be very helpful.\nI have repeatedly said do not send anymore things to my place that are in the garage or the IT closet I can find mails for you. Until we settle the house,\nit is not yours. So don’t continue to trash my place by sending things here when we have storage in a garage I don’t have. Please stop the threats.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 08:52 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.

Are Sonos your property. What are you defining as your property.\nGreg I had to reschedule. JV was here but I need to see if he pulled them down.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 10:05 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 10:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.

It is the only thing I’ve asked for months now.\nIf after a week you still have not checked that JV did the work, I’m not sure how you say you have to climb a ladder and put yourself in danger.\nIMHO, you are now intentionally stoking fires to create conflict with me so I will respond negatively. This is your MO, but I am not biting.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 10:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:02 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv. Running List: Friday 3/8\n\nMessage 2128 of 4024\nWhen we pay for Adrian it will require from bank account that has cash and not a credit card.\nWe will have tuition, study skills and bus.\nI saw the fidelity account has about 15k, so I could link it to that account.\nBofA only has 4k, which we will need for expenses. Mortgage will also be due soon. My next paycheck is end of week.\nI’ll look at credit card totals this week to see what is outstanding.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:06 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:06 AM)\nSubject:SAAS tuition/Bills\nMessage 2129 of 4024\nSuper! Thanks for the fast attention on this\nFor SAAS, can’t we do the same as for Max?\nWhat’s our BofA number?

I am uncertain why he did not as he had the ladder up.\nI did ask him to check the dripping from deck which he caulked, but likely forgot.\nI’ll pull the ladder up perhaps on Saturday after robotics.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:10 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:10 AM)\nSubject:Re: Abv.

If you need those numbers again I can send them.\nI have not seen tuition bills yet and will ask today. I’m asking in anticipation.\nSent:03/12/2024 at 11:14 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/12/2024 at 11:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS tuition/Bills",
