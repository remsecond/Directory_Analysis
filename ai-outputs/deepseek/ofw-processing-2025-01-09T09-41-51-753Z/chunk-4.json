In ourselves for\nwaiting so long, and each other as we try to find blame for a lost dream shared.

I'd\nlike to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in your sitting room.Furniture: I will move our sitting\nroom and guest room stuff to new place.I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may\nprefer that from a measurement perspective. OK for guest room I am using beach stuff so we don;t need to buy anything.

I'd like to finish that part of the move.Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.You\ncan take all the grills. I will not use them. Does this include the green egg? If not, I can arrange for the dump. Sounds good. We can move those over.\nNote there is a smoker that is under the hot tub mailbox as well.  Misc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?\nCan take bean bag from man cave, Pelloton, Stair Master, desk all from Man Cave. I have nice Crate and Barrel art pieces that are not hanging up that\nyou can take a look at and decide. You can also take the Moose in living room, cows head on porch. From this list I would say we move any pieces that\nyou feel like sharing, the cow's head, I can take the bean bag if you want me to but I want a black cover so may need to order? Let's sell the Peleton. I\nassume Max will need the stairmaster.  Kitchen: Realistic division of shared assets, I think you are working on that.Do you want the Crate and Barrel\nyellow plateware set? I pulled out the SBUX set that I bought 10 plus years ago, and have started to use that. LMK if you want the whiteporcelain set\nthat was on wedding registry. Its barely used. and the plateware Christmas set from your mom. Just LMK. Let's wait for medition to start divying up\nmore of the plateware. I am fine for now.  Decorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.OK Love to still do this.\nMy place is bleak. I could really use your help as we discussed. Linens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?\nBoth households could use a refresh. Let's do this.

Adrian and I have been texting all weekend and you are correct in that I did not understand the\nsituation as well as I would like to. That goes for both tonight and since this all began. Admittedly I did not grasp the gravity of the situation initially\nand should have treated it with the import and urgency it deserved. In my mind, I had my interpretation of what happened and did not give enough\ncredit to the merit of your interpretation. That was a mistake that I apologize for. I should have been more thoughtful of your perspective. I am sorry.\nWe had a pretty explosive discussion on this topic today. We talked about the back-and-forth between the lawyers and your dissatisfaction with the\ncurrent situation. You told me what your plan of action was and then said that I needed to make it right immediately if I wanted to avoid that\noutcome. I want to be clear that I heard you and have taken action to that end immediately. But there is more to it than that. You feel like your trust\nhas been violated. You feel like that still might be the case. You are not confident in your safety and want to feel comfortable in your own space.\nThat, I agree, is an inalienable right. One that you should not have to ask for. You are entitled to that and I would like to do any and everything in my\npower to assure you have that, not only for yourself but for the children we share. You are all still my family and I would give my dying breath in your\nprotection and I would like the opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Put you at ease. Give you 100% confidence that things you know have happened\nhave an explanation and are not dismissed as crazy musings. No crazymaking, just an honest discussion of the facts comparing our notes.\nWe are clearly in a tenuous legal situation. One that limits our opportunities to speak freely. But... since this all went down, and the gravity of the\nsituation has become clear, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the situation and possible outcomes, peaceful and otherwise.\nAnd because we can't realistically do this in email, I'd like to propose a \"take II\" of our conversation earlier today. I'd like to hear your asks, and present\nthe thoughts I have to see if they might perhaps alleviate your concerns and lay the foundation for an honest path forward peacefully and respectfully.\nIf I may, please note I took time and sat on your email. I am trying to demonstrate the seriousness and respect for the situation I have. And I am scared\nto death to even send this, but I have to try and answer your questions and give you what you need and deserve. If you need time also, please take it.\nBut please consider what I am proposing as well. It may make all the difference in our future.\nSent:01/14/2024 at 10:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 07:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian game  tonight\nMessage 403 of 4024\nI have one xl van Lugg booked for Friday AM\nThe plan is for me to look into getting a big truck as the week progresses and if I can, I will book that and cancel this.\nThe only other question is, if that is not possible, I can book another xl van for noon.

I tried.\nMessage 428 of 4024\nFor the record, you have categorically stated you did not surveil me in any form.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Disclosures\nMessage 429 of 4024\nStop it!!! Saying the same thing over and over does not make it true. You said you were going through your lawyer and you have not given me a single\nchance to respond. You only just told me today. How the hell am I supposed to respond??? Please let me help! I really am trying but you won’t let me.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Re: Disclosures\nMessage 430 of 4024\nI know what I said below. And I have explained that I can speak to this issue. You won’t allow me to.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 05:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 05:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Disclosures\nMessage 431 of 4024\nI’m getting pinged tonight for a 1st round Thursday and I have a 2nd round on Wednesday. I have your ask from this afternoon of course, but I’m\nstill in the dark on what it means. I know you mentioned some sliding scale that I am totally unaware of but it sounds like you are going DV no matter\nwhat I say. If you can confirm I’ll cancel with some dignity. If/when this gets worked out in the future, they are both with companies that I really\ndon’t want to be blackballed from. I’m not blaming you, I’m just trying to gracefully adjust to the situation without burning all my bridges.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 07:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 08:15 PM)\nSubject:Recruiter\nMessage 432 of 4024\nYour lawyer was trying to mitigate for you to I think try avoid what you describe below. We made our ask and you are refusing and unwilling to\nprovide this information despite what you say can be explained easily.\nIf you prefer to easily explain this away in front of the court/judge after we file our order, when you could do so on the front end easily, as you say,\nthat’s an interesting strategy but one it appears you have thought through with your lawyer.\nSent:01/15/2024 at 08:25 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/15/2024 at 08:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: Recruiter",
