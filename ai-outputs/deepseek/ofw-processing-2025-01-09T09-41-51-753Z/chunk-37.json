I do not want to escalate in anyway. But given that Max has come here in an ambulance with a heart arrhythmia and is\nunder evaluation for cardiac problem I actually need to know what’s going on with my son.\nI understand you got angry with a touch of the arm and said you would write to Connor to tell him I touched your elbow. I am OK with that. I did\ntouch your elbow lightly and said I am sorry but what I need to know is is Max OK?\nPlease save your escalations for after this. I told you we have a history of this condition in my family. That is important information. Please be the\nadult and tell Max he needs to let us parent and communicate about his emergency condition.\nSent:08/15/2024 at 10:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Please Contact Me\nMessage 3719 of 4024\nYou sent the doctor to the lobby after I left. And you knew that. Then blamed me. Now you cut off all communication again. This should be about\nMax. You just turn it on and off to attack me and threaten me, then turn it off. Please stop that. Please work with me on Max. I did not get to speak\nwith you or the Doctor now. I have no idea what you are doing! Please help.\nSent:08/15/2024 at 10:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Please Contact Me\n\nMessage 3720 of 4024\nThey jumped him. The heart  rhythm is normal now. They will monitor for. An hour and send us home. There will be a follow up but hoping this is\na one and done.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 12:28 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 12:28 AM)\nSubject:Max\nMessage 3721 of 4024\nThanks for the update. It’s great news to hear. I’d like to stay updated but I assume this means you blocked me where we were communicating all\nnight.\nSo now I need to move here to track emails rather than actually communicate and ask questions. That is super unfortunate. But I am at your mercy.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 12:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3722 of 4024\nWhen can I ask questions for the doctor since you are our only mouthpiece and have gone from email, to text, to call, to text, to OFW in the space of a\nfew hours. It’s really hard to chase you down and communicate in a timely way when I’m playing Where’s Waldo about my son’s heart condition.\nPlease ask:\n- What might have caused this AFib episode, and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?\n- What kind of follow-up or monitoring should we do to keep an eye on his heart health?\n- Is there anything long-term we should be concerned about, or could this be a sign of something else?\nBeyond my family history, if you remember this time last year I was solving his cardio problem. I think that was a total of five appointments in three\nweeks? I also track everything with his medication and ADHD treatment. I hope you will involve me next time. I know more about Max and his\nhealth and medication than anyone alive, including him. I can help.\nSent:08/16/2024 at 12:50 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 03:21 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max\nMessage 3723 of 4024\nMax is home and resting. Everything is normal. I’ll share more in the morning\nSent:08/16/2024 at 03:22 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 08/16/2024 at 07:23 AM)\nSubject:Re: Max",
