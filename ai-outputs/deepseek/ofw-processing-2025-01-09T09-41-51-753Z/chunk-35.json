After months of intense emotional connection, I kissed you and our kids goodbye as you left for\nHong Kong. The same people never returned. The moment you landed, you were bombarded with a stream of hate and vitriol. Our daughter missed\nher flight, and somehow, this was all your fault because you got the boys on the plane but not our 31-year-old.\nIt was as if a long-dormant emotional monster, held inside for the last three decades, was suddenly unleashed. Elsa berated you relentlessly, telling you\nover and over what an awful mother you were and how you had ruined her life. It was unbearable, and then you asked me to step in; the abuse was\nsoul-crushing, and to be honest, you sounded as if you would break. Even as I tried, I could not stem the tide of Elsa, the blame, the hate.\nIn the following days, you revisited the same spots you frequented when you were pregnant as a teenager, staring at the harbor with the sights and\nsounds of Hong Kong in full effect. The vibrant colors of the city, the bustling streets, and the smell of the sea must have triggered a flood of\nmemories. My heart aches for the emotions you must have felt and the onslaught of painful memories you endured on the heels of the assault.\nThen you talked with Lilian, who piled on with stories of me being drunk on a visit before the pandemic. I had embarrassed your family and never\nbeen back to apologize. This was unforgivable, and she let it be known what a coward I was for my absence, not apologizing face-to-face even years\nlater. I deeply regret this incident and acknowledge that my past actions seriously strained our relationship. For that, I am genuinely sorry.\nOur minds, fresh from our own spring of self-created amateur “mushroom therapy” to help ease our own trauma and PTSD scars, were perhaps also\nopen to triggers we were unaware of. It was the downside of uncontrolled experimentation with neuroplasticity, And we would never be the same. All\nthe pain, anguish, and deep hurt came out in our next phone call. After all that was happening and a well-deserved reason to blame me, I became the\ntarget.\nAfter the best months of our life as a family and married couple, I was the problem now and had been all along from this point of view. Everything\nthat had happened and gone wrong since leaving Hong Kong was my fault. Then, after you landed, Max told me that in Hong Kong, you had decided\nto divorce me when you all got home. Since then, my life has been rewritten, and others have taken over my marriage and parenting.\nThe changes have profoundly affected our children in the last year, who left that day as happy and optimistic kids and now see us as lifelong enemies.\nMy primary concern has always been their well-being, and I am committed to maintaining a healthy relationship with them even as this explodes\naround us. I have continued to take steps towards sobriety and reconciliation and worked hard to improve myself as a parent.\nSent:07/01/2024 at 06:36 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 07:05 PM)\nSubject:6/30 An Anniversary of Sorts\nAttachments:Screenshot_2024-07-01_183008.jpg (431 KB)\n\nI am fully committed to cooperating with professionals, including Connor and Jennifer, to ensure the best possible outcomes for them. I hope for a\npositive co-parenting relationship with you, and I am dedicated to providing a stable, nurturing environment for Max and Adrian. My goal is to move\nforward constructively, focusing on the well-being of our children and the potential for a harmonious family dynamic and will continue.\nI have done so much research and pored over books, presentations, and white papers, all of which I am happy to share with you. But please know that\nIt is very possible that the intense emotional experiences and unresolved past traumas, combined with mushrooms, triggered a mental regression in us.\nPsychedelic substances sometimes unlock deep-seated memories, bringing them to the surface in unexpected and overwhelming ways.\nThe sudden flood of painful memories and unresolved trauma, especially those tied to your formative years in Hong Kong, could have caused an\nintense psychological reaction that may have led to a well-deserved sense of anger and overdue blame towards me that had been simmering for years. It\nwas what we talked about fixing before you left. Understanding this does not excuse any harm I have done, but it might help explain the instant\nchange.\nOur passion burns white-hot on both sides of the coin. There is no in-between with us. We went from being the two most seemingly in love people\nthe world had ever seen to mortal enemies. So for one moment, just a moment, please, after 30 years together, fighting like cats and dogs and\nsnuggling toes and making love, consider the fact that perhaps we flew too close to the sun and our wings melted. But let's remember who we were,\nacknowledge who we've become, and see if we can forge a new path of understanding. But we don’t have to hate each other.\nIt's been a long year. May we please consider a change?\nMessage 3409 of 4024\nI asked Adrian how he knew the details of your Bellevue home, including rent, as you implied I told him. I have been very careful not to discuss this.\nHe indicated that he saw this on your computer screen at the Old Bellevue place, says he saw the rent of 7,767 or something like that.\nGiven that this information came from you, I trust you will correct the record for anyone you have shared that I gave him this information.\nSent:07/01/2024 at 07:59 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/01/2024 at 08:03 PM)\nSubject:Adrian/details of Bellevue home\nMessage 3410 of 4024\nThe number is wrong but I have not shared that with anyone. Did I say that in anything you saw?\nI wish you would not go to him and question him about our conversations. I don’t know what your intentions are, but it shows him things he says to\nme might result in an interrogation for mom. Like the California thing I thought we cleared up.\nLet’s don’t blow it out or proportion though. It’s a thing we can work on. Not a big deal.\nAnd today was a win! Neither of us got what we wanted but we did not yell or hang up on each other. We both communicated some outstanding\nconcerns without loosing it. You also let me apologize for past comments and name calling. To me that’s a start!\nIf we can keep it up we might make progress! Let’s decide if we can make some more quick decisions that make us both equally unhappy...\nThanks again!!!\nSent:07/01/2024 at 08:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/02/2024 at 05:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian/details of Bellevue home\n\nMessage 3411 of 4024\nI’ll give you the deets on parking and set up when I’m done... it’s quirky.

Zero.\nPlease call, and we can cut it short if we can't make progress, but I'm all in for the kids.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 05:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3499 of 4024\nHey-\nYou called but refused to talk about anything related to the kids. All you did was fight and make accusations. You even piled on about Lisa's\ntestimony. I am trying to ask you to stop fighting all the time and think about the kids.\nEvery single call is all your personal agenda. You just can't help yourself. Even for a moment. May we please have the call I asked for instead of you\nscreaming about Lisa? I don't really care to discuss that. I only care about my kids.\nIs there anything on earth I can do to persuade you to think about Max and Adrian? Anything?\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Kids This Week\nMessage 3500 of 4024\nThis was what I tried to avoid with you today. I see this coming a mile away now.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Step Back\nMessage 3501 of 4024\nThis is what I wanted to discuss, but you ignored. Please respond.\nPlease do not misinterpret or redirect with things I have not said.\nThis is super kids-focused and what I wanted to talk about today.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule\n\nMessage 3502 of 4024\nHere is what I had asked of you that I wanted to reach an agreement on as well for the kids:\n\"’l'll just wait till everyone is home before reaching out.\nAre there things I can ask about that you all did so we can have a natural conversation and it not feel like “spying.”\nI want him to feel at ease and see we are aligned when it comes to him. We don’t keep secrets and this is normal.\"\nPlease let me know so I can engage in a way that he feels comfortable. AD has not picked up in five days, and that gives me pause with your travel\nplans and our inability to work together on healthy solutions. You did not even answer this.\nI'll also ask that you give Max his gifts that I have sent to the house. It is important that the kids know that even while you have declared all our war on\nme and removed every single reference to me in their lives, that I still think of them.\nIf this is going to be like my meds or UAs, and you are just going to refuse to give him my gifts, please let me know. I'll obviously have to make it a\nlegal issue, but I REALLY do not want to do that for something as simple and reasonable as this.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Moyer International Travel Plans\nAttachments:CupNoodlesforMax.JPG (333 KB)\nMessage 3503 of 4024\nYour position is there is no reason the kids do not have time with you.\nThere is no reflection or acknowledgement of the cumulative and long lasting impact your actions over the decades have had on all of us.\nTo attack the family that provided support and protection to kids and I, and to yourself over decades is telling.\nTo state it is all heresay is also telling. Why even look from that viewpoint unless you intend to deny all the incidents or take the position that everyone\nis lying.\nYou did everything that was been outlined. Every one of them.\nYour position is either we are all lying or yes you did it, but ignore the impact.\nUltimately we all know the truth.\nIf you are able to convince Connor or others,  what has been described were lies made up by me, kids, family and friend’s, that will be informative as\nwell. Everyone who has been impacted will have their own perspective and view of that outcome, but facts don’t change.\nSent:07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/08/2024 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: summer schedule",
