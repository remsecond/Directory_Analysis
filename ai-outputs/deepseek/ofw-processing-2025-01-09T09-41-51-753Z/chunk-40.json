This is just like when you said I called you a liar today but said, \"I was unaware.\" This\nstuff is all written down, Christine.\nOn the night of the ER visit, I complained that you unilaterally decided against Dr. Kwan's orders to discontinue his medication without telling him.\nThis bothered me because when we had just seen Dr. Kwan, you both noted Max was taking it on and off and had dropped 8 lbs. We all worked on a\nplan. You adjusted his Vyvanse to 30 mg from 40mg, agreed he would take it daily, and had a small meal before bed.\nI was expressing my concern about your disregard for Dr Kwan's orders. And it would be reasonable to ask the question at least if it could have been a\npart of the reason we were there.  You have said it was not after taking to him. That is good news for everyone.

It’s Latin for “I love you.” It was our special thing. We don’t do that now. It’s days since we\ntalked. He was “mini me “ as you called him. We had a bond so strong in Dec that Dr Brown repeatedly called it out as a possible issue. We were “too\nclose” she said.\nWe went to Cabo on our own, multiple times. You like to say on one night he thought I was drunk. That’s what you say. But we got our wires crossed\nduring the national championship game and could not find each other for a few minutes.

Even using the same\nplaybook.\nThe funny thing about this all is that I always said we had a busted system. We needed help. But you have put the singular blame on me. Never seeing\na good day in 30 years together. That’s crazy btw.

And even though all evidence points toward both my ongoing sobriety for\na year now, and many months of positive trip reports, you cling to a past to show I never changed so you can justify taking my kids. You simple ignore\nreality.\nBut it’s all there. Tests, shots, Alan’s reports. Even if I was the only problem and you are blameless for events years ago, you can’t deny what I am now.\nAnd have been. Yet you have still chosen to destroy the kids relationship with me. Taken their father away. And control my kids, my money, my\nhome, my future.\nLet’s see what today holds.... more ’s for me instead of trying to work together and actually answering questions that help us move forward in a\nconstructive way.
