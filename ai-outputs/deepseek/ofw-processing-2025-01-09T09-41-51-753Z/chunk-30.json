Open and transparent co-parenting is essential for providing Max and Adrian with the\nstable, nurturing environment they need.\nI respect your role as their mother and hope we can find a way to work together in a spirit of mutual respect, keeping their best interests at heart. I'm\ncommitted to being a collaborative co-parent and am open to mediation or counseling to help improve our ability to jointly care for our sons during\nthis challenging time.\nMy goal is for us to make parenting decisions together, with input from professionals like educators and healthcare providers when needed. The kids\ndeserve to have both parents fully engaged and informed about their lives.\nI also wanted to address a concern I have about our communication. I worry that our current platform may not be serving its intended purpose of\nfostering open and constructive dialogue. It's crucial that we maintain a safe space to discuss matters related to our children without fear of our words\nbeing misconstrued or weaponized against either of us.\nGiven the recent history, involving third parties in our communication complicates matters further. So I hope we can find a way to communicate\ndirectly, focusing on our shared goal of co-parenting effectively. If you feel that the current platform is not meeting our needs, I am open to exploring\nalternative methods that allow us to communicate transparently and collaboratively.\nI understand that communication has been difficult, but I genuinely believe that we can find a path forward by focusing on our shared love for Max\nand Adrian. I'm committed to creating a safe and constructive space to discuss these matters.\nI believe if we can approach this as a team, with empathy and a commitment to healthy dialogue, we can improve our co-parenting relationship. I'm\nhoping you'll be willing to work with me on this directly. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. I'm here and ready to work on positive\nsolutions for our family.\n-robert\nSent:05/15/2024 at 04:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/15/2024 at 07:30 PM)\nSubject:OFW\n\nMessage 2853 of 4024\nHi Robert,\nI have shared on numerous occasions the communications you send on OFW are inappropriate.

I will try to be flexible to accommodate you.\nI spent 20 min typing up a detailed response about the deck and OFW ate it and I’m not doing it again.\nBut- the things we need to address are not going away any more than the 60k credit card bill is.\nAnd the lawyers are not going to help get to the bottom of it before August. So let’s at least talk.\nIf we agree to move it to their plate, fine. We can add  2k and six weeks to the bill and move on then.\nBut I feel like you have a good attorney at last and we can work together better now as a result.\nPlease just let me know...\nSent:05/23/2024 at 05:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/23/2024 at 06:39 PM)\nSubject:Re: Chat\nMessage 2883 of 4024\n?\nSent:05/24/2024 at 04:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/24/2024 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Chat\n\nMessage 2884 of 4024\nLet’s connect after weekend.

Especially after the last book I read. It’s like they had a camera on our family. It’s for\nreal scary.\nSent:05/26/2024 at 10:05 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/26/2024 at 10:23 AM)\nSubject:Karri’s Mail\n\nIn a nutshell...Kari says to wait for a parenting plan for the family discussion. I have a list of seven of those documented now. And the GAL has no\ndate in sight.\nShe is wrong. She is trying to avoid a honest and true discussion. And going into our second summer, waiting on plan number eight is irresponsible.\nHappy to share the book. But it’s incredibly enlightening about all the damage we’re doing. And also the way that kid therapist can screw up families.\nHer recommendation in the face of our very real and documented history and subsequent results is so tone deaf it’s disappointing. Always a reason to\ndelay.\nI learned this book is a standard in the field, held out as a teaching too and it speaks to our situation with more accuracy than if we had written it\nourselves.\nWe should act with more urgency. Kids don’t always have the resilience she describes. It’s actually a horrible and devastating reality to understand.\nHope you are having a great holiday with the boys.\nLooking forward to our chat!\nMessage 2890 of 4024\nAgree we have a difference in perspective.\nWe have reunification therapy starting which is intended to address this.\nSent:05/26/2024 at 12:15 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 05/26/2024 at 12:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: Karri’s Mail\nMessage 2891 of 4024\nTotally.

I hope I did what I could given the info I had. But bad data leads to bad decisions. And Max and AD will never be the same as a\nresult.\nAs we kick off reunification therapy I’m hopeful we can take inventory of the impact of misleading one another. Maybe stop the bleeding from this\nstuff.\nAnyway just sharing as fyi if you want to send a note.\nSent:05/28/2024 at 02:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/29/2024 at 02:00 PM)\nSubject:Anniversary & Reunification\nAttachments:IMG_0493.PNG (736 KB)",
