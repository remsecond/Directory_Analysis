You know she has sent numerous messages to Lisa\nabout pursuing legal action against me if I do anything that violates your admittedly wrong RO. That feels like an attempt to get me to do that.\nThis whole thing boils down to the fact that you are taking a statement by me so literally that it's counterproductive. You secretly took $10k from an\naccount where I said the money was earmarked. I responded by saying I don't do that to our BofA account so you could manage bills.\nIn response, you've gone through and picked out my grocery bills at Safeway, a $300 withdrawal, and a single bill pay to create some false equivalency\nas if you're catching me out. Then used that to ask me If the activity was fraud. I confirmed below that no action was necessary from you.\nSo, from my perspective, it feels like you're playing games. Between the email with Natalie CC'd, ignoring the fact that I said no action is necessary\nbelow, and the comparison between my grocery shopping at Safeway and you taking $10k, I feel like you are harassing me now.\nI also sent an OFW message earlier today asking that we stand down as we are too triggered, and it would be counterproductive. You agreed but then\ndoubled down 'off platform.' I don't know how to work with you, Christine. Please consider a more constructive way for us to collaborate.\n-robert\nSent:06/05/2024 at 04:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 06:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3025 of 4024\nAre we good here?

We had an excellent time as always.\nDuring our last visit, Adrian was really focused on making sure his room was ready here, as we had put it off in the past given our circumstances. We\nspent about an hour and a half getting it set up, which wasn’t mentioned in the last report. The first thing he did when he arrived was run downstairs\nto check if everything was still good to go, and it was.This is important to him.\nLater, we looked through pictures on my phone since all the family photos had been removed from his house. I did this to show him that he comes\nfrom\na place of love and ensure that we are all included in the pictures. We had a great time reminiscing, and Adrian enjoyed telling \"his own stories\" behind\nthe pictures. I texted him the slideshow so he could\nkeep those memories close and promised more.\nInstead of our usual action movie, Adrian wanted to watch \"IF,\" a childhood movie about a 12-year-old who keeps a picture of them and their parents\nfrom better times. The story is about not losing a parent and honoring family memories. It was incredibly poignant and hit close to home.\nFortunately, the movie had a happy ending with the child reuniting with their dad. Talk about a tear-jerker.\nAdrian's last two basketball games were tough, with emotional meltdowns. This time, I was able to spend time with him beforehand. He really\nenjoyed\nthe game, was happy, laughing, and during the game, he came off the bench and said, \"Nothing is wrong, Dad. I just wanted to tell you how much I\nlove you.\" For a 12-year-old boy, doing that in front of his team was a big deal to me. A WOW moment.\nSent:06/09/2024 at 02:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/09/2024 at 04:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Communications\n\nI am grateful Adrian got an opportunity to remember what we truly were for a bit.

Your purpose in life is to hate, destroy, and rewrite our history and make sure everyone believes your false\nnarrative.\nI’m choosing the truth and a path towards a way that does not make our kids hate a part of themselves. The part that is each of us. You want the\nopposite.\nI had asked for a break, not another escalation.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 06:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 08:29 AM)\nSubject:Re: Call\nMessage 3132 of 4024\nSo much for civil.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 08:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 08:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Call\n\nMessage 3133 of 4024\nThat was the path you choose.\nI tried several times yesterday.\nI asked to stop and quit flaming.\nYou doubled down as always.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 08:39 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 10:14 AM)\nSubject:Re: Call\nMessage 3134 of 4024\nWould you like to try again?\nSent:06/12/2024 at 11:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 01:32 PM)\nSubject:Sooo...\nMessage 3135 of 4024\nIs there a motive behind agreeing to this and never responding?

That said, I do watch and make moves that maximize our gains. I have always done this, and the market has\nnever beaten me.\nWhile I do not claim to be an expert, I feel like I am super lucky or have enough domain knowledge in the tech sector to make reasonably sound\npredictions.\nExamples include exiting Tesla, entering Nvida, and selling AMD and MSFT at 52-week highs. You would have been out on those moves and lost\npotential gains.\nSo... if we wanted to consider an approach where I sell something (AMZN or AMD) and we spilt those proceeds now w/o splitting everything, it\nmight behoove you to consider.\nI am not going to die on this hill. I will continue to manage my portfolio and try to do what I have always done. But if you want to slipstream off that,\nI am happy to continue.\nIf you do not understand what I am saying or think I am trying to do something nefarious, I will be doing it to myself as well in this scenario, which I\nhave no interest in doing.\nWe may be fighting like cats and dogs right now, but long term I want you to be as successful as we always have been. And I'm rooting for you for you\nto do great things.\nI don't like you right now, but I still love you and always will. I'm happy to explain or discuss.\nMessage 3143 of 4024\nI need to process what you are saying\nSent:06/12/2024 at 05:01 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/12/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea\nMessage 3144 of 4024\nI can make a slide to show you.

And we each get 50%. I assume that it\nwould be used for discretionary spending. The net being is we don't want to pay for each other's Botox or massages.  We would need to agree on that\ndefinition, but we could do that.\nSo, if that is the case and the lawyers are interpreting your ask correctly, I will proceed. If that is not the case and the lawyer <-> lawyer\ncommunications are not aligned, I am happy to just wait till they figure it out, or you can tell me. But whatever it is, I don't care to argue or fight. I'm\ntrying to help you so it's not worth the argument.\nSent:06/12/2024 at 07:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/13/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: mo monies... an idea\nMessage 3147 of 4024\nI’m watching GAL stuff. It’s very scary. He has full legal rights to ALL our texts and emails. Did you guys talk about that at all? We have so many\nnaughty pics. I know we won’t ever be together again but the idea of another man seeing your pics and our dirty conversations makes me sick, sad and\nqueasy.\nDo you know if there is any way to be able to not turn over the intimate stuff. I can’t stop crying right now over the idea of someone else seeing you\nnude that way. It’s not their business. It has nothing to do with this. Plus I sent a bunch of b*ner pics.
