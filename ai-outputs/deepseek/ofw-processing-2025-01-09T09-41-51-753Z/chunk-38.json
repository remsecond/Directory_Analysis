As we discussed, it is a simple request to address outstanding issues without including the attorneys. But I don’t know what\nyou are expecting if you are not responsive. Please help me figure out how.\n- On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's\nbeen fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?\n- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.\nI have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.\n- On 8/17, after asking several times about our Seahawks tickets, I tried to make some progress. Obviously, AD's decision to honor his wishes matter\nSent:08/29/2024 at 11:38 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/29/2024 at 12:57 PM)\nSubject:May We Please Work Together?\n\nhere since we do every game together. I’m still waiting to hear back on this decision.\n- On 8/18, I felt like we had a huge breakthrough. You expressed a willingness to consider divorce counseling for the kids under Jennifer’s guidance. I\nhave gone to great lengths to meet your every wish, but you still won’t confirm.\n- On 8/23, you told me as you went off the grid that I could not have contact info for our kid's caretaker, despite mix-ups the prior day and an ER\nvisit with Max days before. You said we would discuss why, but still have not.\n- On 8/28, I pointed out that you and Alan seem to be talking past each other about the “regular schedule.” We are less than two days away, and your\nspeed in responding to these questions worries me for the weekend.\nOn 8/28, I noted that the AAU hoops email was out and that we should have Adrian’s team assignment or at least a pointer to when we see his\nschedule so we can plan. You have chosen not to reply to that mail at this time.\nI have other issues also, like the kids in Macau w/o a release, Nanna’s upcoming visit, DV accusations during our ER visit, disregarding Dr Kwon, and\nmy SAAS involvement. But I am shouting into the abyss at this point.\nWe used to have our “running list” meetings, but this has been the pattern over the last six months since you ended them. May we please stop this and\nsincerely work together without the attorneys? I really want us to heal.\nThere is no ill will or animosity on my part by sending this reminder. But I really don’t know how to try any harder to work peacefully with you to\nresolve mutual issues if you don’t reply or take days to do so. Please help me help us.\nThanks,\nrobert\nMessage 3846 of 4024\nYou realize what we did today was a miracle, right?\nWe made those happen for 30 years.

Their only regulars, at \"our table\". No limes in our soda water. Every\nweek w/o fail, we made it. We did whatever we had to do to be sure we had our regular date night. It was our reward and a special time for Mom and\nDad to kick off our \"mini-vacation,\" as you would thank me each week.\nWe waited for the oysters to see what crazy thing the chef wanted to top them with. Then came the charcuterie, the bok choy, and a nice seabass or\npork chop if we felt brave. And we would chat. We talked about how great we were and how CRAZY Brian and Tomoko's husbands were. Who on\ngod's green earth would not sober up to see their own kids?\nThey had to be supervised! That was crazy to us. It seemed as unimaginable as the first dates going on at the tables next to us. It was totally alien. Then\nwe would pay with Beth's gift certificate and laugh so hard you peed your pants on the way home to enjoy a White Lotus or Succession, followed by\nthe best part of the evening. We were happy—truly happy together.\nSent:08/29/2024 at 10:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 08/30/2024 at 06:54 AM)\nSubject:Since you compared me to Brian today...\nAttachments:Where_I__Land.jpg (401 KB)\n\nSo please take a moment to consider if I am one of those guys. With no demonstrated history of solo care? Not able to stop abusing? Was not a\ncoach or volunteer? Did not play Uber for all the kids' friends? No ongoing program to assure their sobriety, And no sterling history of supervised\nvisits for six months since this started without even a hiccup along the way. I'm not them.\nBut please, with that in mind, check out the custody table attached. Take a look at the splits. Look where they landed, and then look at me.

We can do this.\nMessage 3848 of 4024\nThis is starting a fight.\nThis message shows to me there is a total lack of recognition of the terror and fear the kids and I lived through. How it could happen without warning\nor provocation on our side. It was terrifying we had to escape even in periods last Sept, Oct, you unequivocally state you were sober. The anger is\nterrifying. The SBUX incident in April chasing my car banging on it. That is terrifying. The cameras. I could go on.\nYesterday you felt it appropriate to shame me for not turning on the camera.
