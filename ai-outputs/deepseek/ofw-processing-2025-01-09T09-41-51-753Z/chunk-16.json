Here's a general overview of potential public consequences:\nSent:02/16/2024 at 07:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:48 PM)\nSubject:Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me\n\nWhen someone has a restraining order issued against them, it will have several public and personal consequences, some of which may significantly\naffect their future life and activities.\nHere's a general overview of the consequences:\n\nemployers conduct background checks they will view the restraining order as a serious negative character reference. Professions involving trust and\nsecurity (like teaching, law enforcement, information technology, or positions that require security clearances), will be particularly impacted.\n\nthem, fearing potential legal issues or disturbances.\n\nA restraining order could negatively impact these opportunities.\n\nwill view you differently based on the existence of the order, which can lead to social isolation or difficulties in personal relationships.\n\nprofessions require the use of firearms or individuals who hunt or participate in shooting sports.\n\nmobility. This might include common areas like a shared workplace, school, or even shared children's locations in cases of domestic issues.\n\nvisitation rights with children.\n\nabout you and why you have the order placed on you.\n\nmay affect the ability to obtain professional licenses in the first place.\nQuestion: That sounds really terrible for someone who has one filed against them. Are the details of the restraining order public so anyone can find\nthem? Example: If my wife said that likely to physically assault her and my kids would someone be able to see that?\nThe details of a restraining order, including any reasons for its issuance and the specific restrictions it imposes, are a matter of public record for anyone\nto see. This means that the information contained within the restraining order, such as allegations of expected physical violence towards a spouse and\nchildren, are fully accessible to the public at large. Here are some exceptions:\n\nrestraining orders to be public records, the ease with which someone can access these records can vary but most make these records searchable and\navailable online.\n\nindividuals to search for and find details of restraining orders, who they were filed by and against, and the reasons for filing the restraining order.\n\noverarching details of the order will be public, but the names of minors could be redacted or otherwise protected.\nIndividuals concerned about the privacy of their information in legal documents like restraining orders should consult with a legal professional to\nunderstand the specifics of their situation. The long-term negative consequences of a restraining order on the restricted person are not to be\nunderstated. They have lifelong, enduring and very public consequence to the restrained person.\n\nMessage 1476 of 4024\nDaily share...\nSent:02/16/2024 at 07:45 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nAttachments:IMG_1448.PNG (4 MB)\nMessage 1477 of 4024\nThis is what YOUR lawyer suggested to mine.\nI’m sure your counsel walked you through what an RO was and impact it has before you signed.\nIn fact YOU REQUESTED ONE AGAINST ME!\nSo what you are saying I did to you, was what you were prepared to do to me, for having a Tesla app that you knew could verify I only logged on to\nunlock your car twice at your instruction.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me\nMessage 1478 of 4024\nHave you called  Xfinity’s to ask why and be removed?\nSent:02/16/2024 at 07:55 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 07:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1479 of 4024\nMy lawyer suggested a ROnto restrict digital surveillance.

Or the impossible reconnect that you see the TVs do too?\nYou still did not answer the single most and original question I sent.two days and roughly eight hours ago. I have approval to see Adrian from Dr\nBrown. That was your requirement. So how do I see him now?\nYou also completely skipped the question about doing as Dr Brown had asked us to do and you committed to last week. So we begin to work more\npeacefully and constructively together again.\nAnd as you consider how I downplayed things in my past, do you think you might have downplayed your affair with Kevin? It was worth flat out\nlying about to your husband’s face. Did you downplay that at all?\nAs you reply, may I ask you to save the extra words as I do for you. Also please answer the questions. If this is the only format you will permit, it will\ndo us good if you can show even the most primitive attempt here.\nGiven the “emergency” exception noted, how do I get in touch in that case? You plan to stick to this I see, and say I beat you and my kids (the truth\nwill come out) but I don’t know how to reach you, right?\nSent:02/21/2024 at 05:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/21/2024 at 05:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Next Steps\nMessage 1517 of 4024\nYou meet with Dr. Brown on Friday.

That is what I keep asking you. You keep saying she is going to do as we asked, over and\nover you say that. But then you say she is going to adjust the Parenting Plan. That's not what we asked. That was one very small part of this that may\nor may not be necessary. It makes me feel like you think I am so fucking stupid that I don't understand. I can read two things and see if they are or are\nnot alike. Adrian can do that.\n\nHere is what we have agreed to:\nGoal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\nScope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nway we handled it.\nParticipants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns.\nDeliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our\nparenting plan if necessary.\nHow We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being\nformally approved.

It’s too bad. But I will note that to a person, every single one of the mental health professionals have seem to this point say I need\nto practice radical acceptance and move on with my life. I can appreciate that.\nBut equally consistent is that you have a lot of stored trauma and you are dealing with it as best you can, but it definitely would have been better for\nus to tackle it together, through therapy, prior to reaching the point of no return.\nThere was always the possibility we could have saved the Moyer’s if we had only tried CPR. But we didn’t.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 01:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 02:54 PM)\nSubject:Mental Health Professionals\nMessage 1570 of 4024\nI am not sure Adrian is ready for the overnight not am I comfortable at this time.\nIf you want to take him to the sneaker convention after basketball I am fine.

And I do trust your judgment. But please review the parenting plan update.\nThe only change to visitation for AD is the formalized addition for one weekly day time visit. She says there is no issue with the original schedule.\nI am really hoping with this last pass we have fine tuned and can move forward in a positive way. I really will make all the effort you allow to be kind.\nThanks!\nSent:02/23/2024 at 03:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 03:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\n\nMessage 1573 of 4024\nIn discussing with him he doesn’t think practice tonight is a good idea.

Thanks! Appreciate the update. I trust you.\nFeel free to include me in decisions so you don’t have to be the gatekeeper for “Adrian access” now that we have a plan again. I’m more than happy to\nengage like I’m actually his dad. I would have offered him to come play NCAA for a couple hours since it was his Xmas gift and he has not had it for\nsix weeks.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 04:07 PM)\nSubject:Re: On Platform\nMessage 1575 of 4024\nPlease make sure you get it on Adrian‘s knee as quickly as possible. If he is not able to come to practice, he should have that iced to prevent further\nswelling and irritation that will limit the time to heal.\nI am more than happy to sit and explain to you when you use heat and when you use cold to help get you better in the case of soft tissue issues.\nTreating it properly as soon as possible makes a big difference.\nSent:02/23/2024 at 04:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 06:12 PM)\nSubject:Ice\nMessage 1576 of 4024\nStill going strong\nSent:02/23/2024 at 05:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/23/2024 at 06:13 PM)\nSubject:Re: Xfinity\nAttachments:IMG_1588.PNG (3 MB)\nMessage 1577 of 4024\nDo you have time to discuss the parenting plan update?
