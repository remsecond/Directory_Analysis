It sucks but you did a great job here. I think we start with what you are sending. I can only digest so much at a time.\nAlso worried about sending a bunch of stuff that just needs to go back in 8 months. The last conversation we had was me taking over the Kirkland\nmortgage.\nThat said, if it is in your way, of course I want to get it out of your eyesight. But we’re talking about deep into the garage at this point I think. Do you\nagree?\nNothing works for the Sonos unless I have the\ncloset piece.\nNo worries at all about the pillows. That can be whenever.\nWhat did you think about linen and towels? You suggested we refresh.\nI probably need to share other stuff for taxes like my unemployment info.\nHope you are keeping the good extender. I will help when you are ready.\nThey can only move the heater head. No propane. So it needs to be removed.\nAre the socks good or are they the ones we said we would give to Max.\nThe other clothes I’d like to see before we move them. Still ten bags here.\nI would take my backpacks I think. But I owe you luggage back.\nReally appreciate the planning. We will get there!\nSent:02/03/2024 at 07:38 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\n\nMessage 1028 of 4024\nBTW- I am fine when we are trying to go back and forth with line items or answering more than a single question, doing it for that part only in email.\nThis is not designed for that. It’s for short, single subject, tweet length communication.

I had emptied out the closet and dresser drawers so likely workout gear, ski clothes and\nlayers and the other items mentioned below. I’ll put whatever you don’t want sent over in garage so I can rent furniture for front room.\nBox of promo video cassettes.,throw or send?\nSent:02/03/2024 at 08:20 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\nMessage 1030 of 4024\nSo... we definitely discussed. You said that you could make it work. But definitely wanted to move. I offered to see if I could help (when we were on\ngood terms) but you said no. Then I made it clear i planned to try and keep it in the family for the boys sake. It’s all discussed in email. I have never\nheard that you want to change your mind. That’s why I have so much heartburn moving every little thing since I’m coming back.\nFeel free to send socks\nThanks for Sonos\nWhat are “promo videos”\nSounds good on clothes. I want you to have your space. I am hopeful we’ll find peace and civility at some point (this is neither healthy or sustainable\nlong term) and then we can work on garage together and I sort what I keep vs. goodwill.\nSent:02/03/2024 at 08:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 08:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki Keys\n\nMessage 1031 of 4024\nCurious why you read some mails, then skip others, like this earlier one.

I know we enjoyed our love making. I also know you saw I was getting better. Changing the man I was to be the man you\nasked me to be. I was all in.\nSo you can have a pov on the bad times. That’s fair. But there is no way you can deny that when you were cold, I kept you warm. When you were\nhungry, I fed you. And when you cried, I held you.

You are asking me to revert back to behavior in\nthe marriage where I pretend things did not happen, brush it off, act happy, and not hold you accountable. That has stoped. I recognize my feelings\nand impact and do not just move on. As I process each scary or volatile interaction in a manner that it deserves, and they continue or escalate, it\ncompounds and gets worse as there is no recognition that you don’t start back at zero each time. It is still in a deficit that keeps getting worse. This\nbehavior and reaction from me and family is what you do not recognize, which is holding you firmly accountable each time. It does not reset at zero\nlike it did in the past.\nThe past 7 months does not demonstrate that is the path we are on.\nSent:02/04/2024 at 08:37 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/04/2024 at 08:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Move\nMessage 1082 of 4024\nI want to thank you for this. It took time, you put thought into it, and it all makes perfect sense to me. I will not justify my reaction to our situation\nbut I always have held firm that V Little on June 30th would be proud that I was fighting Christine of July 5th. That I would do anything to save our\nmarriage and keep our family together, fending off anyone who would destroy it. And that’s what I see happening.\nThat misses the point entirely. I do think she would appreciate me fighting to learn, heal, and have a better, stronger rebirth that puts us on course for\nforever. But what I am missing is the way I’m doing it is the entire reason we are here. The thought is noble, the execution is destructive. It’s like a\nChinese finger trap, the harder I fight and struggle, the worse it gets for us both. She would not like that at all.\nIf I continue the swings, the volatility, the madness, after you made yourself clear tonight in a very thoughtful way, I deserve to never walk down that\npath with you. Alternatively, if I show you I listened, like I had listened this spring, and work on myself for the sake of us, I hope it has a better ending.\nI realize I have reverted, I thought about it tonight. But I can get back on the right path again. I will show you.\nSo thank you for the honest feedback. And while it would have been great to hear in June, I do hear it now and I am acknowledging it. I’ll let my\nactions do the talking and hope for the best. Both the June 30th and July 5th, Christine’s would want that.\nI truly love you, Christine...\nforever yours,\nrobert\nSent:02/04/2024 at 08:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 07:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Move\n\nMessage 1083 of 4024\nSo I have a bunch of shoes that are not mine either.

Much appreciated. Awesome!!\nI am in a rental for 8 months. So essentially short term storage. The more we move to short term storage with an expiry date in Sept. the worse my life\nbecomes. If I end up in our home or not.\nGiven I might very well be moving back into the house as planned. Let’s hold on clearing everything out. You might end up there as well, but I’d\nprefer we err on the side of the last outcome we discussed.\nThat does not mean we can’t still sell stuff. Or even Swedish clean if you and I can learn to play nicely again. But I have two full rooms of unpacked\nboxes and if Max wants to visit ever has lost his bedroom.\nI am finding more things that can go back, so I’ll wait till we get to critical mass and we can bring them.\nYou gave some Xmas presents back so I assume you don’t want them anymore. Just gadgety stuff.\nVery expensive watches (Mavado) were almost lost. Do I have other valuables that I can look out for? They were with an empty bottle of talcom\npowder I tossed into the can till I heard the “thug” in the trash. Any way to tell the junk from my most expensive possessions?\nThanks again!! We are still going strong, almost a whole day under our belt! Do I see “sell the Porsche” possibilities on the distant horizon?)\nSent:02/05/2024 at 06:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:24 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max Size\n\nMessage 1138 of 4024\nIts filed. You said to the court I have committed domestic violence.\nSent:02/05/2024 at 07:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/05/2024 at 08:25 PM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\nMessage 1139 of 4024\nGood Morning,\nI have your revised RO. Thank you for getting Anna Lisa to send. Two questions on the terms that I hope that you and I can discuss more cost-\neffectively than the lawyers.\nWRT - [x] Credible Threat: The Restrained Person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the Protected Person.\nYesterday you told the court I had committed domestic violence. Today you are asking me to sign something that says I am a physical threat to you\nand the kids. My hands have been there to tie shoes, wipe tears, hold ice packs, make love, walk hand in hand, morning hugs, and make love. That is all\nthey are for with you and the boys.\nThat is what you have seen and I hope you know is true this morning. Do we need to say you believe that I will beat you and my children? I can't\nimagine in the deepest depths of my despair over our dissolution I would seek you out and physically harm you or our boys. Must you say that you\nbelieve this to be untrue and you think I will beat you all?\nWRT - The parties may also communicate via email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or\nmanaging the parties’ shared assets.\nThanks again for this. Very helpful. But as I have noted on many occasions that OFW is a terrible platform for much of our communications. It is\nbetter as a single subject, single reply, 124 characters, non-copy paste, short burst text tool. Most of the time we communicate on emails we have\nseveral things we are trying to resolve in somewhat complex multi-point situations.\nAnd more often than not, we actually do not want to conduct our \"sausage-making\" in front of the diner who will eat it. But your offer proposes that\nthey always have to be present on the thread, we can't drop them, resolve, and add them back. Can you please reconsider?\nThanks again for your efforts to partner constructively in a positive way. Given this is a timely conversation and Lisa is waiting on my direction, it\nwould be great if we could resolve ASAP.\nbest\nrobert\nSent:02/06/2024 at 08:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse",
