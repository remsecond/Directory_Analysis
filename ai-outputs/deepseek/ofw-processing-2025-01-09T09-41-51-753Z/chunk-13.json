Is she qualified to give her opinion when she has no idea what the heck is going on?\nI'll note that she also laid into me about screwing other women when we were married. She has no idea that started when you were 18 in Hong Kong,\nwe both participated and enjoyed it, but she only knows your side. Then there is her take on Kevin Otero and what you two did together.\nI trust Elsa to make smart decisions and contribute constructively. She just needs the full and accurate picture.

Robert and I have a different perspective on what unfolded and can share in our discussions. Our lawyers are also aligned with this\nproposed approach on how we might address this issue in relation to the parenting plan. Our proposal would be to schedule a conversation with our\nyoungest son Adrian to share his experience and impact to him, potentially our oldest daughter Elsa, myself and Robert.\nOur Ask:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nway we handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns.\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our\nparenting plan if necessary.\n- How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being\nformally approved. So TBD.\nDr Brown did not seem to do this at all. In any way. Either one of our asks above. I assume this was not a bait and switch, but the intent was clearly to\naddress Adrian's reaction to the cam incident and how we reunify safely and healthily.\nSo now I guess we will never address the cam, how we handled it, and when I can see our son.

But did you two meet and discuss this and she lied?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1306 of 4024\nIt’s always V1.\nI don’t hide anything from you guys. He can call if it’s a problem.\nHow can we sync on Dr Brown before you go dark? You clearly are privy to details I am not.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\n\nI am asking to discuss this with you. Will you please do that. I understand your perspective. I take it very seriously. That is why I went to great last\nnight to explain. May we please discuss rather than you going dark on what you and Dr Brown are doing?\nMessage 1307 of 4024\nCan you please respond?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:56 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1308 of 4024\nDr. Brown did not know the issue going into this.\nAfter Adrian shared with her, she asked me if I knew surveillance fell under this category to make sure I was aware. It is alarming and requires the\nappropriate safeguards. I said I did.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 04:57 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1309 of 4024\nHow did she not know? It was in the very first email from you.\nAnd you two did meet, despite her saying otherwise. So she is a liar?\nI am not trying to fight. I just want to find out what is really going on.\nCan we please discuss since there is clearly something going on?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr Brown\nMessage 1310 of 4024\nI’m not doing anything with Dr. Brown.\nSimilar to Yurishka, these individuals have a professional obligation to call out when they see harm or DV. They are obligated to Robert.\nPerhaps take a step back a think why all these people are ringing the alarm bell. Is it the entire world or is it you?\nIs everyone else just crazy?\nThis was Adrian’s story.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\n\nTake this to another lawyer and professional and let’s see the outcome. I guarantee it will be the same but for some reason you believe your perspective\nis correct.\nEvery single professional has had the same reaction to you over all these years. They must all be wrong. Let’s keep looking for another professional\nthat thinks your actions don’t amount to DV.\nMessage 1311 of 4024\nMax requested a verification code. Can you share please.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1312 of 4024\nSo I am not trying to fight. I am trying to communicate.\nShe lied to me. Period. If she had an obligation, that is fine. But she lied about what she did. I don’t think her obligation is to lie.\nIf you and I would like to go back and relitigate everything from the car to the phone to the Xfinity to the cam , we can. But that is not what we were\ntrying to do.\nIf you have changed your mind, I would just like to know . I am honestly trying to work with you here because I think in your heart you believe that\nthe boys should both have a dad.\nHow can we work together to understand our true intentions given that someone involved now is a liar ?\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1313 of 4024\nNo one lied.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:09 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:11 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1314 of 4024\nI’m trying...

She said when did not communicate with you. She did communicate with you. That was a lie.\nBut that is not the point, I’m trying to figure out how you and I work together so I can be a good dad to the boys. Finally, her being a liar is not that\nbig a deal.\nThis is ultimately up to you and I . and I’m trying to understand whether you want to re-litigate all this and I need to go back to my attorney and start\nover or if you and I want to figure out how I can see the boys in a safe and healthy way.\nI’m honestly not having an angry moment, so I hope it doesn’t come across in text that way . I am honestly in sincerely just trying to work with you\non our plan.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:13 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1316 of 4024\nI’m going to walk away from this and evaluate my next steps.\nI have tried to work on a parenting plan with you in good faith without involving parent evaluator or GA, despite what it appears to be the best\ncourse.\nI’m not threatening like you but at some point we need to admit it’s not working.\nSent:02/10/2024 at 05:17 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/10/2024 at 05:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Password\nMessage 1317 of 4024\nWait, I’m not threatening you at all.\nI am trying to work with you.

Is that what you’re doing because I don’t want that Christine. I want to work with you please.\nPlease don’t bail on this thread.
