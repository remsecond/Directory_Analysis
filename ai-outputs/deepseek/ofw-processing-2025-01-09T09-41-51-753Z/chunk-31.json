You asked to put it off five days. I did not bat after you refused to divulge the location of our children over the\nlong holiday. Just like over spring break. No surprise.\nI was open to moving it, but wanted to touch base here as Kari’s response was one of the topics. So hyper appropriate to OFW dialog. But it’s been\nover24 hours since you bothered checking in.\nSent:05/28/2024 at 09:25 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/29/2024 at 02:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Karri’s Mail\n\nI keep trying to extend an olive branch for the health and well being of our children.

If they are not in this week, she is out next week. Everything takes a month just to get started. Or several in the case\nof Dr Brown and Kari. And we are into our second summer now.

We both have a lot of narratives that we might choose to tear each other down, but I think you will be pretty\nsurprised by what our texts say day by day.\nExample: You may feel you have a pretty good case for gatekeeping and parental alienation, but it was not for safety. You confirmed it is just a legal\nstrategy from your 3rd lawyer in Oct.\nWe have both repeated so many things so many times we believe them. However, the actual texts do not support many of those narratives. They are\ncontradicted by our own words.\nMy meta point is that neither the GAL or Mediator can make a legal judgment of guilt. They only make recommendations. So I'm not sure what the\nend game is for tearing each other down.\nI'd like to have a peaceful discussion about working together and arresting the long-term damage we are doing to the kids for what is, at best, a costly,\nnear-term, destructive, and selfish victory.\nLet's get our heads together now, not later, to stop the senseless damage we are doing to our children. The people we work with next will want to see\nthat and appreciate our efforts if we do.\nWe spun out of control way too fast.

You and I are worse than we’ve ever been. and we have seen the impact on the kids and\ntheir relationships with me.\nThis is absolutely the opposite of what we had had envisioned when we started this. I’m not bugging you to chat today. But I am trying to plant the\nseed to perhaps over the weekend have the discussion. You know I read voraciously. And lately a lot of my focus has been on the impact of the\n“divorce business” on real families with real challenges. It’s not good.\nYou may disagree and think all this has been positive, and that’s your prerogative, but after we chat, perhaps you talk to your divorce crew and get\ntheir honest perspective. I’m guessing, but I doubt there will be a lot of positive feedback on the “business of divorce” and many of the people paying\nfor private schools working in it. It’s a meme for a reason.

It’s not good for anyone. And the public has no right to know all that you and I got up to as a couple or\nwith others outside our marriage. There is no benefit to that.\nIdeally we agree to chart a “least destructive path” forward that keeps our private life together, just that. We lasted 30 years. That is amazing. For real.

Let’s honor it and be proud of it.\nSo asking, do you want to team up at least on this?\nSent:06/05/2024 at 01:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 07:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: I am not fighting , let’s cool off , ok?\nMessage 3008 of 4024\nHow would you like to coordinate so I can participate in Adrian's birthday?\nSent:06/05/2024 at 07:33 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Adrian's Birthday\nMessage 3009 of 4024\nSpeak to your attorney\nSent:06/05/2024 at 07:56 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: Round up\nMessage 3010 of 4024\nBook them.

Do I cancel your debit card as it’s unauthorized?\nMoney withdrawals are happening and actual spend. Debit card fraud is incredibly difficult to get reimbursed if fraud so we need to notify bank\nimmediately. If you don’t answer I’ll get attorney guidance on this. You have stated you never spend in that account.\nApply for your own Visa. That will track your spend and is your personal liability.\nSent:06/05/2024 at 08:05 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 06/05/2024 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Visa Card\nMessage 3013 of 4024\nMy lawyer is on vacation.

Everything is transactional for you. It’s more than the investigation. I’m talking about the well-fair of our kids and keeping that part\nof them safe. So they can love and appreciate who they are, not feel shame. I’m trying to approach this in a holistic way where we can honor our past\nand not trash each other and that includes friends and family.\nYour response is always that it’s time to tell the truth. You’re tired of lying to people. I’m pretty sure that it’s up to you what you tell them about our\npast just as it is for me. I’ve been mum on all the things that we did. At the time we did them because we liked it. You, by contrast have started an\nadvertising campaign of destruction and defamation.\nSo I’m asking if can we agree to stop doing that and work on honoring the years we spent together. If you don’t understand, please take some time off\nwork and educate yourself. It’s not a knock, you just don’t  know. So I’m asking you to learn how your vengeful flamethrower approach is impacting\nthe kids.\nFrankly, I’m tired of having this discussion. All our messaging platforms are replete with examples of me, trying to get this under control and not treat\neach other in horrible, thoughtless, and inhumane ways that screw up our kids for the rest of their lives. I’m actually tired of trying to convince you to\nparent responsibly.
