Let’s stop the character\nassassination and recognize it’s better for our kids mental health.\nI’m not going to argue with you here today. I want to start doing right by the kids. I always build you up to them. I want them to look up to, respect,\nand be proud of you. It’s best for them if you do the same.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:15 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV\n\nMessage 224 of 4024\nThe email below is completely false. The kids therapist will be able to hear exactly what they heard in your abuse and screaming to me.\nIf you cared about the kids and I mental health, the abuse would have never started and continued. I have detailed notes.\nI do not care to debate your falsehoods in this forum.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD’s interest in DV\nMessage 225 of 4024\nThere is a difference in the way we start our days here. See attached. I’m going to try to continue the way I do it. We used to have (and what I see now\nwas crazy) an agreement to never start a day mad.\nI am hoping that in cases where you are itching for a fight, but still wait till the next day to unleash, that we can just put that hate on ice instead of\nruining another day straight from the get go. It’s a new day.\nNow we will have all day trying to grapple with the crap we could have dealt with before bed but decided to kick off the day with. My suspicion is\nactually you will drop a nuke and check out.\nThat’s just your style.\nSent:01/04/2024 at 08:28 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/04/2024 at 08:43 AM)\nSubject:Starting The Day\nAttachments:IMG_0763_1.PNG (252 KB)\n\nMessage 226 of 4024\nI’m learning....

We are mature enough not to make a big deal out of it. Ideally, we can be honest about each of our roles- both\ntriggering and responding. Given that two wrongs never make a right, we are equally at fault and share the blame 50/50.
