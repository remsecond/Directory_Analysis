I think you\nknow the timeline\nSent:03/25/2024 at 08:12 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/25/2024 at 08:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: Communication as Healthy Coparents\n\nMessage 2310 of 4024\nYeah, I get it. It's the same thing every week. It's just insulting to live Groundhog Day over and over. I have used the Charlie Brown & Lucy analogy so\nmany times that it's gotten tired and worn out. So, let me begin by highlighting once again my intention to engage in a cooperative process focused on\nour children's best interests, Max and Adrian. Those two boys and their mental health are my singular concern at this point.\nSeven months after I sent you my initial parenting plan, following the instructions of our co-parenting counselor (who you were secretly triangulated\nwith), we have yet to make progress. This is despite the involvement of five professionals and the creation of six plans consistent with our strategy to\nprioritize our children's well-being in a minimally invasive process to establish a our temporary parenting plan.\nHowever, after Dr. Brown's contributions were dismissed due to her purported lack of information and professional qualifications, coupled with the\nreflections that involving her was a mistake, indicated a broader and more profound issue. You have a pattern of dismissing professional advice to stall\nprogress and allow yourself more runway to alienate Max and Adrian further. Thereby creating a false reaffirmation of your self-fulfilling prophecy.\nWe are months and months into this pattern. It's so well documented that saying otherwise is not worth the airtime. But in Baseball Terms, the\nscoreboard reads:\nParenting Plans\n- Robert: Six\n- Christine: Nil\nExcuses for no Parenting Plan\n- Robert: Nil\n- Christine: ♾\nThis underscores our imbalance in effort and the missed opportunities to collaboratively establish a plan centered around Max and Adrian's well-\nbeing.\nFollowing our discussion with Ms. Betts and her confirmed unwillingness to contribute to a parenting plan or offer recommendations. A critical gap\nemerged in our joint commitment to the well-being of Max and Adrian. A commitment based on the guidance of qualified, child-centered therapists\ndriven by five therapists, six parenting plans, and the overdue addition of children's voices advocates.\nYour approach suggests an unwillingness to cooperate with professionals if their recommendations don't align perfectly with a preconceived legal\nstrategy to take the kids, a stance made very clear with Debbie Bayer in November. This prioritization of tactics over Max and Adrina's well-being\nundermines our collective decision-making process and, most importantly, their best interests.\nYour new strategy, however, seems to be taking the voice of parentally alienated, possibly mentally abused children (Max and Adrian) as your primary\ninput and ignoring the real and lasting damage of your unilateral policies over the last nine months. This feels akin to blindfolding Max and Adrian,\nplaying my voice while they endure a metaphorical lashing, and using their cries against me to justify your approach.\nRelying on this after-the-fact downstream data to support yourself and Google searches that align with your point of view to craft a temporary\nparenting plan is inconsistent with our agreed-upon approach. If your new legal strategy replaces Dr. Brown's comprehensive work (3.5 months, 900\nmeeting minutes, two parenting plans, tens of guidance and recommendations emails), I urge you to reconsider your approach.\nSeeing Max on Saturday, his transformation was so profound that I barely recognized him. The experience was incredibly painful. Adrian's shift from\nbeing my \"mini-me\" to almost no contact dramatically underscores the impact of your parenting decisions. Removing all family photographs and\ndigital memory frames, which chronicled years of our life together, makes sense. It is your \"digital book burning\" to erase our shared moments of joy,\nto achieve the same abhorrent intent as its traditional counterpart.\nSent:03/25/2024 at 11:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/25/2024 at 12:05 PM)\nSubject:Re: Communication as Healthy Coparents\n\nI thought this would be a quick reply, but after typing this far, I realize that the gravity of our situation requires a more comprehensive appeal. Your\ncurrent trajectory, prioritizing legal strategy over our children's mental and emotional well-being, is deeply concerning. I hope you will consider the\nmore profound ramifications of our ongoing conflict to Max and Adrian.\nGiven we are only moving backward, and the children have no father figure, only an evolving villain, I propose we recommit to setting aside our\ndifferences and engaging in meaningful, constructive dialogue. This is in the interest of Max and Adrian's health, happiness, and stability. As Dr.\nBrown keeps telling us, let's look forward instead of hurting the kids with personal retribution-based parenting decisions, a pattern I humbly suggest\nwe unfortunately share.\nAre you open to discussing next steps and how we prioritize the well-being of Max and Adrian?\n-robert\nMessage 2311 of 4024\nHey-\nPopping this to the top of your inbox.

It’s pivotal that we discuss this matter with them with\nutmost care, empathy, and clarity. A conversation where we convey a unified and reassuring message is essential, emphasizing that their well-being is\nour top priority.\n- Love and Reassurance- They must know our love for both is steadfast. It's vital to reassure them that we will both persistently be a significant part of\ntheir lives. The essence is that no one is being excluded, and no one is \"voted off the island.\"\n- Avoiding Blame- We must maintain neutrality in our conversation and refrain from attributing blame to the instigator of this process. It’s crucial to\npresent the decision as mutual to mitigate distress, irrespective of the underlying dynamics.\n- Maintaining Consistency- Ensuring some sense of normality in our separation is crucial for their mental well-being now and in the future. We need\nto underscore the consistent elements, like schooling and activities, to foster a sense of stability.\n- Encouraging Feedback- Allowing Max and AD to express their thoughts, fears, and uncertainties is essential. Validating their emotions and ensuring\nthat such feelings are normal, and we are here to support them will be necessary.\n- Honesty and Clarity- While it’s unnecessary to delve into the intricate details of our separation, they have witnessed our fights. So, being honest\nabout the impending changes is essential, and providing the timelines we know will be helpful.\n- Living Arrangements- While we have not finalized long-term living arrangements, we should have a near-term plan if the previously defined\narrangements are satisfactory. Clarifying interim plans and assuring them of our continual presence is critical.\n- Addressing Concerns- Max and AD might initially be reticent but encouraging them to ask questions and providing honest and reassuring responses\nis vital. It’s acceptable to acknowledge uncertainties while demonstrating a united front for them.\nCo-Parenting Guidelines: We must portray a united, loving front for Max, AD, and Elsa to ensure they feel they originate from love, not discord,\nespecially as we navigate through our differences. A collaborative approach will establish a secure environment and reinforce their sense of being\ncherished.\n- Avoiding Conflict- We must refrain from disagreements in the kid's presence to shield them from unnecessary stress and emotional turmoil. Our\nchildren are not instruments in our disputes; maintaining a peaceful environment is paramount.\n- Positive Role Modeling- Demonstrating mutual respect and effective, peaceful communication is crucial. We are tasked with exhibiting behaviors\nthat promote their social and emotional growth. They will look to us to learn how to behave.\n- Prioritizing Their Needs- Ensuring the well-being of our children surpasses any disagreements or conflicts we have is essential. Our commitment to\ntheir needs must be visible and unwavering, transcending our differences.\n- Consistent Messaging- Presenting a united front and avoiding contradictory information will provide stability and prevent potential anxieties and\ntrust issues. Consistency in communication is vital in fostering a secure environment for them.\n- Family Time- Regular, supportive dialogue during this will ease smoother transitions and adjustments to new family dynamics and living situations.\nThe basics provided in the family planning section above should be helpful to this effort.\n- Unified Discipline Approach- Supporting consistency in discipline will fortify trust, ensuring our children perceive our unified values and\npreventing potential manipulative scenarios. Neither of us should be perceived as the \"heavy\" or the \"softie.\"\n- Family Planning: For the mental well-being of our children during our ongoing separation, we acknowledge the importance of maintaining safe and\nrespectful shared family time. Christine and I agree that our interactions during these times will be peaceful, especially in the presence of the children.\nAny discourse must be private.\n\nScheduled Family Dinners- Regularly scheduled family dinners should be arranged to foster stability and create trust for the children's benefit. We\nwill mutually agree upon the dates, ideally incorporating one weekday and one weekend.\n- Event Attendance- Whenever appropriate, we aim to jointly attend events and appointments to show united support for our children, reinforcing\nour shared priorities. This will demonstrate that their needs are the number one priority in our lives.\n- Shared Responsibilities- We will collaboratively manage responsibilities, such as attending appointments and school events, alternately or as agreed\nupon. Due to the chaotic nature of events, ad-hoc arrangements continue to be acceptable.\n- Flexibility and Cooperation- We will strive to accommodate unforeseen circumstances and each other’s schedules to maintain a harmonious co-\nparenting environment and foster a sense of teamwork. I will accommodate Christine's work conflicts.\n- Communication and Advance Notice- Transparent and timely communication is essential. Any information or updates about upcoming events or\nappointments should be shared promptly to allow time for schedule adjustments if desired.\n- Respect for Boundaries and Time- Mutual respect for time and commitments is crucial. If one parent cannot attend an event, the attending parent\nshould share relevant information and updates about the proceedings with the other.\n- Neutral Debriefings- Post-event debriefings should be conducted impartially and factually to ensure parents are informed and aligned on\nsubsequent co-parenting decisions. Let's agree on the format as that is 1-1.\nMessage 2325 of 4024\nI see an email that says more than two weeks after the initial three-week delay, this is not done.\n\"FCS has received a request from the respondents attorney to close the evaluation referral.
