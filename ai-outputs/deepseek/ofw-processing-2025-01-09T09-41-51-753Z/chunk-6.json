And asked you to confirm you were happy with the new private set up.\nIt is approaching midnight. You stopped communicating and I still have no working bed to sleep on and no internet access. You have changed the\npassword and even though I’m listed as the owner now, I can’t get in because of the password change that you made. And they need to know why I\nwant to reverse something you did intentionally with them.\nI told you that you took over my account all afternoon. We have so many mails on it back and forth. You said you were working with fraud and it\nwould be 24-48 hours. I kept asking just to call me so we could tag team like we had successfully all day. I know this stuff. But you still refused.\nI made sure you were totally dialed in. Set up Lugg moves on the fly. You sent junk to my place after we agreed not to do that, sent me a bed that is flat\nso I can’t sleep on it, a TV you know I need the remote for and are the only with access to my WiFi. Sheesh Christine. You are actively monitoring me\nnow (and we know we both know how it works) and sleeping on my bed with me on a couch.\nTbh this is really messed up. Like what do I need to do to get my admin access back from you? I showed you everything today. And got you up and\nrunnjng after you screwed it all up not following simple directions. So you know how it all works now if you paid attention. And now you can see\neverything I do, just like you were complaining about with me.\nThe difference is you have done this willingly, knowingly, and in opposition to my asks. When we shared access that was voluntary on both parts,\nwhether you knew what you were doing or not.\nBut now you know!\nI don’t want to fight. I’ll work with you to get my physical and digital property, IP, and WiFi access back. But like the kids, I’m asking to work\ntogether.

You act like you don't, but your not so stupid not to realize the difference between \"soothing\", which would be just\nkeeping it on the rails vs. doing everything you could, going above and beyond, to show me we were working, we are on the right track. The changes\nmade were being rewarded. You made me happier than I have ever been in my life.\nThe narrative you are trying to rewrite makes you feel better. You self-soothe. Yes, I was an alcoholic, I did fight mean (as we both still do) But\nmarriage is about honesty and transparent communication. THAT IS THE COMMITMENT. You did none of that. You said \"fuck it\" I'm done.\nYou washed your hands clean without so much as a peep that what I was doing was not right.\nYou ruined our marriage with your dishonesty and deception. Period. You can justify it by saying I would not have changed. But you can NEVER\nSAY YOU TRIED. What you did is not what our wedding vows mean. You broke every single one of them, Christine. You owed me the truth, not\nlies and deception. You were my fucking rock. My proudest moment. My queen forever.\nSent:01/20/2024 at 10:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/20/2024 at 10:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress\n\nAnd then you cheated, dumped me, blew up the Moyers, and told our best friends it was me..\nFucking coward\nMessage 593 of 4024\n?\nSent:01/20/2024 at 11:04 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/21/2024 at 08:11 AM)\nSubject:Re: Zero Progress\nAttachments:RPReplay_Final1705546103.mov (42 MB)\nMessage 594 of 4024\nI re-read this.

Why on gods green earth are you, after seven months refusing to talk to the kids? We can do it in a responsible way. I’ve been asking for\nso long. No book on earth or therapist would recommend your unilateral choice. I know, I’ve read them. I’m happy to share, but a lot of it was in the\nparenting plan I sent the first week of September. Let me work with you on this. It’s super unhealthy for the kids to lie and deceive them. They will\nSent:01/22/2024 at 05:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/22/2024 at 09:57 PM)\nSubject:Moving to OFW\n\nlearn you (and maybe me because of this) are totally dishonest and will not be straight with them on the most important thing in their young life.

You blocked me before you even saw my note saying I was moving back here and my thoughts. Did you even see my text to you and Elsa?\nF,  Christine. I did just as you asked and even said I was stopping our texts but you did not even give me the chance to be kind and constructive. Why\ndo you do that? F!!!!

I just don’t get why you are so compelled to behave that way. Christ, Christine.\nCan’t you even for a brief moment allow anything positive in our life? I just don’t get it. Do you hate our children that much?\nSent:01/22/2024 at 10:08 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/23/2024 at 07:58 AM)\nSubject:Well Shit",
