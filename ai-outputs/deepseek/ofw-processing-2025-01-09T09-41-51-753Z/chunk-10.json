And I am begging not educate you.\nThen yesterday Elsa weighed in with her side of the story, but she has never even heard from me. So I don’t know how she has commentary on my\nside of the story if I’ve never even talked to her.\nNot only that, but I never even got to hear what A.D. even said so I can speak to it. That said it turns out that he saw exactly what I saw, but I’ve not\nhad an opportunity to tell him that and explain.\nThen, of course, nobody knows that’I have apologized to you and acknowledged that the cameras were there. And Indefinitely caught an earful for\nnot saying “I’m sorry” when I already had weeks ago.\nSo as I have me mentioned and offered several times today I would like to show you everything. I would like to do that as soon as possible. Right now,\nwe do not have a full accounting of the story.\nCan you please work with me on at least that part? It will go a long way.

We are definitely into late afternoon and rounding the corner to evening pretty soon. Just trying to coordinate myself.\nI also appreciate the conversation earlier. You are asking all the questions. But some of the details are getting mixed up. I am happy to help explain.\nI understand this may be too emotional for you to even entertain however and will respect that as well. I’m just trying to show you what happened,\nwhen.\nAnd to be sure that you know, because I keep saying it but it doesn’t seem to register- I had access, it invaded your privacy, and should’ve informed\nyou\n“Christine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of\nyour personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry”\nI don’t know how to say sorry other than say “I am truly sorry.” I made that clear weeks ago. You wanted it to go through lawyers, so I did that too. I’\nm trying.\nEither way, I promised to work with you constructively after my tone issue, and I assure you that is a promise I will keep.\nSent:02/03/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/03/2024 at 05:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Lugg Tip\nMessage 1018 of 4024\nWe missed each other in flight.
