Nothing else- the children as detailed in\nthe RO.\nYou said conversations about the mental health of AD have to go through Annalisa after you brought them to tears on Thursday. Is Annalisa around?\nAD is. I can't chat with him\nIf this is the process you are mandating to help with my kid's mental health, who is threatening self-harm in your home on your watch, that simply\nwill not work for me.\nI don't get it, but I don't need to. I need to stop you from destroying the childhood and future of Macx and AD. Chart their course so far, roll it\nforward, how does that look ?\nEverything that has happened has been your watch, your plan, your results. And as they progress from happy to bad to life-threatening, nothing ever\nchanges with you.\n\"I am in CHARGE\"- Christine Moyer (all the time)\nSent:05/04/2024 at 04:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 05:20 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\nMessage 2717 of 4024\nSo.. you have read this. I have tried to call again several time and I have been clear that the subject is only the kids but you refuse to talk, explain, or\neven offer a way to discuss our kids health.\nI trying to do this today because Thursday was awful, Friday AD was in horrible shape. And I see him on Sunday. Today is the only day to chat.\nGiven the downward spiral under your roof, it’s a legitimate ask, especially when they are calling me with crying going on, and the fear of God after\nyou terrorized them with awful visions of me.\nThe notion you would demand sole decision power based on 1) your recent judgment and 2) you refuse to chat makes that idea utter nonsense.\nAt this point I will let you know this feels incredibly unsafe to me. You do not seem stable, and it appears you will do anything to keep the status quo.\nGiven that, and what I have seen you are capable of, I interpret your response to be a dare for me to take legal action against you to try to stop this.\nIf there is a more peaceful or constructive way to have a mature discussion, I’m all ears and asking. But at this point you seem dead set on a legal battle.\nShould I think otherwise?\nSent:05/04/2024 at 06:15 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 09:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: The Kids\n\nMessage 2718 of 4024\nnot sure... he is the super hot UK guy\nSent:05/04/2024 at 08:51 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/04/2024 at 09:08 PM)\nSubject:Mark or Marc?\nMessage 2719 of 4024\nThis violates the RO.\nSent:05/05/2024 at 09:37 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 05/05/2024 at 11:22 AM)\nSubject:Re: Mark or Marc? - RO violation\nMessage 2720 of 4024\nYou had a “wheels up, rings off” policy, infamously like airline pilots.

It’s part of the larger narrative\nthat includes you screaming “I’m going to be unfaithful to you” out of the blue for Max’s benefit and making the kids eat with KO. You used verbal\nthreats of infidelity and did things I felt were harmful to our children as a way of manipulating me, but much worse, them.\nDocumenting behavior harmful to the kids feels like a reasonable exercise. You went into great detail about how you felt compelled to tell me about\nMark or Mark because he was a guy you mentored and so incredibly hot.

Not what Max may have said to him. I am\ntired of being in the dark about how you portray me to the kids. It's not fair to anyone.\nLet's be adults, discuss the situation, and figure out how to keep him from our adult situations.

You insisted on villainizing me to\nthe point where our kids were calling me directly and begging me not to do the things you said I had planned this week. Sit back and think about that\nfor a moment- You tell them terrible things about me, they are so scared that Max, who has not called me to chat for six months, felt the urgency to\nplead your case because the two of them were so scared of what you were saying to them.\nIt is astounding you do not see anything wrong with that. I realize I am the only one who does any reading on parenting, especially when it comes to\ndivorce, gifted, and special needs kids, but some of this is just common sense. You don't need \"book learning\" to tell you you should never bring kids\nduring a divorce into our adult situations or use and influence them. It is in every single PP we have ever looked at. This, coming full circle, may be the\nexact reason you always say no to professional guidance. The kids are your pawns.\nWhat is it with you and this kamikaze death mission you are on for you and the kids? We were better than we had ever been in June. Since you have\nour kids on suicide watch. Go be with Kevin; it's honestly fine by me. The kids know him; he knows them. I don't care to make a bigger deal out of it\nnow that there is water under the bridge. You two can have time with Max and Adrian during your turn. But stop destroying their history and\nprojecting your unhealthy behavior on them. Your watch, your plan, your results. Right?\n\"I am in control\" - Christine Moyer, post it notes all over the house.\nP.S. I highly recommend \"Recovery―The Sacred Art: The Twelve Steps as Spiritual Practice\" by Rabbi Rami Shapiro. In a nutshell, it teaches\ngeneral principles about your \"control philosophy\" that can be applied to custody disputes; the advice is to recognize trying to control all outcomes, a\nco-parent, or even the children's feelings and choices can lead to more tension and less genuine cooperation.\nSent:05/05/2024 at 03:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/05/2024 at 06:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Before ADs Game\n\nEmbracing principles like acceptance and understanding and focusing on what we can genuinely influence, like providing a stable and loving\nenvironment for the children, leads to healthier dynamics than an omnipotent \"I am in control.\" approach by one parent. In a more collaborative and\nless adversarial environment where one parent is not laser-focused on the destruction of the other, by any means possible, children can be\nthemselves, make their own decisions, and be generally happier, free from the pressure to conform to an alternate reality that denies where they were\nlast year.\nI don't understand why I have to explain that to you or why your actions last Thursday (or since KO came to light for that matter) are so destructive.\nThis is brain-dead simple stuff.  Don't use kids as pawns. Don't bring Max and Adrian into our divorce as voting participants in our adult situations.\nFor Christ's sake, please just ask Kevin. From what I know, he would even agree.\nMessage 2725 of 4024\nI have communicated to you that our interactions  feel very unsafe on OFW, on OFW calls I take, and in person.\nSent:05/05/2024 at 06:31 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 05/05/2024 at 06:31 PM)\nSubject:Interactions feel unsafe\nMessage 2726 of 4024\nWhen?

I am making it clear, I will have a safe conversation with you under your ground rules. I want you to feel safe first!\nBy contrast, you said the kids have voting right in our divorce. You asked me to get their votes tonight. You told them I am taking you to court and I\nwould take Adrian away. Max even called me. Our children should not be involved in our adult conversations. I know you really believe they should,\nbut you’re wrong.\nIf they had voting rights, we should’ve given them the vote after they had to eat with Kevin. We were doing our absolute best ever and all our history\nwill reflect that. Did they get to vote on whether you should have an inappropriate relationship with a coworker? We know AD hated “wheels up,\nrings off” is that a vote?\nI am asking again after four disastrous days in a row, please let me know what will accommodate a safe space and your feelings so we can discuss the\nkids. I’ll struggle to accept they should make the call for us given the manipulation going on. If you disagree and insist, we need to have a safe\nconversation about it.\nI’m all ears, but I am not prepared to put our divorce in the hands of our kids.

I see and speak with people who have gotten divorced now. A lot of them have wonderful, healthy, satisfying and\neven rewarding relationships with their ex, and the kids love seeing that. It’s healthy for them.\nYou and I will forever be the “unit” of family in Max and Adrian’s minds. They will always affectionately look to us as Mom and Dad. We had some\nbad times but it will never erase the joy we shared together as a family as well. We can’t flush that.\nI’d like to reconsider our relationship and approach all up. Like a fresh start. If we want revenge, let’s do it later in life when the kids are older. Right\nnow we all have too much living to do. We should not waste another day like this. Let’s fix us.\nYou and I moved mountains as a team. We came from the trash can and a one bedroom apartment. We have made miracles happen together. Can we\nsee if we have one final act between us? Can we put our own differences aside and try?\nThe sky is the limit when you believe anything is possible. Let’s consider what could be rather than what was. Let’s look to a brighter future together,\nthat creates an example, not just for Max and AD, but for the whole world to see.\nPressure and intensity turns coal into brilliant diamonds. I think we are ready to start cutting the stone and let a new light shine on the world. Let’s be\nthe couple that separated but everyone admires for their teamwork and bravery.\nIt means we have to be selfless. It means we have to put others ahead of our own agenda.

For example, on the 5th it was in my bedroom and I spaced it. Then I started in the afternoon. But it shows me\ntaking the tests over and over.\nThis was because I ate some keto ice cream. Usually it’s fruit that triggers a positive but after doing some research some foods have sugar alcohol\ninstead of regular sugar, so it pops.\nAnd then it makes you take it over and over till it doesn’t see even the smallest (four decimals) trace detected. And you have to do it at a weird random\nmoment after the last.\nThen like last night, if I forgot till the afternoon, I take one or two even after midnight so you see I’m not stalling till the next day. You just don’t see I\ndid that in the daily report.\nIt’s also very flaky. And sometimes just does not connect. See attached. So then there is that...\nAnyway, if you ever have any questions, just please let me know and I’m happy to explain.

They have been around for a while and said that if you go with Natalie, you are pushing all your\nchips in and going with DV strategy. That is what she does and what she is generally known for. She is a domestic violence domain expert. I assume\nsomeone in your \"Joy Luck Divorce Club\" (Mira, Tomoko, Heather, Chistina, Joyce, who else?) advised you that it was not a lucky Google search.\nThis should not surprise me at all; you have been threatening that for months.

He knew every weekend was date night, he knew we could not keep our hands off each other, and he knew I loved to cook and prepare the\nhouse for you. He knew I would wake Harry early so you could sleep in. He knew that we were, as a family, the best we'd ever been.\nAnd then you blew us up because you had a personal vendetta reignited by your mother because I got drunk five years ago. And you used it as a\njustification to destroy our life. Like you've always said this will be harder on you because I've been thinking about it for a while. And oh my god, was\nit ever, Jesus, you are so dishonest. But I can replace you, and in my mind, I have. Adrian, the guy we called Mini me, can't find a replacement dad no\nmatter how hard you think you can do that. I delivered that boy. He will never get another father. You think this is hard on me. Think about that\npoor kid.\nIn the very best-case scenario, Adrian has been taught nothing in his life is dependable. Down to his father and mother. The absolute pillars of his life.\nI am so ashamed of what has transpired. I am so ashamed of what you have done to this family. There were any number of ways we could have done\nthis without causing lifelong damage to these two children. But you had to prove that your post-it notes were true. You've never been through a\ndivorce. Ive been through several- at this age. You have no idea of the asting damage you have done. And you still won't even recognize it.\nThese kids didn't do this Christine. They don't deserve it. Just as you sat them down, shared the parenting plan, and asked them to vote on our\ndivorce, you pulled them into adult situations beyond their years. So eager to have someone on your side you mentally destroyed our kids to get their\nvotes. Guess what, Christine? Kids don't get a vote. They have a voice, not a vote, and what you have done since you covered up your affair and took\nit out on this family is unforgivable. I'm just wondering at what point in Adrian's life will he stop considering suicide now. Who/what can he ever\ntrust again.\nThe fact that I've got this running mail going back to summer screaming they need help and you've done nothing but disregard every professional\ntherapist that we have seen, along with their advice, in six parenting plans is absolutely maddening. In what world would someone say \"yeah....\nChristine's probably got it right, forget the professionals did some Internet research and worked with her attorney.\" Stop. Please Stop.  I still struggle\nto think that you believe this was the best course of action July 5th, but is impossible to believe you think it is still the best course of action today.\nYour watch, your plan, your results....\nI'd like to know when we can discuss the kids, Christine. Is this the 12th time I have asked in the last two days, both before and after a call to action\nfrom Adrian's school. If you think he is \"thriving\" as you wished, humor me. I want to chat about our kids.\n<<A sampling of my 911 pleas since you and Kevin>>\nPlease see the attached visitation report from Saturday for your consideration. We had a blast and always picked up right where we left off. The only\ndownside was that Adrian really wanted to stay longer and continue our father/son game competition. We were hot and heavy into our usual\nConnect Four faceoff. I'll note AD is not the same kid when Christine is present. He shuts down. He goes silent and exhibits a very stoic demeanor.\nIMHO- he realizes he is a pawn and tries to minimize his role by going \"grey rock\". He does not understand how we went from our \"Dune II\"\novernight to this format. It does not make sense. As I understand, this is all because Christine says AD does not feel safe with me based on Kari's\nfeedback. This might be true, and I am all ears.

He's not just an observer; he's in the heart of this, and it's taking a toll on him. He has said repeatedly that he feels like he\nis in the middle, which is an accurate statement. And gifted children like Adrian can be more susceptible to our parental tension, leading to serious\nissues, like the self-harm he's already expressing. Instead of focusing on our disputes, let’s concentrate on reinforcing positive parenting. Each of us\nshould build him up, provide stability, and show him unconditional love. Let's find a way to co-parent cooperatively, even if we need a mediator or a\n\ncounselor to assist us. We don't have to be friends, but we do need to be partners in parenting. We owe that to him.anded this week. Even saying flat\nout \"no\" to 4 more supervised every two weeks when I asked.  So this is the 911 call AD deserves right now.

I'd like to ask that we revisit your upcoming plans for\nchildcare during your work trip for the sake of Adrian's mental health...I love that guy more than I love myself and have never so much as raised my\nvoice to that child...starting with the premise it will be best for AD to be with his father while you are overseas given the changes I am seeing ... I am\nhoping we don't intensify a situation that increases his anxiety, creates distrust for me or your long-term, and causes problems for him emotionally in\nthe future. May we please entertain a safe dialog on Adrian's best interests?\n- Source: Re: Furnace Tune Up - Jan 31\n...so you are aware, he and I have been having some deep, AD lead conversations- Cabo, Whistler, Hawaii, and Vegas. We have touched them all. He\nwants me to understand its impact on him and know why I did that. Every time we go there, just like when he has asked me to blow, I am very positive\nand reassuring. I thank him sincerely for not turning his back on me and loving me enough to have a difficult conversation that makes him feel\nuncomfortable. It is a true sign of unconditional love. I appreciate it and want him to know I'm an open book.\n- Source: Re: Your Work Trip- Nov 30\nTalking with Max and AD: It’s evident that Max and AD sense that changes are occurring. It’s pivotal that we discuss this matter with them with\nutmost care, empathy, and clarity. A conversation where we convey a unified and reassuring message is essential, emphasizing that their well-being is\nour top priority....Our approach should center on providing reassurance, maintaining transparency, and fostering an open dialogue, addressing their\nconcerns while maintaining a united front to support them through the transitional period.\n- Source: Re: Gorgeous Day: Dad & AD- Nov 2\nCo-Parenting Guidelines: We must portray a united, loving front for Max, AD, and Elsa to ensure they feel they originate from love, not discord,\nespecially as we navigate through our differences. A collaborative approach will establish a secure environment and reinforce their sense of being\ncherished.... By embodying love, consistency, and united values, we create a nurturing environment that prioritizes the well-being of our children,\nfostering a sense of security, love, and adaptive resilience within them.\n- Source: Yurushka Separation and CoParenting v.1.3- Sep 26.\nThis is insanity...\nMessage 2788 of 4024\nI want to have a very short conversation with you 30 seconds. Please quit power tripping and let’s talk about this coparenting decision. Is that simple?\nSent:05/10/2024 at 05:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 05/10/2024 at 07:18 PM)\nSubject:Please pick up",
