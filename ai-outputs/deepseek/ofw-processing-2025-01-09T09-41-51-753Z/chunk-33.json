All other accounts will be frozen, including fidelity with msft stock, retirement accounts, hsa accounts etc,\nso no further stock sales or movement of money out.\nThe amount we receive now will be factored in once we finalize the final asset split.\nThe amount we receive will be used by each of us to pay our own expenses moving forward. You pay your rent, upkeep of rental, insurance, food,\nclothing, etc. Yes I pay for my Botox, and other personal expenses including home mortgage payment, clothing etc\nAt final settlement, we will settle up anything that was paid individually that should have been borne by the other party.\nKid related expenses will be split temporarily 50/50. We will need to align what these are like tuition, camp fees, school related expenses etc. my\nsuggestion is we both deposit an equal agreed upon amount from our split of funds, into the jt BofA bank account, and only use that for kids\nexpenses. Ie monthly tuition payments due starting July. No personal spend from that account or it will need to be reimbursed.\nMy income is my separate income, as is any income you may earn, and will be deposited into our separate accounts.\nI will stop college contributions for the kids and savings into Vanguard until we can align what are contribution should be.\nI believe the cash deposit from your Deferred Comp plan was earned during the marriage, as are your remaining RSUs that are vesting. Those should\nbe preserved until final asset split. I will treat the vesting Sbux RSUs granted during our marriage the same way.

This is therapy. I’m not going to jail for not adhering to therapy. You have disregarded Yurushka, Debbie, Dr. Brown, with zero\nconsequences. Plus we never made Dr Brown’s “talk like it’s with your boss” rules as law. I’m not starting with our fifth therapist and for something\nthat we don’t mutually agree to.\nI hope we can chat and be constructive.
