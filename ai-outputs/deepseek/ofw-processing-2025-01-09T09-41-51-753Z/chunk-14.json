I’d be happy to go for a walk, do teams, or phone call. I know we have things we need to work around,\nbut we could do the Bellevue park circle or a place of your choosing.

He is dying to see the house he chose, furnished. Both the boys are pleasers so he\nwants me to ask you. I think he is concerned about doing something he feels like may disappoint you.\nGiven that he wants it. Dr Brown will not offer an opinion, and there is no harm that will come from it, would you mind asking him like you did for\nthe Alabama game? I trust that you will do it in a way that makes him feel comfortable. I trust you completely.\nGiven zero help from Dr Brown except for her helpful insight for me. That I will take to heart and find healthy moments to explore his concerns, I\nthink we are kind of now at a point where you and I need to decide. And possession is 9/10 of the law.\nSo I’d like to have him over. The alternative is pick some random date in the next few weeks when nothing has changed.

I want to do the right thing and so do you. I am happy to start the list here as asked.\nHere is what the RO says now:\n- The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as\nspecifically permitted, below:\n- The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard\nsolely for the purpose of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding\nmanagement of shared assets.\n- The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in\ncommunications with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or\nmanaging the parties’ shared assets.\nAs I read this, you have no restrictions on communicating with me. The RO just limits how I contact you.

Respectfully, of course, this discussion has been going on for weeks  and I'd like to start an inline\ndiscussion tomorrow. I assure you I am NOT coming off the rails. Last week's ask of me is the way I plan to live my life from now on.\nJust as an FYI below. It should be a pretty simple, straightforward turnaround for Anna Lisa.\nThe language provided in the restraining order (RO) specifically addresses restrictions on the \"Restrained Person\" regarding communication with the\n\"Protected Person.\" The terms of a restraining order are directed at the behavior of the restrained person to protect the safety and well-being of the\nprotected person. It does not impose reciprocal restrictions on the protected person's actions unless specified by the court in a mutual restraining\norder.\nHere’s how the outlined conditions generally apply:\n\nperson. These limitations are in place to prevent unwanted or potentially harmful interactions, while still allowing necessary communication for co-\nparenting or managing shared assets through specified channels.\n\nis consistent with the purpose of a restraining order, which is to protect one party from the actions of another. However, the protected person is\ntypically not prevented from contacting the restrained person unless they also have a restraining order against them or there are specific court orders\nto that effect.\nIf both parties need or want to modify the communication terms of the RO—for example, to allow more flexibility or to impose certain restrictions\non the protected person as well—it's essential to do so through the court. Any changes to the terms of a restraining order must be approved by a judge\nto be legally enforceable.\nIn any situation involving a restraining order, consulting with a legal professional can provide guidance tailored to the specifics of the case, including\nany questions about communication rights and restrictions for both parties.\nSent:02/12/2024 at 02:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/12/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\n\nMessage 1338 of 4024\nTime & Date in screenshot\nSide note... I hope this doesn’t push buttons because it should put you ease. Obviously ADs screen time is more intrusive than the things we had set\nup for us.\nWe had simple things like “joined the network” for anyone (Elsa, Christina, Ms Stephanie... etc) and it never said anyone’s name in the actual alert.\nBUT if you drilled into it you could kinda figure it out by looking at the device name- “Ms. Stephanie’ iPhone” and triangulating on the time it fired.\nThis (when we were a family) was important. You want to know if people are on your family’s network. They can do bad things to work laptops, kids\nstuff, etc...\nWhen I was in the fold, I tried hard to keep us all safe. Just like you file our taxes. We did what we know how to do as in an effort to keep the Moyer’s\nhumming.\nBUT!!! The big takeaway for you, is there were NEVER indoor cams. This hint is enough to infer things. So please know your privacy was NEVER\ninvaded.\nI will swear that’s true on my children’s life, Christine.\nI don’t want to hurt you.

That’s either an sms or mms. This is an iOS alert. Just like with the “you know what”incident. Xfinity brokers that handshake with\nApple.\nIt has nothing to do with ATT. Neither did the other. And it is frustrating. Apple iOS sees a trigger in the cloud and pumps it out to my MAC\naddress.\nStuff happens in the service and even I don’t always grok the trigger. But in both cases, we know what made those fire. We just don’t know how to\nstop it.\nIt’s not going to kill us as long as I don’t go to jail or loose future employability for it.

I could have been more helpful but did not want to ruin a positive conversation with you.\nNow that you have taken the reigns of the Network, however, you see all the stuff I used to see.  It is not intentional, you don't always understand it,\nbut unwelcome alerts pop up on your phone. I know, it happened to me all the freaking time.\nThe good news is that Samsung is likely a TV that was out of Wi-Fi range and conditions changed (a door that is usually closed is left open) or it has\nnot been turned on in a long while (maybe the TV in the man cave?). Then it reconnects, then you get an alert.\nThe good news is to join the network, it had to have a password at some point. And maybe this was just a TV that has not been joined since you\nchanged the WiFI name? That can happen. So it's annoying for sure, but probably safe, and not nefarious.\nSo as mentioned, if you let me know next time, I can teach you how to open an alert, investigate what it is, and have some peace of mind that it should\nbe there. Some android devices are no help, but Samsung usually has the metadata you need.\nAlternatively, perhaps I can screen record simulating the same situation on my phone and share it with you. A picture is worth a thousand words, so a\nvideo is probably worth a book. Divorce is the worst time to have this kind of alert crap happening.\nSent:02/13/2024 at 10:13 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/13/2024 at 12:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Still getting alerts\nMessage 1358 of 4024\nWe are waiting on Anna Lisa.

It is not working. I appreciate the civility we have shared over the last ten days, but the reality is we are not\none task closer to solving anything. And you don't reach out with the smallest olive branch to communicate with me, even with the last\nobstacle cleared by Anna Lisa. I don't anticipate any change. It is an established pattern, and I was misguided to think you might find the time or\nenergy but I am still glad I tried.\nBecause it's not about the RO. Has little to do with emails, texts, or calls. Or the fact that Xfinity spams me with alerts even after you took\nresponsibility a month ago. It's not about you attesting that I have and will beat you to the police. Or that you have five registered audio/video devices\nthat can drop in on my most private moments going back to my beach days. Or even Dr Brown's crazy misguided off-target effort that includes no\nreunification agenda. It is about the barriers.\nSee, those are just bumps in the road. Hindrances to the singular thing that matters. And that is if you believe our boys are better off without me. You\nhave wiped me, and our memories from the house. I assume you would format their brains if you could. And if by whatever means possible, believe\nthey should have me separated from their existence all altogether. This, all after the best spring and summer we could ever have had together.\nYou are omnipotent in this system and your actions demonstrate that eliminating a strong, sober, father figure is your desire. It is not a priority for our\nboys to have a biological father as a role model or a positive force in their lives, teaching them lessons learned and passing on wisdom from my failures.\nAfter banishing all positive memories perhaps, you will replace me soon. And with each passing day, it becomes their new narrative, engrained more\ndeeply,\nI acknowledge the challenges I have introduced into our lives, and I understand the expectation was for me to have navigated my childhood based on\nan innate moral compass and not pass anything I learned along. But now the question comes down to redemption and healing. And is that something\nwe should foster in these young men? Will it serve them better to face the past, do the work, and heal or should they continue down the path of\nalienation and punishment?\nYour stance suggests a preference for moving on without addressing the potential for reconciliation and growth. But this overlooks the essence of my\nattempts to communicate and reintegrate into our sons' lives, aiming to contribute positively to their development into resilient and capable\nindividuals. You may see it just as \"robert wants to text or call... no way\" but it misses the point. I'm trying to knock down obstacles that keep us from\naddressing the issues.\nSo as another day passes, you sign on for five minutes, spraying a couple of responses before going dark for the next five hours, only to rinse and repeat\ntwice more before you shut down, I urge you to reflect on the deeper reasons behind my persistence. I am striving to dismantle the barriers preventing\nour sons' healing.
