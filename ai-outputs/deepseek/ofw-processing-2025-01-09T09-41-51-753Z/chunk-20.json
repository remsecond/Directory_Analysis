This is not about you and me trying to figure out anything that we need\nto be more constructive and peaceful. This is about reunification. So, I assume Max and I, only now you and I can never talk or be in the same space\nagain, which may be fine, too. So, no basketball, robotics, Kerri Betts, SAAS emails or conference calls, no anything - period. Everything has to end,\nfull stop.\n\"Dr. Benjamin’s job is to help you improve communication between your child and you.\"\n\"If an e-mail is sent to the CoParent Psychotherapist and copied to the other parent, do not answer it before the CoParent Psychotherapist is able to\nrespond, first.\"\n\"Once, the treatment phase begins, for each email reviewed, you will be charged $5. Any email requiring a response from Dr. Benjamin will be charge\nat $20 per response.\nBased on what is stipulated, NO email can be answered w/o him responding. That's $25 a pop.\nYour RO is pointless. This whole time I have been working to at least have some modicum of communication so we could do the things like we did\nwith Dr Brown, Kerri Betts, Basketball and Robotics, and most importantly getting Adrian into SAAS. That all goes away. We do nothing now.\nWe went from plans of nesting and the Alyssa model to this. Do you really believe this was all my fault? It all rests on me. Even as you said, you are in\ntotal control, doing what you think is best. I tried so hard to extend an olive branch, and you are never ready. You won't make any effort whatsoever,\nso now we have to be treated like toddlers and charged $25 an email.\nYou promised to consider my proposal to just stop and find something neutral to do to build something back. Today you said you would not\nconsider that any longer. You said today you would make time to discuss before the end of the week. It will be the last time we talk and I have no\nreason to believe you will make good on that promise either.\n- Yes, it is all your way. It is what you think is best?\n- This is really how you wanted this to go for us?\n- This is what you think the kids want to see from us?\nWe will hate each other's fucking guts till the wet sod is laid over our cold dead bodies. Such a waste of 3 decades and 3 kids. I ask you every few days\nsince you say it is your way or the highway... How is your way going?

I think we have a few topics. Glad it does not have to be separate emails!\n- AD and Dad: I chatted with him earlier this AM. He is playing the new fortnight now so we agreed I would grab him around lunch.\n- SAAS: We are good to go. I'll keep you in the loop with any updates I get. I have talked to AD. We will get his charger back on Monday.\n- RO: Annalisa keeps sending the version that has \"physical violence.\" Should we update and send it to her instead to stop the confusion?\n- Parenting Plan: If I can get this to you and Annalisa today, can you guys formally approve it today so we can knock that out?\n- Sonos: I think they should all be down and ready for handoff now. What is going to work best for you so I can keep that moving?\n- Andy: As mentioned, I'm all in as you confirmed we would follow the Plan and RO. If you let him know that, we can start today.\nYikes! Six important topics in one exchange. I am extra appreciative of your cooperation and flexibility this week as this is still so hard. But we have are\nmaking progress. Teamwork !\n--------------------------- Andy Rules Exercise---------------------------\nJust for fun I did the calc on our Andy discussion.
