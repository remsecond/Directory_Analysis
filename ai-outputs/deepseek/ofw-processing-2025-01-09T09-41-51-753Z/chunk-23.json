Opinion shop all you like, but it’s still ongoing mental abuse.\nYour story and justification for child abuse has twisted and evolved since July. Booze, mushrooms (you did), DV, multiple accusations of monitoring\n(8?). This is all while you maintain drop in functionality on me, and persist in sending me alerts on what’s happening on your network that I have\nasked you to stop for months to falsely say I’m monitoring you. You won’t stop.\nThat is pretty much the totality of what happened unless you want to dig deeper on the incident that triggered your change of tune from the “Alyssa\nmodel” to “Sherman’s March to the Sea”. So as you and your child focused attorney focus on a solution that stops the child abuse you continue to\njustify I’m not confident in your ability to make sound decisions.\nThey say “3rd times the charm”, right? Well this will be the 7th time. And that’s if your higher wisdom is accepted as canon law with zero negotiation\nback with a parent that has the same legal rights you have. May I suggest you pause your child abuse until you come down from the mount with the\nstone tablets from god? Or google searches and your lawyer.\nYou realize this could never be a movie. People would walk out after the third try because the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th would seem so abusive to the\nkids and implausible in real life it would be a waste of time to sit through. Unfortunately our kids are not only sitting through it, they are living it.

I hope we will again someday.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 10:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:50 AM)\nSubject:AD Purchase...\nAttachments:IMG_2209.PNG (368 KB)\nMessage 2284 of 4024\nHere is why I thought it was ICS. If we have a SAAS opportunity soon, we should put on our big boy pants and go together. They helped us in a real\ntime of need. We don’t need to pay a lot of money, but we should at least be present imho.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 10:57 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Auction Tonight\nAttachments:IMG_2210.PNG (608 KB)\n\nMessage 2285 of 4024\nCan we just make time w/o the kids around, tomorrow. The last opportunity you really gave me to chat was months ago when I wanted to salvage our\nmarriage. I’m over that. It does not taint my perspective anymore.\nWhen I heard you today I had serious heartfelt feelings for the woman who I have know for 30 years, gave me three wonderful kids, showed me love\nbetter than I ever deserved, and should not spend another moment with this hate.\nPlease, I’ve asked for months. We don’t need to go couch shopping or glass blowing, but we have to find a way to simply find the humanity in each\nother again. Nothing grander than that. Just recognize each other civilly and respectfully.\nMay we sit together tomorrow? Quietly if need be. We can start with silence and work our way up to kind and constructive questions. You and I can\naccomplish anything in this world we put our mind to. Let’s start with being decent to one another.\nSent:03/23/2024 at 11:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nMessage 2286 of 4024\nWill this help?\nSent:03/23/2024 at 11:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nAttachments:IMG_2211.PNG (8 MB)\nMessage 2287 of 4024\nYes I did.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD Purchase...\nMessage 2288 of 4024\nI could be mistaken.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 07:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Auction Tonight\nMessage 2289 of 4024\nI am unable to do that given where I am emotionally and mentally with you.

I was trying to reach out and be kind.In return, may I ask that when we are in front of the kids you stop screaming at me.\nYesterday, like you always did when I was in Bellevue on the Adrian drop offs, you started screaming at me yesterday in front of Max.\nWith Adrian, you would get out of the car and start yelling at me despite Dr. Brown’s advice that that should never happen with him there.\nYesterday, you demanded therapist names. I said I would speak to Lisa so you pointed your finger and started screaming “we are at war.”\nThis was with Max, right after a therapy session to check in on how he is doing. In my opinion this causes extreme parental alienation and damage.\nI will no longer request you to be peaceful, civil, or constructive given your request. I will however ask you to stop these outbursts in front of our kids.\nThanks for your consideration in the best interest of their mental health.\n-robert\nSent:03/24/2024 at 08:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 09:36 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion\nMessage 2292 of 4024\nDocumenting what you are saying below is a false narrative.\nJust because you say it does not mean it to be true.\nI have asked on multiple occasions not for us to talk anytime. You refuse and continuing demand I do so and even come and insist to sit next to me or\nwill find me and insist you stand next to me.\nIt makes me feel emotional and physically unsafe.\nYou will follow me to the car despite my protests and repeatedly request/demand I meet you or discuss a topic. This is often followed up by an e-mail\nrequesting the same which is documented.\nI say NO repeatedly.\nDO NOT SIT NEXT TO ME, FOLLOW ME TO THE CAR, ASK ME TO TALK at any of the events.\nSent:03/24/2024 at 09:43 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/24/2024 at 09:43 AM)\nSubject:Re: Post Therapy Discussion",
