Ever...\nPer the attached, you and Anna Lisa are saying:\n- There is a Serious Concern for Safety: The court believes that there is a legitimate and convincing reason to be concerned for the safety of the\nprotected person. This is not a speculative or unfounded fear; it's based on credible evidence of similar incidents.\n- Physical Safety at Risk: The focus of this statement is on the physical safety of the protected persons. It demonstrates that the court has a real and\ndemonstrated reason to believe the restrained person will cause physical harm to the persons ordered to be protected.\n- Justification for Restraining Order: This finding is the key factor in the court's decision to issue the restraining order. It justifies the need for legal\nprotection because there is a clear and demonstrated pattern and history of physical abuse from the target of the order.\n- Increased Vigilance and Enforcement: With such a clause in place, law enforcement and the court are likely to be more vigilant in enforcing the\norder. Violations will be treated with greater seriousness given the perceived risk to physical health and safety of the protected.\n- Potential Impact on Other Provisions: This clause will influence other aspects of the restraining order, such as restrictions on proximity,\ncommunication restrictions, and other specific behaviors. The proven threat of bodily harm makes the request highly credible.\n- It's important the restrained person and the protected person understand the very serious implications of this clause. The restrained person must be\naware of the seriousness of the situation and the need to strictly adhere to the terms of the order to avoid legal consequences.\n- The protected person should understand they are asking for this level of risk mitigation and can demonstrate a history of this behavior so the court\ncan take all necessary precautions for the physical safety of those being protected given its likelihood of happening again.\nMessage 813 of 4024\nJust to reiterate, I am not trying to physically threaten you or the kids in any way as noted in the RO or with this communication. If you feel quoting\nthe RO you sent, along with the associated research, is a threat, please let me know immediately.\nIf so, I promise to address your concerns immediately with my attorney and the court to reassure you, the kids, and the court that I am not\nthreatening physical or sexual violence now, or ever. Even if you think it is likely to happen in the future.\nYou just asked me to \"Show me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers.\" So, I'm trying to accommodate my\ninterpretation of your ask, understanding you did this with your lawyer with a clear intent and purpose.\nI will never physically or sexually abuse you or my children. If asked to sign something implying, I have and am likely to do it again, to keep you from\npursuing much more serious courses of action against me, I am just registering my concerns.\n-robert\nSent:01/26/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Will I beat you fork>>\nMessage 814 of 4024\nThank you for the update and explanation.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 10:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:34 AM)\nSubject:Re: SoberLink\n\nMessage 815 of 4024\nI have a lot of questions and concerns about some of the content below and the moves I am making that you may not be aware of.

His claims are very accurate, as many\nmodern devices and services do have the capability to monitor and log various types of usage data.\nHere's a breakdown of the key points mentioned in the message:\n\nnetwork like Xfinity, can indeed transmit signals indicating their usage. For example, a smart bed might record when it's being used, and a Wi-Fi-\nconnected picture frame could log when new photos are viewed.\n\nhave records of calls and texts (including the time and the number contacted), as well as data usage details for streaming and internet browsing.\n\nproviding notifications or logs of activity. For example, a smart home system might log when lights are turned on or off, or when a door is opened or\nclosed.\n\nfor instance, records voice commands, and cameras can log when they detect motion or are accessed.\n\nvisited websites, and even the tracking of location (such as when someone leaves or arrives home) is possible with the right setup and permissions.\n\nnetwork or devices are configured to track this information.\nAll these capabilities exist, and it's important to note that accessing and interpreting this data often requires specific permissions and sometimes\ntechnical know-how. In a family setting, monitoring is viewed as a safety measure, but it's crucial to balance safety with privacy and trust. The\nperception of such monitoring as either protective or invasive can vary greatly depending on the context and the individuals involved.\nIn conclusion, all the technical aspects of your dad's message are accurate, but whether this constitutes 'spying' or 'protection' can be subjective and\ndepends on whether this was initially set up for family safety and convenience or implemented as a way to surveil. Remember these services are offered\nto protect families, not spy.",
