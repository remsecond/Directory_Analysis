Yes, that is what we said. Let's try 9:00 if that works for pick-up.
Are we going to discuss settings here and expectations? Or did you do all of that? Who else has access to this? We should probably both align on what
you did, agree?

You ignored my question about discussing the settings and how this is used both here and in text. And I don’t know what to expect wrt response
time. I have zero info on this all or the way you set it up. When you want to discuss we can move back to it. Till then, I’m out! Thanks!

Please refer to Dr Brown communication guidelines and response timelines and expectations. I did not adjust any settings.
I am not going to revert to a communication method that has proven volatile for you.
If you refuse to use this service, please suggest an alternative. This was the service your lawyer suggested as well and you signed up for in September.

That’s a pretty toxic response. All I asked was the info you just provided. That seems easy. But you choose to ignore it in two places and then go to
blast. In the future it might be easier just to answear a simple question than to start making assumptions and making demands.
Any chance we can actually agree to read each other’s question and see if we can just answer it first next time? I think that was Dr Browns suggestion
today as well. Behaving the exact same way, just on another platform won’t really buy us much. Let’s make this work together!
Thanks!

We have put our discussion off for quite a while now. Including our running list. You pushed it till after yesterday so let me know when you want to
have it.
It won’t be f2f and we should both be in a space we can be kind and willing to show grace. We finally have something in place so hope that helps us

Ok. I honestly feel like anything, no matter what that I suggest, that will show the kids something positive, is always a hard no. No matter what.
Do you ever have plans to show any conflict resolution and civility? I am really hoping we work back to the Alyssa model someday.
But I’m honestly concerned you have cast me as such an irredeemable villain to everyone that you can’t show anything else and save face.
I guess we should be honest if we even share goals of healing and civility or if we are always going to be hateful and demeaning to each other.
And I’m not at all looking to debate it on Xmas eve. I’m just looking for a truthful answer because if it takes time, fine. But “never” is not healthy.

And I updated you every step of the way to be sure we were still on the same page. Since we swap I’ll take a stab at the odd year.
Christine:
- All of December break
- Luxury trip to Cali and Universal Studios
- Christmas Eve with Rudolph’s
- Xmas morning with never noted gifts
Robert:
- Encore Xmas morning
I’ll figure out to ask “just the right question” someday. Because I clearly noted that the kids Xmas should start much earlier. That is important to
them. I’m their Dad, I know that. So I’m glad that you could swoop in and do it for them at least. I’ll be ready for Act II.

that.
The platform won’t matter if you are always dishonest. They say lying is hard because you always have to remember what you said. You can make it
easier on both of us by being honest. Then there are zero messages to try and figure out the truth. Can we just start there and see how it goes?

We agree. I think we need to dial it WAY back.
Hopefully it was just because there was so much planning and details we did not think about. I think it will behoove us to really be sure we include as
much needed info in the first back and forth, rather than a death by a 1k cuts, fine tuning later.
We have the right tool, let’s learn how to use it right and use it to our mutual advantage. I’m also learning more about things like the “tone meter” and
scheduling. I’ll share in one go instead of piecemeal as I was tempted to do initially.
If there is an emergency I’ll text you. Otherwise I don’t plan to be pinging you here during my time. Thanks!

You are suggesting to bring him back to the Kirkland home with no time stated and that you need packages that I do not see. You saw my message and
chose not to respond.
Dr. Brown suggested no pick ups and drop off at residences. You are located in an apartment tower so there is not a threat of me entering your
residence. You are stating you will come directly to the house which I do not agree to.
I will move this to lawyers as this is not working and you are not following Dr. Brown guidelines

I will not replying to this point by point. When I do, it seems to always make the matter worse. We have different perspectives and I do not wish to
inflame either our relationship or this situation. And I certainly don’t want a repeat of what just transpired.
We had a plan. It worked yesterday and came off the rails during pick up. We honestly don’t need to argue or expose the children to adult situations.
Maybe thats where we start? But I think it’s about getting back to the way we worked together yesterday.
We will chat later before 1:00 as agreed. So let me know when. My humble suggestion is that you let me know what you want and expect to make this
a healthy relationship for the kids. And even us. We need tools in our box more than ever before.
I promise to bring a healthy, optimistic, can do attitude to our discussion. I also assure you that nothing that happened in the past will be used as
material- no retribution. I only want to sincerely and calmly discuss moving forward. Golden Rule!

Yes... did you see the other thread? I want to be sure if we communicate it’s civil and productive. I’m not trying to control you. I am only asking that
we start any communication without disagreeing or arguing about things that are in the past. Where we both have a lot of hurt. That is better left for
the therapy that Dr Brown recommended. Not amateurs like us.

We had a great discussion today. We made a great plan. Let’s stick with it even if it hit a speed bump. Let’s not talk about the past (that includes
today). Let’s put this behind us and do the best we can by the kids and each other. The golden rule- do unto others, even if it means starting this

After thinking about this more, I realize that you were

about swinging his Xbox over. You were not there.
I get our history might have lead to a conflict. But, we have a plan now. Me micromanaging what you do with your time is not permitted. I can
sympathize with why you would think I would complain, but I assure you that I am not going to do that. It is your time.
If I give you grief moving forward, please let me know immediately. I will course correct. I honestly was only bothered that you were not being

him an unbudgeted $650 unless we want him to learn a hard lesson.
Either way you might say something to him and say we will let it slide this time but it’s a costly goof. I’ll see if I can use it for something creative so it’s

1 Dialectical Behavioral Therapy program
- Christine will participate for at least 6 months
- Robert will participate for 12 months
Resources: Eastside DBT, Thira, EBT Seattle, and the Seattle Clinic are good options.
Notes: We can talk about if we do it at the same place. Does not need to be same person.
2 Marriage counseling
- Christine and Robert- Not to stay together, but to peacefully coexist for the kid's sake.
Resources: We can consider Debbie or someone else.
Notes: Important to get the details from Dr Brown. Let's discuss how to do that.
3 Child Therapy
- Max and Adrian should go to this as soon as possible. Therapist should have the final parenting plan.
Resources: Kari Betts is who I have reached out to or someone else.
Notes: Let's decide if we want to go with her.
4 Substance Use Counseling
- Christine should be allowed a session with a substance use professional
- Robert goes once per week with a provider who specializes in working with addiction
Resources: New Life or perhaps one of the places where we do DBT since they coexist so often
Notes: Robert to investigate and talk to Christine
5 Child Led Reunification Therapy
- Robert, Max and Adrian
Resources: None suggested
Notes: Perhaps we ask Dr Brown or Kari Betts for recommendations.

Boys spring break is aligned this year. The room is booked for April 6 - 13.

how do boys feel safe in a foreign country with no ability to escape, if your anger, or sobriety where to relapse.

I’ll review Dr. Brown guidelines but she had expected response time in there. It feels like you are tracking when I read the emails and then expecting an

I was thinking about not being able to shoot for an hour while you were at work tomorrow. And I realize during the school year, that’s the schedule.
So no issues. It’s your time.
Then our plan says: “Spring Break and Winter Break should be alternated via even and odd years so that each parent has one of the breaks every year.”
We are on winter break.
Then for the actual holiday event we rotate Eve vs. Day. But given the plan, it seems I am getting the school allotted days while they are on break. Is
that intentional?
TBH- spring and winter are nowhere near the same (I think) so not sure the plan really accounts for our real world. And next winter I don’t really
expect two full weeks - Xmas day.
It just seems ill conceived and we are making up some weird hybrid. Most importantly - I AM NOT bitching. This is not a knock. You have been very
helpful. But it’s not the plan, right?
Please, please, don’t take it as fighting or snarky. Just tell me I’m wrong if you think I am. But the first pass through the calendar is going to be a
learning experience for us.
Thank you!

I’ve been thinking about this more and have some ideas of how we might do this. It will require you to help and even some teamwork, but if you

I’d like to share them with you tomorrow and hope you will approach with an open mind with a goal of getting the entire family a bit more “re-
unified” since the events of July 5th.
This has been a real struggle and has only gotten worse, but given we know we are getting a divorce and will lead separate lives, I hope we can do right
be the kids and each other and take a healthy approach once the parenting plan is in place.

Lots of staring at the ceiling last night.
I am admittedly scared of our conversation this AM and assume you have some concerns as well. I am
admitting I am powerless and am praying to my higher power to show me the way to have a peaceful and constructive conversation this morning,
being thoughtful with my actions and words, and treating you with the respect and dignity you deserve.
This, while I ask for grace, cooperation, and maybe even some measure of forgiveness that should not be afforded to me. I pray that we find a way for
that being clear eyed that forgiveness does not mean forgetting. And in our case, it specifically means that destructive words and deeds are never
appropriate, normalized, or permitted again.
I promise I will try and do my best by you and the family as we have a difficult conversation in an effort to start a long healing process and
reunification together. I pray my thoughts and words are guided with best intentions rather than self service, in the best interest of all. I wish you the
best and that your higher power guides you in the way that is right and appropriate for you as well.

We are aligned on phase 1 so no need to accelerate discussions. Frankly I agree with Dr Brown and we cease verbal communication and we need to
adjust communication on this platform as well.
The three emails you sent clearly escalate in tone and none require immediate response.
I’ll confer with my lawyer on Tuesday on suggestions for modifications but this clearly is not working and does not prevent you from behavior that is

————————————————————————
Christine-
Please take a look at the attachment. If we have agreed on Phase I, that is great. Let's go ahead and move forward. I have updated the doc with "track
changes" turned on.
Obviously, we are not at all in agreement for Phase II. Specifically, if the best I can even do is 65/35 for AD with zero guaranteed for Max. And
unnecessary disruption for them.
I also never get a real vacation in your plan, as it has to be within Uber distance. Spring Break will give you Hong Kong, California Theme Parks, and
Cabo all in a row with Mom.
Perhaps the easiest way to review is to start by accepting changes, looking at the way it reads to assure you are OK with the suggested updates, and
seeing notes on the side.
I'm looking forward to your feedback so we can send the areas of disagreement to Dr. Brown. She can provide suggestions for mutually disappointing
tiebreaks, and we move forward.

You always have an excuse. For everything. If you can’t make time to have a talk about our child given the way he has responded to this situation
forget it. If you really don’t see a problem here that we urgently need professional help with I don’t know what to do.
Your way has not worked since Yurushaka when we promised to talk about discernment. Please recognize history for a moment and consider if we
have a problem we should address constructively. We used to work together even after this started. It worked.
Then you started shutting down our efforts. Stopping any help to understand the other’s perspective, or heal. Creating a destructive self fulfilling
prophecy of disaster. It’s not working. It’s getting worse. Please consider working with me before the courts make us.
Today this all started when I tried to do you a favor. Then another. Then you insult me and start a fight. I’m sure I do that crap as well to you. But we
should learn how to step back, own our own self-determination. And stop. But we really need help to do that.
I was dark all weekend so this would not happen. But we will have to talk sometime. Like we should for Max’s mental health. This is a very high stakes
game. Let’s please treat it with the care and respect it deserves. So we can talk about our kids mental health.

- we have heard different things each time
- we choose the one that we each want to hear
- none of it is working and we are ignoring that
So what is the definition of insanity?
Why are you fighting against trying to learn to work together? Really? Is it for appearances to someone else? Is it pride? It’s not working. It’s our kids

Thank you again for the flexibility. AD and I are having a blast. You said you had to change plans and I want
to acknowledge your kindness. I promise to return the favor and appreciate you leading by example.
The game is SUPER slow. So many freaking commercials. It’s worse than the superbowl it seems. Either way, UW starts at 5:45. But as soon as this is
done I’ll get him over to the party for act II!

Hi Robert,
I’d like to discuss Adrian’s school situation and his ongoing unhappiness at ICS. We have had conversations over the past few months in regards to his
experience and I am increasingly concerned for what he expresses to me.
Options
1) See if he can transfer to SAAS this school year
2) Apply to SAAS for grade 7
3) transfer him to Kirkland Middle school this school year or for grade 7.
It is clear to me ICS is not a good fit and am worried the longer he stays in that system, the more frustrated he becomes.
Option 1 and 2 are certainly pricey but I’d like to seriously consider it. I was going to bring it up once there was more certainty on the job front on
your end, but after a conversation we had tonight I don’t believe I can wait any longer.
Let me know a good time to connect on this, this week.
Thank you
Christine

I am concerned that introducing a new school when he has no idea even what his own parents are doing, might be a tricky time. The poor dude has no
safe harbor in the storm anymore.
Please don't take any of this as a knock on you. I'm just very concerned for him these days.

Christine, it’s kind of an issue for me. I think in our parenting plan it discusses undermining each other. And that includes too friends of our child’s
parents. Specifically in this case, you lied to me and you told me that you had not told our deepest and dearest friends of 16 years. But I found out
when they texted me about how I was doing. You always lie about anything that you want but then have a clever excuse that it’s all justified. So when
you are violating the terms of our parenting plan, undermining me as it stipulates not to, and lying about it, that becomes an issue for me.

I do not want to argue with you. We had a plan to nest. Period. That was our plan of record. You decided that Yurushka’s label was appropriate and I
won’t argue that point or the change in perspective.
But prior to that, whatever we had then, it was ok to nest. But you have changed your mind. That is fine. But I understand our history, it’s and our
evolution so to me it’s still confusing. But I accept that.
Yes. Divorce is expensive. I hope we can get a handle on our relationship well enough to work collaboratively together. I want to partner with you so
please let me know how to do you feel safe.

I do not. I agree. And I don’t agree that I asked you to hide anything. If our relationship was not normal for 29 years, I would have expected a
conversation.
But I don’t want to fight. Period. I’d like to understand it better as we had planned to do, but am willing to wait on your timeline. That’s most
important now.
Just because you decide to change your perspective, did not mean I stopped wanting to improve and be the best husband and father I could be to us.

I recognize that the other thread has some triggering language and topics. I want to be sensitive to that. You have made a request of me of what not to

I am happy to explore spaces like that under the watchful eye of a professional and welcome that. But till then I’d like to steer clear and be respectful
of things that might give you anxiety or cause you to feel triggered. I’m trying here. 
You are working. I realize this is the exact kind of thing we are trying to avoid, so am not looking for anything else from you so you can focus and be

Please do. I’m trying to figure out what he is exposed to for his own mental health. DV was never in our vocabulary at 47 and 56 unless I was cooking
sausages for the ladies breakfast.
Then Yurushka introduced the label it and it has driven almost everything in our life for the last six months. Why would he be asking about that? It’s
adult business he shouldn’t be exposed to.

Both kids were witness to it Robert during their entire lives.
To be exact about when I know for certain Adrian heard the term is below on Wednesday September 13. I have contemporaneous notes from that
day. You left for Oregon for our safety. Below is a recap.
I tried to leave the home in the car as you were acting unsafe and irrational and snatched my phone away from me. More details can be provided if
needed. As you were blocking me from leaving the house from the car, Adrian came and started using his safe word with me. What followed is I
escaped from you and left  through the front door. You chased me out of the house and started yelling “you are a domestic violence abuser” loudly.
That is when Lisa drove by in her car and removed me from the situation. I texted the kids to meet me at her place.

I said that he said “DV” . He did not translate what you believe happened to the two letter acronym. Which even in your story does not note. How

The larger point is, and I’m tired of fighting with you as you justify your destruction and smear campaign (including with the parents of our kids
friends l) on me. You are doing it and are dishonest about it.
It’s simply not in the kids interest to portray me as a monster to them or to our long long time friends. We have a plan. Let’s stop the character
assassination and recognize it’s better for our kids mental health.
I’m not going to argue with you here today. I want to start doing right by the kids. I always build you up to them. I want them to look up to, respect,

I am hoping that in cases where you are itching for a fight, but still wait till the next day to unleash, that we can just put that hate on ice instead of
ruining another day straight from the get go. It’s a new day.
Now we will have all day trying to grapple with the crap we could have dealt with before bed but decided to kick off the day with. My suspicion is

It was probably one of the best ever, tbh. Really an awesome day. AD is just amazing. And I really love coaching his team. I’m in my element. For that
matter, I’ve turned a corner I think. I look great, feel great, and we have a parenting plan so all my big problems are solved.
That said, I did miss your voice on this special day for the first time in 29 years. Even when we talked late at night from River Oaks Parkway to
Seymour Road. There will be a lot of firsts in our ending. That’s fine. But tbh, I still love some part of you. I don’t feel bad about it either.
And you say I don’t have that kind of access to you, so that is fine. But when I pledged to love you till death do us part, I meant it. And I still do. And
even though you hate everything about me, I know in my heart I never held malice for you. I learned wrong. Not an excuse, a reality.
I’m not asking you for anything. And I’m entitled to my own feelings and my own reality. It’s me that we
are talking about after all. And I know more about the how, why, and intent of my actions than anyone, even you. So I’m ok telling you I know my
truth. And we can both be right.
Hope when things get better I can have a rain check on my bday dinner. It would be nice to break bread with an old friend who I shared so many of
these days with in the past. Till then, I’ll do my best with this new opportunity and move the hell on with my life. Unexplained as it is.

not involved, but I asked you to be involved. I am doing that again. Would you like to be involved?
Message 260 of 4024
You are sending me blackmailing texts.
You signed a lease yesterday for 6.800 without consultation and communicated it’s all community property and within your rights to commit me to a
spend for my half without my input.
Threatening me that you will make unilateral decisions because I will not respond to your blackmail threatening texts is your choice.
I do not plan to respond to any more emails, texts, calls or this platform as I feel threatened.

As I have mentioned many times before. On several platforms now, I’d like your feedback on a 9 or 12 month lease. I am asking you directly again,
just like I have been for days. I’m not trying to fight you.
And I am not escalating. I am also not addressing what you are saying below. I don’t believe that to be true but you’re free to say what you want.
Do you want to be involved in the term of the lease decision or not?

Ok... fyi I was able to talk him into 9 months with month to month after. I’d like 12, I’m so tired

I’m really trying, Christine, I’m just done waiting. On a place to live, getting my stuff, getting a parenting plan for our kids. everything that allows me
to move on. Everywhere you’re blocking me from doing it.
And while I sympathize that you ALWAYS say you have no time, but make time for new relationships while your kids don’t even know about the
divorce and I’m totally blocked, my sympathy runs thin.
You have made zero effort for the kids therapy, or the the work we are supposed to be doing. It’s awesome you’re putting yourself first, but please
start making some time to clean up the wreckage you are creating.
Forget about me. You hate me.

ACK on AD, thank you. I’ll do my best and communicate with him.
I have LUGGs lined up for this week Mon-Wed to start uncoupling. My plan is to move consistent with our shared email.
There may still some fine tuning (example: I think Max uses the stair master to train)  but I’ll stick to the confirmed items. It will likely be a couple of
weeks to complete but it’s a start.
I hope that you are pleased I negotiated a 9 month lease. Very few places will do that but I made it clear that was the reason this place was even in
consideration.
So while it may bother you, I am tried my best and it’s a competitive rent in this market. And it’s near you, a SAAS bustop, and the kids should
approve of the space.
I’d also like to make some purchase descriptions today. (Example: ScanPan, Linens, Towels, organizing stuff- Kitchen and closet, etc...) I think we
agreed for some of these we both need a refresh. In other cases we can either split, or purchase new and have two separate sets. I am happy and would
prefer collaboration.
I am trying to work constructively with you to extricate myself from any area of your life that is not necessary. Every cross word about who is doing
what on a Eastside place is likely washed breath. It will be resolved by someone else in the future. So let’s just start trying to work together in a positive
way with a shared goal.
Please do reply. It’s so hard to communicate sometimes and you have called it out as well. I’m not debating the platforms right now. I’m talking about
this message and this topic on OFW.

I may try and change the Wednesday LUGG to be a bigger truck so we can reduce trips. But sharing what I have booked now.
We will probably swap some stuff (mattresses,
living room set for study?) And neither of us want the table and chairs.
But that can wait for a v.next plans discussion. I think the goal right now should be to get to a reasonable and functional state.

Yes, makes sense. No need to set up a couch move.

I’ll spend some time mapping out all the details as I understand. And the logistics to tonight. Then we can go over it together. Then we can decide if
we want to fill holes with CL or Fernish or whatever we find.
Then we can say “let’s both budget $ for mutual xyz and stay in each other’s ball park. Example: Sitting Room- Mine will double as an office. But I’m
not going to dupe yours now. That would be nuts.
Or... if we see something we love and must have that is beyond a shared budget, then perhaps we tell each other and say “ok, get whatever you want,
but it’s your 50/50 later”. But that is earmarked as a spend.
I don’t think either of us would do that without knowing if the next 20 years we are both living in  separate but duplicate lives in our own 1.3k square
foot apartment. But we may. This is tough for sure.

<<I sent this to you in October. It is my understanding of the current situation. But I’m not a lawyer. It was also a plea to work together so we made
smart fiscal decisions for the long term. My offer still stands>>
Hey-
I was thinking about what you said about us drawing down your assets since you make more money than I do now even though we continue to pull
from Fidelity the same way we always did to cover the gaps.
Hypothetically Speaking:
- Let's say I made 5x what you made over 24 years (it was definitely more, given the stock market returns we have seen)
- In the last year, we got my full 10-month payout, one month of vacation, and now unemployment checks. No bonus or stock.
As I understand in community property states, any income earned by either spouse during the marriage and all property bought with those earnings is
considered community property, owned equally by both spouses. Likewise, our debts incurred during our marriage are shared debts. So while I was
the primary breadwinner for 24 years and am now unemployed and drawing benefits that are a fraction of your income, the wealth accumulated
during the years when I was the primary earner is considered joint property, regardless of who earned more. So when it comes time for us to divide
assets, the law would look for a fair distribution that considers the entire marriage span, not just the current earning situation. So that's the 24 years I
was the primary breadwinner as well as the last few months you were.
But what I heard you say is you think you are paying all the bills now because you are the primary earner while we draw from our shared investments
(which are 1/2 yours). So, given the status quo, how do you think that you are disproportionately contributing to our marital assets? I can understand
your perception from an emotional standpoint, but I don't think it aligns with the legal view of community property. Just like I can't say I was paying
for everything for the previous 24 years. It might feel unfair given our recent shift in financial dynamics, but I don't get how it's different with you as
the main breadwinner, even if the change in our roles feels abrupt or unbalanced. I feel like we just swapped roles for the last couple of months
(though I don't think you make 4-8x what I did given my payout and unemployment benefits)
You worked to make us an effective team, and we could not have accumulated our nest egg without your contributions to our household. Those let

me focus on a high-paying job and make great investment choices in the market and real estate. But in a community asset state, the 50/50 model
doesn't change even when our roles are reversed. So your current earnings, my payout, and my unemployment benefits are just part of our marital
estate. So if we are currently drawing from our joint income and investments to pay our bills, why would it be viewed as drawing solely from your
earnings? Till we divvy everything up, everything is still the same, right? It's just you have been contributing more these last few months. The same
way I did for the last 24 years is the way that I interpret what is going on now.
Definitely not trying to argue. It's just how I interpret community property until we go our own way after the divorce. And as I mentioned today, I
really hope we learn to be civil enough to effectively partner with financial professionals to make the best long-term decisions as a team (we both have
a good head on our shoulders). Especially when it comes to things like "when to sell what" wrt stock to pay the least amount of taxes as our brackets
evolve and change. Of course, the same goes for the house and condo sale. Given the interest rate hell we are going to be dealing with, essentially
forgoing all that we tried to do, we may not be able to reasonably buy homes for years to come. Divorces are utterly devastating to retirement plans
along with future quality of life, given the self-inflicted opportunity costs.

I have replied on the original. I would like to go back to Phase I guidelines. On both sides. If either is in violation we make a decision. Can we agree
rather than going to the lawyers? I am agreeing to follow guidelines as well. Let’s don’t escalate. Thanks!

The net is it’s more expensive but your cool with that, but also may take longer. So want you to be aware it may be later for AD pick up. That said, it

<< Please wait till you can take a moment and really read this. I know I send you a lot of emails, but this is actually meaningful >>
Today you said something critically important to closing out our relationship in a more timely way with less acrimony, possibly setting us up to teach
the kids something valuable as a life skill.
The “two things can be right” recap:
1) You could not let me know what was really going on because you thought I would be trigged. It was a safety thing in your mind, and you had no
choice.
2) I was getting an overwhelmingly positive signal. I agree you said things had to change and I thought they had. I believed I had listened and done
what you asked.
It was an impossible dilemma. A catch 22. There are nuances and blame we both would like to disproportionally heap on each other because of the
awful situation. And neither of us wants to bear the burden of blowing up our family.
But I have no desire to fight about that. We are not in a safe enough space to play with that fire yet. In good time after some healing apart we can
consider it.
But today you said “I want to tell you something I have never told you before, I endured this for twice as long as you and I have never even had a
moment to process”... and it made me think- this is so much more than just me involved.
I have always made the assumption you were full steam ahead. Happy about it all and loving your decision. No concerns, you won the lottery with
that July 5th call- No more Big. And tbh I don’t see the collateral damage weighing on you in the least.
So what? Here’s what- the last six months have been sheer unadulterated hell. We have compounded our problem 10x fold. And we created our own
ever worsening self fulfilling prophecy of literal doom. And we are spiraling out of control.
We can’t turn back time. Too much blood has been shed to forget. But, we still control our future. And we know now so much left unsaid has done
so much damage, that we should consider doing something different moving forward.
In your moment of transparency and honesty I honestly understood where you were coming from. I get it. Finally a window into the black box of
inexplicable despair that I needed desperately to understand. I even think we have a lot in common.
These moments, these hard, honest truths, if we open up, like we have not before, will allow us to be relatable and show vulnerability to each others
perspective. We don’t have to be right, we just have to make an effort to understand each other.

But to this point we have each dug in hard. There is only one POV, it’s mine, and it’s right! But that never really works. And it has proven to be even
more destructive than the original sin that got us into this place. We are repeating the pattern.
But I hope, that the two people who raised three kids and dreamed of forever can find the time to start communicating again. Perhaps show some
humanity for each other. And agree this was not on purpose. Blaming each other will never help us.
We had our reasons for making the decisions we did. But we see now that they were driven by bad data and incorrect assumptions. We stopped
communicating and got it all wrong.
I’ve made my point. And because I’m learning, and trying to get better now that I know, I am not asking for anything. I just wanted to share my
perspective.
It is my hope however that after 30 years of doing a bad job on both sides of being honest and compassionate, that we consider creating a safe place.
One that helps us understand how we got here, in the hope we never do it again.
You are our cycle breaker. The hero! We have a plan now to course correct- every problem we had but this one. Lets not throw it away or minimize
this. Let’s take advantage of your bravery. Let’s put something positive together that leaves us with a legacy we can both be proud of and we take
forward as a win.
Let’s start with compassion for what the other is feeling and not start by blaming, let’s communicate honestly with each other again,  let’s give each
other the space to heal separately without constructing a wall. And in good time let’s find a safe space and setting to compare notes and start to heal.

Today was a shit ton of work. Tomorrow will be the same. I’m done for the night trying to sort and organize and it will be a repeat tomorrow and go

I’m going to cancel Wed/Thurs appointments and sort things before I throw more into the equation. We can swap bed sets next week. I’ll just use the
beach couch to save money and then think about a decent kitchen table and chairs instead.
Then maybe we move the beach table and chairs over to the garage instead of the couch as we had considered at the same time we swap beds. Please
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I can address.
I feel like you are being a great partner in this effort and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. We will all be much happier when we are settled and
only need to work together on basic, regular kid stuff. I can’t wait!

the week.
She also sees us laying out cash because of our divorce now that I have a reasonable place. But this is our retirement not a pile of money that is a first

I’ll also be taking stuff from the house today. I’ve done a decent job prepping AD that we are a team on this effort. But in absence of a discussion I

But I do need some reassurance. I am working my ass off and trying to do right by you. I am giving it my level best to set us up for success by
extricating myself from your space which will limit the acrimony from continuous property conversations. I am trying to help our relationship
improve.
What I cannot stand is repeating recent history and the explosion of our marriage. I am asking you be 100% honest with me at this moment. We are
working well together, and it hopefully is the start of things to come. But if you are just going to tell me later, you did this to get me the fuck out of
your life so you can move to something new before we close this out, it will be too much for me.
I like the way this is. I want to continue. This way has so much potential. But we know the excuses of the past and the devastation it caused us and so
many people who depend on us. Please tell me if you are being honest with me now, or if this is just a show again because you think I will be triggered
otherwise. I have to know this time, now that I have learned my lesson the hard way.

I don’t control your behavior and I must act and respond accordingly. There are consequences to any actions you and I take. We need to own that.
Once you and your lawyer have had time to digest, I’m sure you will formulate a response.
I believe you likely know the issue but probably did not think through the consequences and fall out. Maybe you did and just did not care.

If Adrian has any concerns they should not come through you. I am more than happy to address with him directly or with you there. As I have asked
to do for months now, but you have refused. But acting as the gatekeeper for conversations about me to the kids as you have done since July when

This should probably be a separate thread...
I’d like to chat with you at some point when you feel comfortable in the future. Not about this. More about how the two people in June turned into
January. It’s in no way about blame or finger pointing. It is more an acknowledgment of both our deep shared disappointment. In ourselves for
waiting so long, and each other as we try to find blame for a lost dream shared. Based on what I’ve learned, it’s an absolutely logical evolution from
deep love to the acidic hate we share now. It is a testament to how true our affection was for each other. Unfortunately, we now see that same flame
burns equally hot on both sides of hope and disappointment. It’s likely not going to solve anything, but a deeper understanding of the human
condition might ease our mind and help us make more compassionate decisions. After all, they say that the “truth will set you free.”
As I mentioned, clearly not for now. But please let me know when you might consider some reflection.

Ok.. I have tried to get a head start on a possible next LUGG move on Monday per your request. I have included the items you noted yesterday and
replied with an update to our "Dad on the Eastside" email.
I want to be sensitive to your platform asks but feel like the email format is going to serve us better for the fine tuning so have sent a much more
legible version to your Hotmail. For your records and consistency.
I am also copying and pasting the same content here, but it will not be easy to track or understand inline comments. Frankly, it is a mess so I hope we
can use both platforms appropriately. Thanks!
------------------------Start of email------------------------------------------------
There is a lot of stuff here. I don't think it will all make it. If you can look through this list. Let me know what you think. If we agree, I can distill it
into one manageable, prioritized list to share and agree to. I appreciate the help and cooperation. Getting our homes and stuff untangled will go a long
way. Thanks!    From You:  "Big items are peloton, your bike, inversion, grill, green egg. Let me know if anything else See below. I have gathered
clothes, ski gear, some electronics, art, decor, miscellaneous household items in front room so it should be an easy load up. Sounds good. Please don't
send junk stuff though. Let's just wait till mediation and when we need to make big decisions on our final places when we need to swedish clean and
put stuff in storage...
Original "Split List" TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).OK You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd
like to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in your sitting room.Furniture: I will move our sitting
room and guest room stuff to new place.I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may
prefer that from a measurement perspective. OK for guest room I am using beach stuff so we don;t need to buy anything. If you would prefer it I am
open to swapping and renting but it's your call. Patio: We agree it's not used, so I will take, but we can truly divide in mediation.OK They did not
have room for the crows nest stuff. I'd like to finish that part of the move.Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.You
can take all the grills. I will not use them. Does this include the green egg? If not, I can arrange for the dump. Sounds good. We can move those over.
Note there is a smoker that is under the hot tub mailbox as well.  Misc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?
Can take bean bag from man cave, Pelloton, Stair Master, desk all from Man Cave. I have nice Crate and Barrel art pieces that are not hanging up that
you can take a look at and decide. You can also take the Moose in living room, cows head on porch. From this list I would say we move any pieces that
you feel like sharing, the cow's head, I can take the bean bag if you want me to but I want a black cover so may need to order? Let's sell the Peleton. I
assume Max will need the stairmaster.  Kitchen: Realistic division of shared assets, I think you are working on that.Do you want the Crate and Barrel
yellow plateware set? I pulled out the SBUX set that I bought 10 plus years ago, and have started to use that. LMK if you want the whiteporcelain set
that was on wedding registry. Its barely used. and the plateware Christmas set from your mom. Just LMK. Let's wait for medition to start divying up
more of the plateware. I am fine for now.  Decorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.OK Love to still do this.
My place is bleak. I could really use your help as we discussed. Linens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?
Both households could use a refresh. Let's do this. I am happy to let you decide and just dupe. I am happy to order us the sheets that we used at the
beach that are so soft on the skin.  Other furniture for consideration
Master bedroom: I can use beach stuff as a temp option. We swap the mattresses.AgreeI think we are going to swap these at a later date. I don't want

I guess it's a good thing I put this here...
Per the discussion just now where you said I demanded to be in the house to get the TVs and hung up. I did not.
What I said was "Logistically you make the rules on how this happens, and I am happy to go along with them. If there is confusion, I am happy to
facetime to answer any questions"
That is not a demand to be in the house. It is the opposite of a demand to be in the house and even offers a logical alternative to being in the house via
a Facetime call.
I am happy to continue the discussion as you are threating to move my thins to storage while I am trying to work with you and saying that I am
making demands that I am not.
It's documented. Let's just please work together.

outlined. I have undeniable proof that will come out as you push your narrative and deny but your choice.
If you thought I was monitoring you in the Tesla, check log ins. Only times you will see is the evening you burst into the Kirkland house demanding I
use it to unlock the car and when you called me at work asking for the same as you locked yourself out at a local Sbux. I was unaware of the tracking
feature. Furthermore, you control all access and permission settings so I assume you could have deleted me at anytime. Please do so. I have deleted the

You continue to believe I can be treated differently than other humans. Can be abused, disrespected and my rights violated with consequences.
Nothing left to discuss on move other than scheduling the lugg.

Message 402 of 4024
When you sent this, I read it and left immediately. Adrian and I have been texting all weekend and you are correct in that I did not understand the
situation as well as I would like to. That goes for both tonight and since this all began. Admittedly I did not grasp the gravity of the situation initially
and should have treated it with the import and urgency it deserved. In my mind, I had my interpretation of what happened and did not give enough
credit to the merit of your interpretation. That was a mistake that I apologize for. I should have been more thoughtful of your perspective. I am sorry.
We had a pretty explosive discussion on this topic today. We talked about the back-and-forth between the lawyers and your dissatisfaction with the
current situation. You told me what your plan of action was and then said that I needed to make it right immediately if I wanted to avoid that
outcome. I want to be clear that I heard you and have taken action to that end immediately. But there is more to it than that. You feel like your trust
has been violated. You feel like that still might be the case. You are not confident in your safety and want to feel comfortable in your own space.
That, I agree, is an inalienable right. One that you should not have to ask for. You are entitled to that and I would like to do any and everything in my
power to assure you have that, not only for yourself but for the children we share. You are all still my family and I would give my dying breath in your
protection and I would like the opportunity to satisfy your concerns. Put you at ease. Give you 100% confidence that things you know have happened
have an explanation and are not dismissed as crazy musings. No crazymaking, just an honest discussion of the facts comparing our notes.
We are clearly in a tenuous legal situation. One that limits our opportunities to speak freely. But... since this all went down, and the gravity of the
situation has become clear, I have spent a considerable amount of time thinking about the situation and possible outcomes, peaceful and otherwise.
And because we can't realistically do this in email, I'd like to propose a "take II" of our conversation earlier today. I'd like to hear your asks, and present
the thoughts I have to see if they might perhaps alleviate your concerns and lay the foundation for an honest path forward peacefully and respectfully.
If I may, please note I took time and sat on your email. I am trying to demonstrate the seriousness and respect for the situation I have. And I am scared
to death to even send this, but I have to try and answer your questions and give you what you need and deserve. If you need time also, please take it.
But please consider what I am proposing as well. It may make all the difference in our future.

I have one xl van Lugg booked for Friday AM
The plan is for me to look into getting a big truck as the week progresses and if I can, I will book that and cancel this.
The only other question is, if that is not possible, I can book another xl van for noon. Then we use two xl Vans instead of a truck. Still not great but
throwing it out there.
After yesterday, I am honestly not expecting a response on this or my other more important offer today.

Christine, I apologize for not informing you about my access to the Blink garage camera last week. I understand that this has caused an invasion of
your personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to assure you that my intention was never to monitor you or the boys in a way that would
compromise your privacy. I acknowledge your concerns, and in light of those, believe it would be best for us to separate any shared services, such as
ATT and Xfinity, where activity information is accessible to both of us. This will ensure you feel comfortable and secure, knowing that you are not
under any form of surveillance. Every account we have is shared today, so you are of course free to examine anything you’d like.
Regarding your concerns about cameras and electronic monitoring, the Blink cameras at the front door and garage door were installed when we both
lived in the home. They are plainly visible and serve as deterrents to potential intruders, similar to our security signs. These are the only cameras in
place. To explain what happened, I believe when the movers were there Tuesday with all the doors open, the wifi connection to the Blink cameras
refreshed.  The cameras have not worked in the past because they are too far from our wifi.  But with a clear line of sight and wifi signal, it allowed the
camera(s) to reconnect unexpectedly. But I can confirm I never watched a livestream. I opened an alert when it fired, reviewed move pictures of the
house taken Tuesday, and various other apps and photostories (at different times) when Adrian was visiting Wednesday. I did not know he had any
concerns at the time, but would have addressed them immediately if I had.
I am sorry my actions invaded your privacy. This won't happen again. There are no audio or video surveillance devices inside or outside the Kirkland

First, my mental health has taking a bit of a beating too after my soulmate and mother of my children blew up my entire life without so much as a
warning.
In fact, it was the opposite of a warning. It was confirmation we were better than ever. I expected to hold your hand and care for you (just like I did in
Alki) till the day I took my dying breath.
Our vow was through sickness and in health. And I agree we share a lack of understanding for each other after your decision. But you are not solo in
struggling with the outcome of July 4th and then July 5th.
Lastly, if you are just telling me that you are not going to be involved in this and expect me to mop up our entire love life here and send it in a Lugg,
that is news to me. So we should clear up if you are washing your hands clean of Alki commitments, like you did me.
And I don’t care to fight. But I have a right to my own feelings. You express yours every time we talk. Once a week via a text does not seem
inappropriate. And as I said, I don’t want to fight. I’m just trying to coordinate the situation that I was left to navigate.
If you turn on text we can do this much more effectively. I assure you I will stick to our rules.

So it’s frustrating dealing with you. You never respond to what I have said. Ever. I did not say you put him in the middle of this. Just like I did not say
I needed to enter the house to move when I suggested FaceTime instead. You respond to words you want me to have said so you can justify a fight. It’
s unproductive. We have to go back and forth and show you I never said it, putting the real issue on pause. Then you get pissed when you realize that,
and cut off communication so the issue is never addressed.
If there was inappropriate behavior of any sort I should be alerted. That’s the way things should work as parents of shared children. You say it was
appalling and he should have never seen it like this is some sort of porn situation. But again you won’t tell me what it is. What if whatever he thinks he
saw actually has a reasonable explanation? Is there any possibility that he might have not understood what he was seeing? Because I sure as hell did not
open any of your nudie pics, our Amazon shopping history of kinky bondage and sex toys, or your hidden KO folder of pics and gifts swapped. And
that is the only thing I can think of that meets this bar.
Wrt to Lawyers, I have been telling you that we should connect for a week. I think just presuming that there is no interest or I have been dumped as a
client is again, you making things up in your own mind. I have tried to communicate for a week now. But somehow you are 100% privy to everything
and I’m totally in the dark. Don’t you think there is an issue there? Is this really serving our best interests to say that we are not interested in trying to

If you recall Max is a liar. You are the one who confirmed it. You said you never told him that you were divorcing me while you were in Hong Kong.
You said it was a lie. And I sure as hell know, as do you I NEVER beat that kid at 2,3,4 or later in Mexico.
You just don’t get it. You have vilified the fuck out of me. They still don’t have a separation story. How fucked up is that? They just know Mom is

I’ll sell your half of the investment accounts on open in the AM. If you give me the routing number for your private account we can  severe at least the
2.5 this week. I don’t want to be responsible for it. You take over since you say you make all the money anyway.
But one night as you stare at the ceiling, in your brilliant mathematical brain you might wonder “we spend WAY beyond our means, far exceeding my
salary... how is it that we kept it afloat and our numbers still went up.”
Then you can try to buy your next house. And with that same brilliant math head on your shoulders will do the calc on a new home at 7.5% interest
rates. You probably will not remember how hard I road you to get us to sub 3% but you might. But if you really thought like I do, you would have
locked in our ARM when had the three chance.
Sorry for holding you back all these years in the way I mixed our portfolio, still tried to take care of the kids, and provid a vacation lifestyle. So since
you present yourself as single to the world to the shame of your family (while you are clearly still married) let’s be sure you can be single with your
investments too!

I tried to work with you and you started yelling and bitching at me from the get-go. You said I was abusing you as you laid into me and would not talk
about the move. I repeatedly offered to discuss the move. All you would do is insult me and still refuse to discuss the move.
It got to the point that I had to hang up because all you do is complain about self-determining situations that you create and I don't want to be a part
of that. I told you multiple times we could discuss the move only. That was not acceptable.
Instead, you want to put your head in the sand and make us do this bullshit exercise where you refuse to cooperate week after week, just like the
parenting plan you drug on for six months.

Do you check work email? We are addressing a very serious issue right now and it has some urgency. I would like to know how to communicate with
you in a way that doesn’t take 24 hours to respond. Please let me know if work email is better, I’m happy to do that, but would prefer not to.

Wait. I did not say I was threatening you. That is what you said. No big deal though.All I’m asking for is a way that we can communicate more
quickly and effectively on our son’s mental health. I’m not trying to fight at all. But when we chat you interrupt and then hang up. We need to do
better and I should have access to my son’s mental health concerns. That is all I am saying.
And I’m not fighting about Dr Brown. Let’s do it. But I think the way you are mandating a unilateral mental health decision is not right. I would like
some way to collaborate on his mental health. It’s like if we need to make other health decisions. Or to a much lesser extent something as simple as his
school choice or religious freedom. But these are the types of decisions we should make together.
That’s all I’m saying. And I don’t want to make a fuss. So please let me know how we work collaboratively like we did so well all day in a timely
manner, especially for the health and welfare of our children. I’m their Dad. Until I’m not, it’s a reasonable ask.
Can we work together please?

The Kirkland xfinity account was under both our names.
I have requested updating the Kirkland Xfinity account for change of ownership to just be me under my name, my email, my cell phone. This is in

The Alki and Bellevue xfinity accounts are under your name only so I do not have access to them.

Thanks for the parenting ultimatum. You did not need to send it again. You have been sharing your ultimatum all afternoon. I’m reasonably
intelligent enough to have recognized that the first time you made the unilateral decision despite the concerns I told you I had and tried to work with
you to reach a reasonable solution. I’d still like to please.
The irony of course is you won’t have the discussion based on your IT expertise that tells you my explanation is wrong. While you needed help to
change the WiFi password, reboot the network, flush the router, connect your laptop and phone (you did not follow basic written instructions on
password requirements ) and now you have locked us both out of our own accounts.
It feels a lot like you have explained a very simple transfer pricing principle to me, me but I keep telling you that you are wrong. Over and over and
then used it against you.
Recall I did this in our home, before your very eyes for 25 years. Going back to Napster with you in my lap to download to a laptop and stick a
cassette adapter into our tape deck to play our Favs. You are fairly wealth based on my domain knowledge as well.
Might you pause for a moment, consider I know what I am talking about, and love the kids (and actually you too) enough to try and help you? Why
on gods green earth would I try to harm a head on my kids head or violate the woman I still love. I told you I dreamed about us working out last night.
I long for a better relationship with you. I don’t want to screw you (well... lol)
If you can take a moment and think about the fact that I am still begging you to please give me the feedback that any spouse deserves so I could make
you happy I’d follow it in a second . I would do anything on earth to show you I  heard you, And we would be in a better place. We get frustrated
with the overall situation and fight dirty (like we always did with each other) but I’d do anything to have a good relationship with you.

Hey- sorry, did not see this. We went from coordinating the move and fixing Xfinity in real time all day like champs. But once you dropped off it was

We did discuss the remotes. In text and over the phone several times. I said the bed won’t work, and told you the TV one was white and had a green or
blue rubber cover.
If we did not discuss it why did you bring some of the things we did not discuss and put them on my car? We think alike, but that’s a stretch to think
you came up with that by yourself.
Either way. It was great working with you today. We got a ton done. And even with all the Xfinity mix ups I was able to get it fixed. Please do check to

I asked you to work with me about six hours ago. I worked with Xfinity as noted, to make you as the sole owner of 1210, and made sure I moved
Diamond status to your account. So did my best to set you up for success. And asked you to confirm you were happy with the new private set up.
It is approaching midnight. You stopped communicating and I still have no working bed to sleep on and no internet access. You have changed the
password and even though I’m listed as the owner now, I can’t get in because of the password change that you made. And they need to know why I
want to reverse something you did intentionally with them.
I told you that you took over my account all afternoon. We have so many mails on it back and forth. You said you were working with fraud and it
would be 24-48 hours. I kept asking just to call me so we could tag team like we had successfully all day. I know this stuff. But you still refused.
I made sure you were totally dialed in. Set up Lugg moves on the fly. You sent junk to my place after we agreed not to do that, sent me a bed that is flat
so I can’t sleep on it, a TV you know I need the remote for and are the only with access to my WiFi. Sheesh Christine. You are actively monitoring me
now (and we know we both know how it works) and sleeping on my bed with me on a couch.
Tbh this is really messed up. Like what do I need to do to get my admin access back from you? I showed you everything today. And got you up and
runnjng after you screwed it all up not following simple directions. So you know how it all works now if you paid attention. And now you can see
everything I do, just like you were complaining about with me.
The difference is you have done this willingly, knowingly, and in opposition to my asks. When we shared access that was voluntary on both parts,
whether you knew what you were doing or not.
But now you know!
I don’t want to fight. I’ll work with you to get my physical and digital property, IP, and WiFi access back. But like the kids, I’m asking to work
together. It’s not right for you just to steal it all from me, monitor me, and unilaterally control access to my digital life after making such a huge stink
over this the last ten days. You have to see that, right?
We don’t need to have the attorneys for this. It’s common sense. Can we please work together like when I was leading the charge today and everything

We used to have a deal, for better or worse-never wake up mad. I’m proposing we fall back tomorrow to our defense mechanism. I don’t care to fight

day that it made you nervous and scared and made me overconfident and hopeful.
Then the wheels came off. I am sorry for pushing blame on you and want to do better myself. I plan on doing some beach stuff tomorrow and also

If we need to connect before game you need to swap thoughts. I’ll be bringing you three Samsung universal remotes- living room, sitting room, our
bedroom. They will need batteries. In a pinch, AD usually has one or two hoarded away and then they have one in the man cave...
I will also bring you a decaf as usual. Let me know if you would like a 2/3 decaf instead. I’ve been enjoying that lately.
Adrian should be there 15 minutes early. So 12:45 if you don’t mind. It’s important for us both to set an example. Success is a habit

For the beach, I have a couple of the big suitcases. I have two hanging garmet bags.  Will also bring some boxes but I think I left some as well. Not sure
if we need some big trash bags but if you have, bring.
Note that I am waiting for a spot to charge so I can get back and forth today. I will be underground of course with no cell or WiFi. But promise to

- For richer, for poorer <<nope, as soon as my settlement payout cashed, so did you>>
- In sickness and in health <<nope, not for medically certified diseases, like SUDs>>
- Forsaking all others <<nope, I have pictures of "KO" from your that prove otherwise>>
- To love and to cherish <<nope, you lied repeatedly then dumped me with no warning>>
- Until death do us part <<nope, if you are reading this and I'm typing, we are still here>>
You can mentally wrestle with this all you like to fit your narrative. You can say that fucking me 3 times a day, regular date nights, shrooming every
weekend, healthy handmade lunches on the regular, musings of time alone, house hunting for the next chapter, dreaming of our future... was just
soothing. It was not. You were all in, above and beyond. And I fucking LOVED YOU for YOU!
The reality is you really do get it. You act like you don't, but your not so stupid not to realize the difference between "soothing", which would be just
keeping it on the rails vs. doing everything you could, going above and beyond, to show me we were working, we are on the right track. The changes
made were being rewarded. You made me happier than I have ever been in my life.
The narrative you are trying to rewrite makes you feel better. You self-soothe. Yes, I was an alcoholic, I did fight mean (as we both still do) But
marriage is about honesty and transparent communication. THAT IS THE COMMITMENT. You did none of that. You said "fuck it" I'm done.
You washed your hands clean without so much as a peep that what I was doing was not right.
You ruined our marriage with your dishonesty and deception. Period. You can justify it by saying I would not have changed. But you can NEVER
SAY YOU TRIED. What you did is not what our wedding vows mean. You broke every single one of them, Christine. You owed me the truth, not
lies and deception. You were my fucking rock. My proudest moment. My queen forever.

Is it even worth trying to get sorted? We have move, Alki, Dr Brown... and whatever else, all with hard deadlines and you going out of town next

Frankly I’m tired of trying with you. I was going to suggest starting the day off right like yesterday, but that honestly went nowhere and was a huge
waste.
I don’t want to fight, and I’m tired of this bullshit OFW where you log in every 8 hours and then complain my stuff is at the house while you no show
at Alki.
The hardest part I guess is even if we make rock solid plans you just fuck it up and then complain. Then threaten me to mail my shit or move to
storage.
Friday we had four bedroom pieces to move. They only moved one, and it was busted. They acted on your direction and moved a ton of junk instead.
Then you fuck up the whole Xfinity thing before acting like we did not have remote exchange plans. Meanwhile I ordered yours before you even
asked.
I wanted to write a nice email and suggest working together. It’s just not possible with you. You won’t communicate or stand by set plans.

So... we agree we are both escalating. If I read correctly, you started it, telling me I’m an abuser and began the 25 years of terror discussion, not me.
Your mo even when we in good times is that you say crazy stuff, are incredibly mean, and expect me not to reply.
I will find that to be challenging. Reflecting on the Golden Rule, you do unto others as you would have done to yourself. So don’t do it to me, and I’ll
be better about not doing what you just did to me back. Does that sound like a good plan? I can do it.
I’ll also struggle if you continue to lie about your lies.
It’s too much. You stood with me on a dirt path at Tumblecreek swearing to me, that what I am able to send to you never happened. It did. I have
pictures to prove it did. And you still deny it. Did HR see those?
Your dishonesty and deceit is undeniable. Yet you stand on a platform of an utterly false reality you created and preach, ruin my entire life, take my
queen, kids, home, money, and livelihood. All while you proactively destroy my reputation with friends.
Perhaps in your haste to ask me to reflect, as they say “physician, heal thyself”. Take a moment to examine your deeds. We should be strolling the

You don’t problem solve. You intentionally obstruct progress to elicit a response that suits your legal

Message 631 of 4024
We have a difference of opinion.
Your emails started with you couldn’t figure where I put it in the mess of boxes and bags. Putting blame on me for not having AAA card. That
appeared to be a first poke.
I responded that I gave it to.
That seemed to provide you with enough that I poked you first versus responding to your attack, to decide it appropriate to launch into what you
wrote, which was not related to location of card at all.
Your perspective.
Unless you need any additional help with AAA I’ll consider the issue for AAA help closed.

I just said that all of my stuff was dumped from organized drawers (not in the drawer, but by drawer). You may say you have a different perspective
on if you did that. But you did. And I can show you that you did. Just like any number of things you have done to me, denied you did, but I can show
you with proof. So if I can prove it with 100% certainty, like I have shown you before, I don’t see that as a poke. And I see your denial as just you

Check it out! You can send one that says to the other person that you are just thinking of them so they think of you. Or even that you love them.
I just thought they were glasses or candle holders. They are actually not. They are deep and meaningful gifts to illicit mutual feelings. Awesome!
BTW- the sexy Cum Together rocker with the message of enhancing someone’s flavor, over time, is sold out. Tell KO to hold on to that one!
Hmmm... I was saying that because he can sell on eBay for more. But he won’t sell those. They were a gift from his dirty married secret.
It’s funny because you saw how much your gift of Cabo glasses meant to me. No inscription, 20% of the price. He’s lucky by comparison to me.
But it is what it is. I was just your soulmate of 30 years. Father of all three of your children, even taking one on that you made without me.

So.... To confirm, as I called you out (like I am off to do when you don’t tell the truth on critical matters of our family’s destruction) you can NOT
stand by your assertion below? You always have a reason, or explanation when we know you are being dishonest.
With Yurushka it was, “we are not doing that” till I showed you a digital footprint that what I was saying was true and you were being dishonest.
Then your story evolved’ let’s say to accommodate the truth; and you said your dishonesty was actually justified.
I can go on.. KO,  Xmas, vacations, telling our close friends I’m an abuser. Honestly (if you know what that means) if we just start being truthful it
will save us about 80% of the time we waste talking to each other.
Let’s just do that!
- Start being honest with me
- Don’t say things you can’t prove
- Stick to the truth and move forward
Then there is zero need to hang up like you do every time I call BS on your fake reality. No need to record or have someone eavesdrop either. Let’s do

I have shared this is the situation you unilaterally created by refusing me the slightest insight into the situation. So I can not address. And because I
stand by what I say, I will attach it again here for reference.
Note that I am still all in on a mutually agreeable path forward with Dr Brown even though you have rejected every piece of her advice or
recommendations to date. Let’s just be on the same page because you have proven over and over to manipulate both therapist, our narrative, and in
the end, the output.
Specifically, for tomorrow I’ll ask Elsa over as well to help me around here. It’s not because I need the supervision of the young woman I raised and
walked down the aisle. It’s because I do not want a fight.
Most important is that I show Adrian he is not banned from his life here so he stops the incredibly destructive “self-blame” he is left to wallow in
today.
I hope a chaperoned visit sounds like a reasonable compromise and assures your concerns are met.

Let’s go to court and get this sorted once and for all. I am making arrangements to talk to my lawyer.
Cancelling plans to talk at 12:30 today. It does not feel safe nor will it be documented.
Communications will be strictly on OFW.
I will not respond in evenings and during times expected parties to be asleep. Immediately response is not also required or expected.

Communications that have anger and areas where it feels threatening or unsafe I am flagging. The restraining order will cover and will be shared with
your lawyer shortly.
If emergencies, at this time, I have the kids so nothing should be needed.

Whoa!!! Stop. Let’s talk as planned please.
I don’t want to fight. I just asked if you could show me that you have full custody. I am not going to fight you. I am happy with our parenting plan

I finally got in
Christ... I’m reading what you wrote. Christine. Please don’t blow up. What on earth did I do? I agreed with everything you asked below. We also
agreed (and chatted once already) that Dr Brown for AD is important enough to address today. It’s the way we started this thread.
And the only question I had, I specifically said I would “pause” not fight. Not escalate. Pause. What else can I do to not be confrontational with you
other than to ask to stop that discussion if it made you mad or we just disagreed. That’s what pause means. Literally.
Why are you escalating, making threats, and refusing what you have already agreed is an urgent enough issue to talk immediately. I said I would pause
Christine. I did not escalate or do anything that should cause you to feel unsafe.
Please re-read what I said. I don’t want to fight. Why are you escalating when I asked to stop the discussion and work on the most immediate plan? I
really don’t get how asking you to stop a discussion we have a different pov on is worth an escalation.
Why are you doing this?

You agreed to the restraining order knowing the impacts.
Given the escalation of tone in emails, texts, calls, it was prudent to put in place additional guardrails around communications .
This morning’s email was just another example of an unwanted and disturbing communication that was intended to cause distress and disrupt. It had
nothing to do with kids or other areas we are navigating.

I thought you did not use your Amex. You have said that on many occasions. Like over and over. How did you spend almost 15k on a card you
assured me that you don’t use. I can find the many emails you said that in if your memory is failing as it has since July 4th.

The items I listed are ready to move. I have not touched anything since that last lugg move. You were aware of items that were moved. In light of
concerns of recording devices and monitoring equipment hidden in residence, I would like to move these items out of the house as I am uncertain if
in your belongings.
There is still hidden a router that is broadcasting a WiFi signal and the hidden Blink modules that I haven’t located.
Parenting. The children have expressed concern in regards to safety. I suggested Dr. Brown to assist navigating. You are refusing on this platform

There are still some items that hit that account but I have moved majority to BofA. Some items likely hit the Amex when BofA did not have enough
cash and we needed credit to cover.
Can you move your charges that currently hit the Chase card to your Amex or fidelity to track spend.
I have tried use BofA debit for household and kids expenses.
We will both need to provide details of all cc spend for all cards when we do financial disclosures.

There continues to be spend on card, especially since we are unable to keep sufficient cash in BofA account to cover basics such as mortgage tuition
and rent. We have overdrawn. You control the msft account (which is community property) but the other investment account I am able to access
Moving forward I too will initiate stock sales if cash runs low.
The sales of msft stock from that account is from community funds. You have blocked me from accessing and I currently have no visibility.

You are welcome to do as you like. I would not recommend it as I have employed a strategy that has netted us ~55% over the last year. But you do you.
I have told you on numerous occasions to just let me know when we need cash. I like to generate income as long as possible. I have never delayed a
transfer.
I’m not trying to argue but I don’t get how there could be more spend since you stopped in October. And especially ~15k. I trust you, but it makes no
sense.
Happy to move to Amex too like you. I was just doing so much on Amazon that it seemed like a sound decision. Do you feel like that is not the case!
I understand what we will need to provide. Why are you telling me that? We also are supposed to have a parenting plan in place. That has never
mattered.
If you want to have an all up “Running List” discussion I would like to at your convenience. I assume you have to initiate, I will be kind, and it would
help.
This OFW thing is fine. I am happy to abide by it so you feel safe. That is super important. But I hope you can still use the phone so we can really
progress.
With all that’s going on, especially w.r.t. to the kids mental health it would be much easier to sort ahead of time rather than in front of them. I promise
to be kind and constructive.
And if I am not, end the call. No second chances. But for you and the kids I assure you I will be on my Monday night behavior. When I honestly
thought we started a new chapter of cooperation till we did the opposite. Please consider.

I’d like for us to discuss Dr Brown and how to engage. I’d actually like for you and I to meet first and asked her how she would suggest we address.
Like we are doing with Ms Betts.
No offense, I am happy for Anna Lisa to author the text, but I want her no where near planning for ADs mental health. Fair?

Can we try 9:30? I can make it work.
We can also be nice and knock out some of our other stuff if you like! I’m all in on working with you when we are not competing with the days stress
and noise. For that matter, maybe unless it’s urgent, we could set a time to knock stuff out. Maybe 20 minutes every other day or something?
I want to figure out how to make this work! It’s no Monday at the beach, but we can make it work within our new boundaries

Yeah, we need to discuss this a bit. You were not aware of the services you had. This had zero to do with me. We need to be clear wrt to
1) the cam issue and the explanation
2) what happens on Xfinity as a service
If we are going to put this to bed, let’s do it as a team working for the mental health of our children. We should both be all in. Me, on my apology, you
on your acceptance. And tell the same story.
Let’s not mess with them. And if you really don’t understand what I have explained please ask. If you think im still lying anyway, let’s please don’t
agree, sign the RO and still undercut the story.
Does that sound reasonable?
I’ll watch for alerts. Thank you for doing that. It’s freaking nuts, right???
Next up Bank of America  I’ll explain what they told me and let’s see how to fix.

My lawyer and I are discussing your proposal on how to use Dr. Brown tomorrow and will come back with response on that and your replies to my
requests for information.
First Xfinity, BofA, Alki and CC, I don’t have your answers but that will now need to go through lawyers. If you want to send your responses to my
asks here you are welcome but I won’t engage in those discussions anymore.
Premera can walk you through how to submit the Luis bills and re submit Yurishka bill for reimbursement. As Yurishka is from last year you will have
a limited time to do so. I am also uncertain if you sent the doc from my work to get the cobra portion of me and kids insurance reimbursed that was
erroneously charged.I have not seen any more charges so you may also want to check you are still paying the cobra premium for your insurance

Super bummed we came to this after Monday. The giggles and jokes in the elevator seem like yesterday. I honestly thought we had battled back. To a
place of kindness and cooperation. Where we understood the finality of our situation as we emptied out the place where we shared so much. But we
were going to be kind, share grace. And work together to do the right thing, and make smart decisions. That is why I texted you my high hopes for a
new start.
Is there any possible way, any way at all that we can take one day and just let this rest? Stop the fighting, lay down our arms, and maybe not find
kindness, but at least find civility. There are so many hurt feelings for opportunities lost. But may we please pause for just a moment and take some

As mentioned, having Elsa over yesterday was a great help. We made progress unpacking and organizing things. Small progress.
That said, the most important thing was when she was watching me tear the place apart holding my SoberLink case and said “oh, if you need that, I
packed it at the beach. It’s in the black Thule case”
This is the gift from you of course. The problem is, I have not located that Thule case in the tens of boxes and bags I have in the place. It’s really
harder than you might imagine.
I’ll stop everything this AM and just focus on finding that. She was just trying to help, and it is not her fault, it’s mine. I bring it everywhere, and felt
like it was important to have when we saw each other.

But I did not consider that it would be grabbed and stuck in a random box as part of our move. Still, all my fault even if it was just a series of honest,
well meaning, mistakes.
Please let me know if you would like a UA and I’ll be more than happy to accommodate. I will also let you know if I find it or not by end of day so I
can offer next steps for your consideration.
I consider this to be child related, so hope you agree even if it is part of a parenting plan we don’t have. So hope OFW is suitable for this.
Regardless of having nothing mandating this, it is still important to me to demonstrate my commitment to sobriety and assure you that I am always
sober even when I can’t see my kids.
Obviously if we need to address in front of a judge at some point soon, I’m sure Elsa will testify to this, but it is ultimately still my responsibility.

I assumed you knew it said that. I’m not trying to argue. I’ll copy and paste it here. I thought it was on purpose?
Is Max sick again? Is something going on. From afar it seems like it is an issue that I’m a little concerned about.
I am happy to reach out too. But we have not had a moment to discuss final messaging and who does what. I’d love to move ahead ASAP.
I asked Lisa if I am allowed to CC you on mails where we need to work on things together yesterday,nbut, as Anna Lisa knows well, she sent all of this
the day before Lisa was scheduled to be out for two weeks.
I am bummed because it is reminiscent of the close of business meeting before a holiday before going dark the week after. It just makes things hard on
you and it seems and we fight. That is unfair to us imho.
I guess in the business world, I would not wait till the night before Chinese New Year to send a critical, large, time consuming request to my
colleagues in Beijing. Anna Lisa should confirm what I said. I made sure she knew of Lisa’s plans two weeks ago.
But I’m not trying to pick a fight. Please don’t take it that way.
I am not sure what the enrollment for Max entails but assume it is just affirmation that he will continue at SAAS.

would never harm you all. Ever...
Per the attached, you and Anna Lisa are saying:
- There is a Serious Concern for Safety: The court believes that there is a legitimate and convincing reason to be concerned for the safety of the
protected person. This is not a speculative or unfounded fear; it's based on credible evidence of similar incidents.
- Physical Safety at Risk: The focus of this statement is on the physical safety of the protected persons. It demonstrates that the court has a real and
demonstrated reason to believe the restrained person will cause physical harm to the persons ordered to be protected.
- Justification for Restraining Order: This finding is the key factor in the court's decision to issue the restraining order. It justifies the need for legal
protection because there is a clear and demonstrated pattern and history of physical abuse from the target of the order.
- Increased Vigilance and Enforcement: With such a clause in place, law enforcement and the court are likely to be more vigilant in enforcing the
order. Violations will be treated with greater seriousness given the perceived risk to physical health and safety of the protected.
- Potential Impact on Other Provisions: This clause will influence other aspects of the restraining order, such as restrictions on proximity,
communication restrictions, and other specific behaviors. The proven threat of bodily harm makes the request highly credible.
- It's important the restrained person and the protected person understand the very serious implications of this clause. The restrained person must be
aware of the seriousness of the situation and the need to strictly adhere to the terms of the order to avoid legal consequences.
- The protected person should understand they are asking for this level of risk mitigation and can demonstrate a history of this behavior so the court
can take all necessary precautions for the physical safety of those being protected given its likelihood of happening again.
Message 813 of 4024
Just to reiterate, I am not trying to physically threaten you or the kids in any way as noted in the RO or with this communication. If you feel quoting
the RO you sent, along with the associated research, is a threat, please let me know immediately.
If so, I promise to address your concerns immediately with my attorney and the court to reassure you, the kids, and the court that I am not
threatening physical or sexual violence now, or ever. Even if you think it is likely to happen in the future.
You just asked me to "Show me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers." So, I'm trying to accommodate my
interpretation of your ask, understanding you did this with your lawyer with a clear intent and purpose.
I will never physically or sexually abuse you or my children. If asked to sign something implying, I have and am likely to do it again, to keep you from
pursuing much more serious courses of action against me, I am just registering my concerns.

I have a lot of questions and concerns about some of the content below and the moves I am making that you may not be aware of. I also have some
things that you should have that impact things like our taxes. I would not want to violate the RO however.
I just don't know how this will work without at least a little planning and logistics coordination. I feel we will stumble over each other and may end
up using something that the other has plans for. Or one of us may be unaware the other has a pipeline move waiting to execute.
Anyway, as mentioned, you guys know Lisa is gone for the next two weeks and has several additional dates on the calendar for out-of-state trials and
other engagements. I'm looking at our numbers and am afraid we are going to crash and burn without coordination.
Even if we had some sort of approved "running list" meeting with strict ground rules it would go a long way. I am trying to assure you that I will be on
my Monday behavior (and would have continued if I was not blackballed Monday PM) But this is the last time I'll say this.
Fingers crossed because I'm making moves, and I am sure you are too. I feel we are flying without a net and unless my subject line is always "Our Kids
Inheritance" as a way to address, we are taking an enormous risk to our fiscal viability before mediation.

I’m going to tell AD I love him and I have all his stuff packed up ready to go back to Kirkland. I have always told him I was proud of him for sharing
his concerns and will continue to do so.
I also would like to share what happened so he knows my explanation and that I agree with what he saw. I need to let him know I can’t see him
anymore but I love him dearly and he can always call.
I know we have plans for Dr Brown but I don’t know what they are and I think I have accepted after all these months of trying to get something,
anything in place, i just won’t see my boys again.
I’m not a victim, there is just always a reason that all this horrible nightmare won’t end. And if it’s all my fault - you, the kids, retirement, I need to
eventually accept the blame and start a new life.
Please be there for AD... I don’t want him upset but at some point I have to be honest and stop leading him on. We FaceTime every day so he can see

we don’t answer each other’s questions or respond when the question asked was answered.
I am not trying to insult you. It is not a knock. But if this is the singular way we are going to communicate about a single topic, I guess I should
calibrate my expectations. If i am doing this wrong, please let me know so we can be more effective.
Do you mind letting me know the Canada agenda since it is an international trip? Just for peace of mind.
If this is how it’s going to work, or not, and this is actually the “fast track” may I please ask for a possible path forward that will get us back to
Monday?
I assure you that I understand your concerns and will not cross your boundaries again if given the opportunity to collaborate better again.

Ok. I appreciate the reply. But I have noted that you do not really reply several times. And you still do not really reply. Here or on the other threads
where you requested info. I shared it, then you go dark.
At first you asked questions, I responded. I brought up issues that are both substantive and important to address for our children and I am only using
OFW as intended for the topics it was intended for.
Nothing on the “beating you and the kids” in RO
Nothing on your Dr Brown next steps or timing
Nothing in the possible running list discussion
Nothing on a future path to normalization again
Nothing helpful on you owning BofA account
Nothing on timing of all this just as Lisa goes out
No agreement on SAAS, you unilaterally decided
The only thing you bothered mentioning twice was what you wanted to know about- The Xfinity alerts.
I’m not upset, but I recognize it appears I am being played. There appears to be no sincere effort here.
It’s unfortunate as I was really acting in good faith per your instructions and hoped to make progress.

I just recognized what I find difficult about your emails. The ask is often buried in a long discussion of complaints and feelings. The list below is
helpful as I can see exactly what is outstanding, but when surrounded by extra words that are unhelpful, the focus moves away.
Ask for future emails to be concise about ask without superfluous language.
RO language. I’ll need to review. I assume you discussed with lawyer and agreed to content,
Dr. Brown. I suggested to reach out and request engagement to assist on how to navigate this situation, with her individual speaking with You, myself,
Adrian and Elsa. I disagree what was in The letter for how we use her reccomendations as it should be for guidance only, and my lawyer will respond
to Lisa.
Running list discussion. I am not comfortable with a call at this time.
Path to normalization is with assistance of Dr. Brown.
BofA account. It is a joint account as I understand we both access. You were to set up your own account. I have not seen boys money from Beth
deposited into their accounts but I assumed you cashed, paid off credit card for Bend bills (700 flight charge was actually booked to my Amex as your
delta account defaulted to my Amex which has now been updated) and were going to transfer money to boys account for their Christmas gifts.
I could not time discovery of cameras and subsequent steps I need to take to ensure safety. I don’t control your actions that needed to be address. It’s
unfortunate Lisa is unavailable to help you navigate. .
SAAS we had discussions you would reach out and apparently told Adrian you had. When he told me you had and asked about response that’s when
I started asking you and you never responded. I have not reached out to Jonathan yet but plan to do so so he has an email Monday am. If you disagree
let me know and proposed next steps
Xfinity. Noted you have confirmed alerts have stopped. If they reappear my expectation is that you will inform me. I will ask my lawyer to formalize
that request to Lisa.
Going to engage with the group now and enjoy whistler.
Hope the basketball game goes well. I’m sure Joe and team is grateful for you to step in.

Hi Robert,
Adrian shared a video you sent him and Max in regards to all devices that you have access to and are connected to via WiFi. It was confusing to me and
Adrian was very confused as he believes he is still being monitored and is very concerned and anxious.
Can you provide a list of all devices you are still connected to in the Kirkland residence or have notifications or access to? Per letter from your lawyer
the Xfinity’s notifications was the only one that was remaining.
I understand the Xfinity’s alerts to you should have been stopped and you would provide notification if this was not the case.
Thank you

Message 834 of 4024
Hi Christine-
I do not have access to any of those devices. They show in my Alexa account because I bought them at some point over the last >10 years. They just
get associated with my account as the purchaser.
That said we have intentionally connected them in the past of a matter of convenience and automation when we were one big happy family. It made
sense. But I don’t have any connection with them now.
I spent some time talking to AD today. Like a lot. Very deep. Really thoughtful. I also discussed the event we shared, and what the video was showing.
It would be great to further those conversations ASAP.
As for Xfinity, I’m still locked out. We spent quite a bit of time trying to get me in by changing user names and passwords. Still no luck so I cant see
anything I should. But no new Kirkland alerts I think?
I’m also not able to make changes to my ATT. Double factor auth goes to your Hotmail. So you’re the gatekeeper. But not sure how to fix unless you
do it, but you can’t log in to get that far. Catch-22?
I’m happy to continue to offer assistance in any way I can but back and forth “gotcha OFW” messages are not going to interest me. Especially with no
counsel in town. I just wanted to put you at ease tonight.

The communication sent to the boys with video which they sent to me because it was so alarming in nature and indicates continuing monitoring is
below. I have shared with my lawyer and guess will address when yours is back.
Also attaching soberlink test results which indicates you have found the device just choosing not to use it and doing tests spaced 1 minute apart.
I’ll share JUST the Alexa devices in this video to show you the things we have that light up and throw alerts. We were a geek family ... 
We have around 60 Xfinity connections- Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, nest, smart bed, picture frames... they all give a signal when they are used.
Then we have ATT. That shows all data, by text, phone, streaming, time and date. So we can see every number we text or call and when we did it.
Then you have other connected home apps, Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home, etc... all can control, alert, light each other up.
This happens if something is connected or has recently reconnected for the first time in months. The Alexa’s do it all the time. So do the cams.
Anything with WiFi.
We can literally tell almost anything about what each other is doing with these signals from Xfinity and ATT
- Total screen time
- Tick Toc time spent
- YouTube visit frequency
- Websites you visited
- When you get home
- When you leave home
- Who you text/call
- Naughty sites you visit
All of this is a good thing when you are one happy family. It’s safe protection. But if someone suddenly gets kicked off the island then it’s called
spying.
Anyway... we can play a fun game where you describe “how could you know if I xyz” and I’ll tell ya. You will be amazed! But smarter!
Love you guys!

I’m sorry you are taking this approach when I was trying to be helpful. If you would like to drive over right now, I’ll hand you my phone, go in the
other room and let you try to connect to anything in the house. You will not have any luck.
The billing address for my Amazon account is 1210 Kirkland ave. So every device gets set up there by default. So it looks like I have access to things at
that address. That is not the case. I’m sharing everything, and trying to explain transparently.
If you read my note to the boys, you will see it is just trying to explain the signals we get and how they can be used and interpreted. I’ve tried to tell
you many times as well and it is the reason I insisted we separate the ATT and Xfinity accounts.
If you would stop using OFW as an assault tool to send to Anna Lisa, and want to work together as Lisa mentioned, I am available, but you just don’t
even care to learn the basics. If we sit, your phone, my phone we can stop this nonsense in 30 minutes.
Wrt the SoberLink. I found it when i was at the beach. Packed another load, and it was in the boxes again last night. I pee tested today for you so you
could see I’m clean on my own. But I thought it was to see the kids which you don’t allow anymore?
P.S. I just reread my explanation. Why is any of that wrong? It’s spot on. I’ll play the same game with you. It’s all there and real. It’s literally a selling
point for each service. They advertise it. Not punish people who use it. I feel like I’m traveling back in time.
See attached. I can send as many as you like. They are registered to you. And offline. And given they are 8’ish years old before I even had an Amazon
account I guess I should ask you how you made them show up on my app. I’m trying to explain this to you.
tbh- this is all nuts. It’s beyond nuts. Being an intentional Luddite does not make me a criminal. And the fact that you insisted I beat you and my kids
recently and am a threat to do it again in an RO is insane. Every day this is more unhinged.

Your dad's message describes various ways that digital devices and services can track and record user activity. His claims are very accurate, as many
modern devices and services do have the capability to monitor and log various types of usage data.
Here's a breakdown of the key points mentioned in the message:
1. **Xfinity Connections (e.g., Xboxes, phones, laptops, switches, Nest, smart beds, picture frames):** These devices, when connected to a home
network like Xfinity, can indeed transmit signals indicating their usage. For example, a smart bed might record when it's being used, and a Wi-Fi-
connected picture frame could log when new photos are viewed.
2. **AT&T Data (text, phone, streaming, time, and date):** Telecommunication providers like AT&T can track data usage details. They typically
have records of calls and texts (including the time and the number contacted), as well as data usage details for streaming and internet browsing.
3. **Connected Home Apps (Samsung, Smart Life, Smart Home, Google Home):** These apps and devices can interact with each other, often
providing notifications or logs of activity. For example, a smart home system might log when lights are turned on or off, or when a door is opened or
closed.
4. **Alexa and Cameras:** Devices like Alexa (Amazon's virtual assistant) and Wi-Fi-enabled cameras can provide significant amounts of data. Alexa,
for instance, records voice commands, and cameras can log when they detect motion or are accessed.
5. **Detailed Activity Tracking:** The ability to track specific activities like total screen time, time spent on specific apps like TikTok or YouTube,
visited websites, and even the tracking of location (such as when someone leaves or arrives home) is possible with the right setup and permissions. 
6. **Monitoring Texts/Calls and Visited Websites:** It's indeed possible to see who you text or call and what websites you visit, especially if the
network or devices are configured to track this information.
All these capabilities exist, and it's important to note that accessing and interpreting this data often requires specific permissions and sometimes
technical know-how. In a family setting, monitoring is viewed as a safety measure, but it's crucial to balance safety with privacy and trust. The
perception of such monitoring as either protective or invasive can vary greatly depending on the context and the individuals involved. 
In conclusion, all the technical aspects of your dad's message are accurate, but whether this constitutes 'spying' or 'protection' can be subjective and
depends on whether this was initially set up for family safety and convenience or implemented as a way to surveil. Remember these services are offered
to protect families, not spy.

I have some legacy address settings that still get applied to some items. Would you mind bringing mail and packages to Adrian’s practices till these are
worked out of the system?
BTW- I am still stumped on how to explain the standard services and gadgets we have in a way that you and the boys will understand. It feels like you
all have so limited knowledge it’s a non-starter.
I wonder if there is an immediate solution to host a safe discussion. Perhaps with Elsa, Milo, Katherine there. Someone who knows tech at least the
basics. Because we are just spinning right now.
Or would you like me to search out YouTube videos, author a deck? You guys are just so so far off wrt to understanding even the most basic things we
can’t have a productive discussion. It’s frustrating.
Can you imagine trying to explain accounting to someone who doesn’t known what numbers are? To them, they are just symbols, or little squiggly
pictures on a page. That’s literally where we are now.
Sending this to Anna Lisa in the end is not helpful. If
you have a question or concern we have to address it. It’s all very straightforward and easy if you take the time. Can we find a safe space for that
conversation?

The text messages is accurate. We have family plans, Christine. Please go into yours and you can see what is tracked for yourself. This is a service. This
is not spying. I keep explaining that.
If everyone wants to pay for their own accounts that is fine. Phone, internet, Netflix, Xbox, office. We did this as a family till you did your thing. That
is normal. Please don’t present it as otherwise.
If everyone chooses to be thier own person, and ignore that we are a family, that is ok. But i will not be expecting to pay the bills for that. It is an

The game suggested is very real. I am trying to teach you all about your digital footprint. It is not spying, like the way schools offer internet safety

I still need log in credentials to the blink account I have never had knowledge of or access to. Deleting an app does not delete an account.
For employment, if you are saying you are no longer employable because of the RO, that’s your position and we will prepare our side accordingly.

I'm super bummed our kids think there is spying going on and I'm not sure they are getting the most accurate answers to their concerns. So I hope
you can help. To close on the phone and text messaging comments, I want to clarify the history of call/text reporting, the nature of these reports, and
our mutual access to them as account holders. And when I was thinking about it, I realized they have likely never even seen a paper phone bill.
I hope you will tell them that the activity described, which includes calls and texts, has long been a standard practice by phone companies that began
in the 1980s for long-distance calls. Which were expensive. The purpose was to ensure billing accuracy and transparency to customers so they could
manage phone usage. This used to terrify me when I would sneak down River Oaks Parkway every night to secretly call you in Hong Kong.
So as account holders, we both have always had access to this information. It is our family plan after all. I even think we used to get a paper bill
ourselves. But it's not a form of surveillance by me or you. It's a standard feature by ATT for accountability, fraud detection, and accurate record-
keeping. And your status as an account holder inherently includes consent to reporting your data back to you as a part of the service agreement, we
have.
I get without context and having never seen the fat white and blue envelopes with tens of lines of numbers inside, they don't have history. They don't
realize that roommates or families would grab a highlighter and take turns finding their boy or girlfriend's phone number and say which calls were
theirs. Then pull out the calculator to total everyone's share of the bill, just like we did with restaurant tabs when we would split up a big dinner bill.
They should know that our intention was never to monitor or surveil their phone usage. The logs on our bill for phone and text records is just a
routine aspect of our phone service. It has gone on for decades now for good reason. It started with paper fifty years ago and has since largely moved
to an online bill where it's possible to filter, sort, pivot, and categorize history just like you can do with any online date. But it's not spying now or
then.
I hope since you have their ear, and I can't teach them like I used to do, you will explain so they understand. It's just good parenting, and I trust you
will convey the message and ease their unfounded fears. I think we all grew up knowing that every number we dialed would show on the bill so we
sure as hell better not spend all night on the phone with our future wife in Asia. It's just funny how we lost that history and the tribal knowledge
since.
Thanks!

Is due Feb 7 in amount of 7,612 to cover Max’s ongoing school enrollment,
With a balance of 6.7k in BofA currently which is  insufficient funds to cover tuition in BofA plus ongoing expenses.
The 40k transferred was to cover my Amex card for 13k plus Chase/Amazon account for 28k.
When I looked you had paid off your Amex for 9.5k (I had no visibility balance) and your lawyer bill of 3.6k  which was not factored into the 40k. We
also had to pay deposit of 3.6k for SAAS reenrollment which was shared.
Given that, I had only paid off 20k of chase so there remains 8k balance before new charges and I haven’t paid Alaska card of 2.5k.
Let me know when funds will be transferred.

You are charging some things to Fidelity that I have no visibility to but decide to charge others to BofA that I can’t factor in as you give me no
warning.
I told you balance for my Amex, the chase card under my name that you put all your Amazon and unrelated Amazon purchases on. That’s what we
agreed the 40k was for.
You then pay off your Amex and lawyer fees that I have no visibility to with BofA . You use fidelity for expenses that I currently have no visibility too
either so no idea what your are charging.
Blaming a low balance in BofA for your hits that you give me no visibility to is strange.

I think we will cancel Rec Hoops practice Friday. Most kids have a dance and Joe is OOF as well. It would be good a good opportunity to let AD
practice AAU this week for a change. That said the quality of play on this particular team (with some exceptions) is pretty freaking good.
I am a little worried about his health. We both agree he was under the weather. I appreciate he wanted to do it. but it's also sketch to try and play at
50%. If he is sick on Sat I might have to tell him he can't play. But he should support the team if possible. Just keep me updated.
I'll be coaching solo again this week on Sat. It was good of Surya to let me know that his dad was complaining about his playing time and they wanted
him in the game more this week... lol Seems like a nice guy but it's a dick move. Take over boss.. show is all yours.

- Know if even switching this year is an option for us now
- What a reasonable plan would be if he could not move
- Want to start something we are not 100% prepared to act on
- Know if the financial situation is going to be an issue for us
And as an aside, we really need to know what this whole thing means to our future fiscal viability.
I have always hoped we would be civil and even aligned well enough we could think big picture in terms of the actual execution date of the final
paperwork so we could "be divorced" but if it was going to make a ~100k difference (making up a number) that we would be flexible on the date given
all the long term implications.  But even saying that given recent history is kicking a bees nest so let's table that. I assume we won't have that luxury. I
can dream.
So we need to make some assumptions we are not sure will come to pass and come up with a roadmap that assures he can go to SAAS and what it
takes to make that happen. The elephant in the room is when I can find work. That helps a lot with our planning. Even if we have no idea what our
split looks like, we know more money and a dependable revenue stream always helps, no matter what. That is not a debate.
So, there is another bee's nest. As I am wandering around this place, up since five as usual, trying to sort my life from bags and boxes, as you and I
normally are manning our battle stations for the day (again maybe all my fault) I have to be realistic about trying to start an entirely new life (you were
able to continue your sans me), attend therapy, and be ready for the next crazy, while trying to land a job at Amazon or Google. We know the toll that
took on me when you were fully in my corner. So that weighs on my mind as I apply for jobs. And tbh, in my mind there is just no way I can work if
things are like they are now (my fault or not) or even land a job.
So... without a fight, we need to decide if we have enough confidence in our direction and desired decision to make a Go/No Go call on the bullets
above. The reality is we can, we are just at a high risk of getting ourselves into a situation that we cannot sustain. My feeling is we need to have a really
honest discussion about what we see as our next steps. SAAS is a little microcosm of our macro picture that could be a forcing function for us. I went
WAY OFF into the weeds but wanted you to understand my perspective. I want to work. I want to be settled. I want stability. I want to be what I was
to our family for 25 years without the bad parts.
But I am not confident I can do all that in the status quo. But I can assure you my goal is to continue to provide support for my family, monetarily
and emotionally for - you and the kids. That was my lifelong commitment, no matter what.  But it's not going to be solved in OFW. And I am not
pushing you to go off OFW. I am asking for realistic ideas for how we have a peaceful and planful discussion on SAAS right now along with an
acknowledgment of the macro factors that I am trying to consider every day. If this in any way has kicked off a fight, please let me withdraw the
thoughts above and just get back to a SAAS decision this week.
 What would you like to do?
Message 870 of 4024

So while I might be able to do better without you, as a unit of "resource-generating horsepower'', what we did together, as a team, was generational.
I honestly don't believe solo, I can do better without your contributions. You were our backbone, while I was the muscle. Muscles don't work
without strong bones to anchor them. We both need to be realistic about what an amazing and irreplaceable role you played in what we were able to

into normalcy again. Perhaps even what we can look like as a mature family embracing the next chapter and reassuring him it will be even better than
the last. That is why we are doing this after all, and thus far it's a promise not kept. 
So this is the 911 call AD deserves right now. He needs to see we are listening to him, and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most
importantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life. When he needs us, we will drop anything:  appointments,
schedules, our problems, for him. We put our differences aside and find one voice between us, as it should be when he needs us most.   
Proposing you and I do the following:
We try and meet AD where he is, and you even serve as gentle training wheels for us
- I call him tomorrow and say we should all get together to discuss the SAAS option
- I ask if I could come grab him after school Friday to help clean up for a big family meeting
- I pick him up wearing the Homer Simpson shirt he got and a new Nike Tech replacement.
- We go to my place and I show him the progress on all his ideas at the place he picked out
- We decide on a to-do list of home improvements to make it shine before the SAAS summit.
Now it's his day! He is number one and sees it in action. He has a gentle re-entry with Dad as we work on a todo list and we can talk about where he is
at. We get things in order and prepare for Mom!!! Now this is something he never thought that could happen last Monday. 
- When you arrive, AD gives you a tour of the place that he picked out and shows off.
- Mom let's him know how pleased and proud of him she is and that he has great ideas.
- We make some popcorn and serve some drinks and he can play host a bit for Mom
- Then we talk about SAAS. largely info we know already, but he has a voice to hear 
- We make some foregone conclusions, but he feels like he is driving the decisions
- We can even play a game of ping pong to feel normal again for once since July
Afterward, Dad can serve juicy steaks or Mom and AD head back to Kirkland. Ad knows he is first in our lives and has confidence after seeing us
together that there is no more "lost in our mess" he feels today.
If we can please do this, and put our issues aside, I assure you this could be a game changer on so many levels and possibly accelerate some of the
healing even before we get in front of the shrinks!
It is so important right now that he sees Mom and Dad do what was impossible before. He will go home happy, with hope. It won't solve everything
nor diminish the hard work ahead. But, for a night, he sees anything is possible and perhaps this new life might not be so bad after all. 
Remember, I proposed to you to get you back into the Family Photos and we spent the last 29 years together raising three wonderful kids. I hope you
will trust me on this one too!

I am not going to use this forum to debate our feelings and perspectives on it, as we have a different view point.
I am following up with my lawyer on how we might communicate on this issue in a way that is productive and I feel safe.
Please respect that I am in a different place in regards to what has transpired and am navigating as best I can.
I still believe Dr. Brown can assist but that has paused based on your feedback.

Wait. Why is Dr Brown paused? It was your idea. Lisa said yes. I thought we were full steam ahead. When did that get paused? Are we not doing

Do we have any plans to move forward? What was the point of it if nothing has changed? I'm not fighting. I am asking in earnest just as I have done

Message 897 of 4024
Just had an interesting conversation with her. I called to be sure that she knew phone numbers showed up on our bill but it exploded into how I
ruined her life. I may not agree with some of her characterizations, but that does not matter. It is her perspective. Her perception that it was me alone
trying to figure out what was going on in High School was surprising but understandable.
She told me she saw the cameras in September and thought you had put them up. I wish we had the discussion then. But it was a small point to what
she opened my eyes to. And it is consistent with the talk track you have played to me. That in my alcoholic years, you felt a need to acquiesce to me.
You were just trying to keep the peace and not rock the boat. I needed to hear that.
I understood then as she snuck boys into her room, sent underage porn on her phone, vomited vodka over both sides of the truck (she had been
driving), lost a six-figure full ride to college shoplifting for a boy, and made LBGTQ offensive online posts, what we were doing to get her back on the
rails was mutually agree to. we both were trying to sus things out together.
But her perspective is that it was all me and has always been all me. And now this incident is just a continuation of that behavior. It is important to me
that I know now that I am seen as the villain in this family. That we were not the team I thought we were. And at least in her mind (and maybe yours)
I was doing all these things to be nefarious and ruin her life. I need to think on that. 
But most important is the insight into where I think you are coming from. I thought as we were raising our kids we were aligned. But you are washing
your hands clean of that. That this was all me and you had nothing to do with it. It is a history that does not match mine. But I was an active alcoholic
so maybe I was missing things that you were telling me or misinterpreting things.
Either way, it was a deep and insightful lens into the narrative you and the kids have. And at this point in my life, it helps explain a lot. I believe
marriage takes two, but if the perspective is it was all me as some despotic ruler, I want to acknowledge that and do some soul-searching on how this
came to pass. How I thought we were making parenting decisions together but were not.
It has been said that "If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.”
Maybe I'm that asshole...

I hate OFW formatting...
Without the running list discussion, our list is piling up quickly and will only get worse. We can do it this way and still live, but it's not going to be
good for us or the kids, and probably bankrupt us in the end. 
Then there is also the reality of situations that arrive on the fly like Elsa this AM. At this point, the fact that she blames me for her entire childhood
and you were just a bystander may be a deal breaker for her and I. Historically we spoke with one voice. Hell, I think July 5th came to a head because I
was defending you. But it's a big deal that may mean we don't talk again for years. We are quite literally crashing and burning. 
I almost feel like we need a general contractor to host a summit for us. But at a minimum, we need to figure out what we are trying to do here and
how to communicate more sustainably. This is more harm than good.
Here is what I have for today. I hope we just try to touch on issues with a quick Ack and next steps. Then wait for Anna Lisa to tell us when we can
chat about the mental health, safety, and well-being of our kids.   
Running List- You're speaking w/ Anna Lisa, thank you! What's the plan, She's not responsive tbh. 
Adrian- Our most important item yesterday. You won't consider my plan. Can we have a fallback?SAAS- Still stuck in neutral here. We need to have a
bigger discussion on financial commitment. 
Lugg- Are we aligned on day/time/payload? Who is going to set it up? Did I tip them? Use Devon?Dr Brown- Can we fix email? What's scope and
outcome desired? Is she expected to adjudicate?  
Xfinity, ATT, Bofa- I get alerts still, you are the 2x auth on ATT, you get all my stuff for BoFa now
SoberLink- I finally located and put an airtag on it. I also peed and sent that in. Are we good?
Truce- We agreed to try but it feels like you are not in a place to really try this now. Thoughts?
RO- what was the intent and desired outcome? I signed it but nothing appears to have changed. 
--------------------------Cut line?-------------------------------
Elsa- Big bucket. no apology to you? our swinging? no shared responsibility, all me that did this? 
Communication- We agreed to see someone, we did not. Now we can't talk. Can we address?
One Voice- You said kids don't know. Appears you have talked in great detail to them. What's up?Transfers- We are covered right now (agree) but we
need the running list discussion to sync. 
Emails- you do them occasionally. Should I do that too? Are we allowed to CC each other
Bills- what bills are you no longer paying? What should I be picking up that I am unaware of ?
Boys Blink- I shared an apology. You take issue with the explanation. But can you share "sorry"

Boys ATT- You know bills have phone numbers. You pay the bills. Can you share with kids?
Boys Xfinity- Should I share YouTube showing how it works?. They promote this, not spying.
Therapist- What should I do to be sure that we get reimbursed? Do I do it or do you, and for who?Job Plans- Shared a thread yesterday. We agree it
would help. Not possible in the status quo.
Beth Check- It's here somewhere in the mess. I'll locate and move to BofA- Xmas gift/Bend trip
Alki- Went down pretty well, pointed out the obvious. Will pay for trash removal. Refund possible.
Spring Break- I think we wait till after Dr Brown to have a realistic discussion about the options.

You can see the times they were thrown in the pic. I assume it’s Ms Stephanie? But it says “new” but she has been there before. And it also threw two
separate alerts for what really is probably the same phone. Anyway, I’m here for ya if I can help debug at all. For that matter I can meet you there, let
them fix and test on the spot. Then we know it’s resolved.

I was thinking about this a bit more. I can either have a deck and links, or we can go through each of these three things together on the fly. We can
start with you and me, or with the kids. We can do it on my phone, laptop, or your phone, laptop.
Or I can put it on the big screen if you like. I will take any special request you like and accommodate. We can use either of our accounts or both.
There is nothing to set up or can or set up ahead of time. It's all real and legit because ... it is.

I just want to teach you and show you. Just like the kids did at Christina's house for the internet safety course they took. I hate hearing Max and
Adrain are scared when it is something we can fix right away with just a few demos and Q&A.
This is super important because:
1) This creeped the kids out and now I have no way to let them know they are safe.
2) Because this is the singularly biggest thing causing all of the problems in our lives.
We are putting so much time, energy, and money into this, including the cycles through the attorneys. And that seems to have put a halt on all the
things we were trying to wrap up. It has to be worth an hour of our time to be able to put this to bed and put the kids at ease again....
We really can solve this before we even start another week!

This all sounds good. Let me sleep on it as well. Also, since we are trying to clear your headspace, if something is in your way that you really don't

The thing that would honestly help me the most, is have you look at my place and think about unused accent pieces that work. That was your jam
and I know we have some extra (old hallway painting? ) I need stuff to put out, not hide away. But I don't want "Big & Little together forever" stuff
and hope we can just store for now.
A pretty productive day, Christine. Especially the Teams call where learned to threaten but back off quickly..lol. I hope we maintain now that we

No worries. I actually have that issue about 25% of the time on OFW. In general, since this all began, it seems tech has not been our friend
unfortunately.
I am open to a mutually agreed protocol for urgent or emergency situations. This was not one. But if there is one, we need a better way to
communicate.
Technically you can unblock me and we know I won’t use it because of the RO. But if AD has an issue at school (example) I could. What would you

Hope you are ok with the investment decisions I’m making. I’ve been very deliberate since July and spend time on this while I am unemployed.
I trimmed back on losers I wanted to see rebound (ARK, AMD). I was being stubborn. I’m focused on stocks I believe are best for the next 6-12
months.
That said, we still have a good chunk of Tesla I’m not comfortable with. It’s not like a real stock. It behaves like a Musk popularity contest. Still tbd
there.
But loser sales have funded bills and should help offset capital gains we see as we transition to selling some of the winners. I think it’s a win-win
though?
I realize penning this, how I miss our intellectual connection. Between that and booty, we eliminated our most electric/satisfying connections. I
digress..
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. I’d be happy to consider input or feedback if you want to consider a more conservative position
right now.
Including Vanguard as well as fyi..

I am starting this in OFW per the RO.
I can do that. But it will be in the form of a polite inquiry. Sort of like I had to do for the Vyvanse so we agree but offer a more immediate remedy.
For the meeting, thanks. I still would far prefer to do this face-to-face. It will be a much better way to build rapport with them and that is important.
If Anna Lisa could approve a Teams call to lock this down asap, that would be super. It's a big deal to me. Please let me know if you disagree.

Hi Christine and Rob,
Hearing that Max and your family are having a great experience at SAAS is wonderful. I am happy to set up a Zoom call for the three of us to discuss
Adrian joining us at SAAS.
In the meantime, I strongly encourage you to complete the Ravenna application for Adrian so the process can start as soon as possible. We cannot
make enrollment decisions without an application, and we will need it regardless of a midyear transfer or entry next year. The sooner the application is
complete, the better.
I am available for a Zoom call next Thursday between 8:00 and 11:30 or Friday between 12:30 and 4:00. Would either work for you?
Thanks

When you respond could you let her know yes will start application in Ravenna, but tell her if she needs immediate details for Adrian we had the
application completed for 6th grade in the fall of 2022 and perhaps they could review that to get a head start. This might remind her directly we did
this for 6th grade already.

First- how do you and I coordinate our thoughts and plans consistent with the true spirit of the RO? You lead, I’ll follow.
Second- let’s jam out the request today. I want to be responsive and timely. Then let’s agree on a time and send a response that captures both in a
single email and also asks if we can do this in person.
WRT the impending divorce, it’s not our friend in this discussion so I’d prefer that we appear to be a happy, well adjusted family. That way it does
not look like ADs issue is really home life, and not ICS.
If that is controversial to you, let’s move to OFW to discuss.

Hey-
I’m trying to figure out how we do this for Max and even me. The Vyvanse is over 1k name brand w/o insurance and around $450 with. I know that
caused a stink before with us.
But I know Max just recently had his Rx filled so I am wondering how we did that because the generic has not been available for sometime and it will
help me decide how I do it too.
And side note, I’m hoping that by coming off your Starbucks insurance as you asked, and moving to something else I don’t have a worse plan where I
have to pick that cost up.
Let me know your thoughts. It’s a big number and between Max and I we could be talking about ~1k-2k a month so while it might seem like a
frivolous ask, I think it’s important to agree on.

So the way I I make sure Max feels safe but welcome is we chat a bit to catch up. And then I will offer something to do together like this "Hey, I know
you probably already have plans, but if they fall through, I'd love to XYZ with you, so just let me know" He always does but at least he knows the
offer is there and I'm thinking of him.
I'd like to do the same for AD this afternoon to shoot some hoops here. It is gorgeous and would be fun. Just so you are aware, he and I have been
having some deep, AD lead conversations- Cabo, Whistler, Hawaii, and Vegas. We have touched them all. He wants me to understand the impact it
has had on him, and know why I did that.
Every time we go there, just like when he has asked me to blow, I am very positive and reassuring. I thank him sincerely for not turning his back on me
and loving me enough to have a difficult conversation that makes him feel uncomfortable. It is a true sign of unconditional love. I appreciate it and
want him to know I'm an open book.
So, with those things noted:
- Gorgeous day to shoot some hoops
- A safe way to bow out of an offer to play
- We are having important conversations
I'd like to see if he wants to shoot hoops for an hour. I take him to practice. You pick him up!
I don't see a down said but appreciate your concerns in advance. I hope you can find a way to let "us work on us" in a safe space (nothing safer and
more comfortable than a game of pig for me and him) in a small-time boxed opportunity until you and I have a longer discussion/explanation.

So... As I mentioned, I think it’s unfair to have this conversation without setting the context first.
I have not been able to talk to anyone and have basically been shut out while fear and anxiety has only increased from the cameras to Xfinity and then
to AT&T. And I am begging not educate you.
Then yesterday Elsa weighed in with her side of the story, but she has never even heard from me. So I don’t know how she has commentary on my
side of the story if I’ve never even talked to her.
Not only that, but I never even got to hear what A.D. even said so I can speak to it. That said it turns out that he saw exactly what I saw, but I’ve not
had an opportunity to tell him that and explain.
Then, of course, nobody knows that’I have apologized to you and acknowledged that the cameras were there. And Indefinitely caught an earful for
not saying “I’m sorry” when I already had weeks ago.
So as I have me mentioned and offered several times today I would like to show you everything. I would like to do that as soon as possible. Right now,
we do not have a full accounting of the story.
Can you please work with me on at least that part? It will go a long way. And I don’t think it hurts us to tell Dr. Brown that we actually looked at this
rather than ignored all of the explanation.

If we can do this over the weekend, it really sets us up for success with Dr Brown I think. I’d love to start the next week with at least a shared
understanding of the things we have discussed, but you have never seen. Then we have some common ground. I am really trying to work with you in
a constructive and positive way to dispel FUD and focus on fact! Hope you see it that way too! Education cannot hurt us now.

The message back from your lawyer was I was aware of blink cameras ( I definitely was not) and had access to account..
Why you would point direction at my car makes no sense.
Explanation of accounts suddenly connecting after years of no connection is unbelievable.
You initially said you saw an alert and not a video of me returning. Story changed after now you know what Adrian saw.
You have not provided credentials to account where you viewed the video.
So an apology with lies is not an apology.
The video versus att and Xfinity’s are two different issues. The text you sent was very creepy.
I’m not going to debate this further.
Dr Brown will help sort out but to be clear my position is you illegally monitored us. That’s why RO and the communication protocols

There is no debate. I can show you. I have offered tens of times. I can actually show you with your own eyes. In real life. You have questions, let’s
answer them. We don’t need to fight at all.
What is Dr Brown sorting out? We definitely agreed we would work together on what we wanted and how we would go about it. Is that still the plan
or has this moved to unilateral decisions and direction?
On both counts, I am sincerely trying to coordinate and cooperate with you. But I honestly don’t think you are open to anything I say. Can we work
together on our kids issues or are you sole decision maker?

Agree it’s not helpful. I asked for a way we could talk about what we want from Dr. Brown and how we propose to do it. That is after all what we
agreed to.
So you can step away if you like. That makes sense. Because you’re actually not answering my questions. And in fact, you just turned to attacking me
instead.
Your quote below is funny about not responding to asks. Please read any of your responses and let me know a single question of mine you answered.
I actually don’t think there’s any reason to regroup if you are not going to answer any of my questions and instead just insult me and attack me. It’s
not helpful.
Are we working together with Dr. Brown or not? Do I have any say in what we are trying to accomplish with our children or are you the sole decision-
maker?

I did not see a reply. And you stepped away after confirming we would work on this.
It's super frustrating to still be doing this with you after having my place for almost a month now. I know we both agreed to work together this week
because it is taking a toll on everyone but here we are again. Not a single thing accomplished on the move. Zero. And I handled Alki for us.
Ever notice that when I do this, it always gets done? And we even make additional, accommodating trips happen on the fly? I don't get why this is so
hard, and I fully expect you to come back at me next week with more threats of sending my stuff to storage, yet again.
Like a successful marriage, this takes two. Hmmm... is there a pattern?
Or did you just play a very clever, real-life Groundhog Day joke on me.

I'm frustrated and I want to communicate with you. We are getting a divorce because we did not do that. Can we not make our divorce shitty, and
our kid's lives hell for the same reason?
The spirit of my emails is accurate. I won't repeat them. I am frustrated to see us going in circles. But it is not helpful to make passive-aggressive and
cynical comments to make my point.
I want to apologize for my counterproductive tone. I'd like to try and resume working together as we discussed Tuesday. And if I am frustrated by
you, I want to respond better than I did tonight.
One thing I really wish we had done, and will do even now, is follow Dr Brown's instructions to see someone. A professional who can help us
communicate better.  Be kind. We did not, and here we are.
And tbh, I don't want to bother with Dr Brown if we are just going to blow off her advice again. It's just a waste of time and money. Especially if we
plan to still go to meditation in the future.
So I will try harder tomorrow. I hope you do too but it will not make me try less. I hope you can start to try and give a lirttle sometimes as well. But if
you do not, I will still try to do my best.
We should not be going from bad to worse. It's in our and the kid's best interest to both be happy. To appreciate each other, and our history. We
should advocate, not defame each other.
I hope we can break this cycle. This time this summer, you were laughing till you peed your pants. Swapping yummy sides. And heading home with
lust in our eyes and love in our heart. We gotta do better.

Please don’t worry about remotes. I got you Universal Samsungs. So yours will work on either, so will mine. So let’s just swap TVs.

And to be sure that you know, because I keep saying it but it doesn’t seem to register- I had access, it invaded your privacy, and should’ve informed

I don’t know how to say sorry other than say “I am truly sorry.” I made that clear weeks ago. You wanted it to go through lawyers, so I did that too. I’

Ok, thanks.
I am sorry your email went poof. It sucks but you did a great job here. I think we start with what you are sending. I can only digest so much at a time.
Also worried about sending a bunch of stuff that just needs to go back in 8 months. The last conversation we had was me taking over the Kirkland
mortgage.
That said, if it is in your way, of course I want to get it out of your eyesight. But we’re talking about deep into the garage at this point I think. Do you
agree?
Nothing works for the Sonos unless I have the
closet piece.
No worries at all about the pillows. That can be whenever.
What did you think about linen and towels? You suggested we refresh.
I probably need to share other stuff for taxes like my unemployment info.
Hope you are keeping the good extender. I will help when you are ready.
They can only move the heater head. No propane. So it needs to be removed.
Are the socks good or are they the ones we said we would give to Max.
The other clothes I’d like to see before we move them. Still ten bags here.
I would take my backpacks I think. But I owe you luggage back.
Really appreciate the planning. We will get there!

Socks were straight from closet draw from nice ones to hiking to everyday and not the give to Max.
The bags that are in my way are mainly clothes in front room. I had emptied out the closet and dresser drawers so likely workout gear, ski clothes and
layers and the other items mentioned below. I’ll put whatever you don’t want sent over in garage so I can rent furniture for front room.

So... we definitely discussed. You said that you could make it work. But definitely wanted to move. I offered to see if I could help (when we were on
good terms) but you said no. Then I made it clear i planned to try and keep it in the family for the boys sake. It’s all discussed in email. I have never
heard that you want to change your mind. That’s why I have so much heartburn moving every little thing since I’m coming back.
Feel free to send socks
Thanks for Sonos
What are “promo videos”
Sounds good on clothes. I want you to have your space. I am hopeful we’ll find peace and civility at some point (this is neither healthy or sustainable
long term) and then we can work on garage together and I sort what I keep vs. goodwill.

On July 5th, you took everything I had worked with for three decades, almost my entire adult existence away from me. You did this with no warning
and strong and consistent evidence to the contrary. We were partners, lovers, and soulmates. And out of the blue you said we were not. You decided
to abolish ties and abandon your vows to blow up the Moyer’s, and not only leave a man behind, but take his food, water, and curse his existence. The
man who had tried to love, lead, and provide for our crew his whole life.
I was changing. I heard you. I was making improvements to everything I knew was a problem. You saw that. Celebrated that along side me. Told me
that it was the right path, and now we just needed time together. I would like to know what your next big surprise is now. I live in a foxhole waiting
every day for artillery to arrive. Can you please explain your latest secret change of plans and what you are doing next to destroy the man who called
you his queen?

You send questions. Know I get alerts and will respond. Then check out. So you are well aware of what you’re doing.
Dr. Brown was very clear on her suggestion about how we can have more peaceful communications. To make OFW work, her suggestion was to talk
to each other like you were speaking to your boss afraid of losing yourjob.
So trying let’s imagine you and Julie were working on a problem together in real time that meant a physical time commitment from you both today.
You send some q’s and step away for a few hours not telling her you checked out.
Again not being aggressive, but what would she think? How am I supposed to respond? I’m guess my feedback is you are complaining about me
being aggressive, then doing the most passive aggressive thing ever.

All of this while you are out running around making parental decisions that I have not been a part of because you assumed full custody of our kids,

For the rest of our lives? Civil?
You don’t hope someday that we can catch each others glance and remember a tender moment, a special date. I know you did not hate me for 30
years, and keep having kids. I know we enjoyed our love making. I also know you saw I was getting better. Changing the man I was to be the man you
asked me to be. I was all in.
So you can have a pov on the bad times. That’s fair. But there is no way you can deny that when you were cold, I kept you warm. When you were
hungry, I fed you. And when you cried, I held you. If after 30 years as soulmates, the best we can do is civil it will be a wasted life.

For below to happen there cannot be the volatility in behavior and pendulum swings.
What you are speaking of below is achievable for individuals who are interacting in a normal manner, consistently.
My interactions with you over the last 7 months have been at many times frightening, scary, volatile. You are asking me to revert back to behavior in
the marriage where I pretend things did not happen, brush it off, act happy, and not hold you accountable. That has stoped. I recognize my feelings
and impact and do not just move on. As I process each scary or volatile interaction in a manner that it deserves, and they continue or escalate, it
compounds and gets worse as there is no recognition that you don’t start back at zero each time. It is still in a deficit that keeps getting worse. This
behavior and reaction from me and family is what you do not recognize, which is holding you firmly accountable each time. It does not reset at zero
like it did in the past.
The past 7 months does not demonstrate that is the path we are on.

I want to thank you for this. It took time, you put thought into it, and it all makes perfect sense to me. I will not justify my reaction to our situation
but I always have held firm that V Little on June 30th would be proud that I was fighting Christine of July 5th. That I would do anything to save our
marriage and keep our family together, fending off anyone who would destroy it. And that’s what I see happening.
That misses the point entirely. I do think she would appreciate me fighting to learn, heal, and have a better, stronger rebirth that puts us on course for
forever. But what I am missing is the way I’m doing it is the entire reason we are here. The thought is noble, the execution is destructive. It’s like a
Chinese finger trap, the harder I fight and struggle, the worse it gets for us both. She would not like that at all.
If I continue the swings, the volatility, the madness, after you made yourself clear tonight in a very thoughtful way, I deserve to never walk down that
path with you. Alternatively, if I show you I listened, like I had listened this spring, and work on myself for the sake of us, I hope it has a better ending.
I realize I have reverted, I thought about it tonight. But I can get back on the right path again. I will show you.
So thank you for the honest feedback. And while it would have been great to hear in June, I do hear it now and I am acknowledging it. I’ll let my
actions do the talking and hope for the best. Both the June 30th and July 5th, Christine’s would want that.
I truly love you, Christine...
forever yours,

I’ll look through the lists we have swapped this AM and try to stack rank things for you. We agree that the front room is pri one so you are functional
and have peace of mind. Boy, can I ever relate to having a bunch of bags cluttering my space all the time! 
But this should help you out so you know the things I would want most and the things that can wait a bit. For example, I would want the pellet grill
over the green egg far and away. The green egg can wait so I will get that list to you before noon,
On my end, I will look at the things that I suggested go back to you and just start a couple boxes. We don’t need to do that today, but perhaps we
swapped them at a basketball practice or something.
I know you will be busy with work today, and it’s a Monday . So I promise not to be unrealistic about response times here, So I will just do my best if
you’re not able to get back to me. There’s nothing life or death going on here that we can’t just course correct.
Please do let me know how Adrian is doing. He sounded really bad yesterday. I hope you have a wonderful day and we are productive as a team. Please

Throat hurts, breathe is sharp pain, head ache, body chills.

Yesterday I heard him on phone with friends playing video games but very weak.
I honestly think he needs to just rest and key it pass.
I’ll give him some pain reliever.
In regards to the move I’ll prioritize front room that would help my mental state greatly. I sounds like you won’t have space to store many of items. As
much came from dresser drawers perhaps i load up dresser too and you put in the room that has laundry that you said was huge? That way you won’t
be looking at garbage bags for clothes you use infrequently. Just a suggestion.

Getting through garbage bags this AM. The goodwill pile is getting big.
Thank you again for all the work you did on your end to help us out!!! 
Elsa and I are not in a good place. She went off on me like she did when she blamed you for missing her flight. Including how I (this time) have ruined
her entire life, still look at her phone records, and have always wanted to ruin her.
Not fighting but finding out you two have been working together on the story (including her talking to her "Blink Friends") without hearing anything
from me, yelling I have never apologized when I had, etc.. sets us both up for failure.
If she was going to be involved, it would be better to transparently let her be involved. I don't want to digress at all and want to stay focused, but the
Elsa situation may be lifelong. I don't anticipate participating in her wedding at this stage.
Let's stick to the move...

I think our goal is just to get back to normal while we can have phone calls tax emails anything. But that’s clearly gonna take some time.
In the meantime, I also noted that we should consider it for more complicated lists where we need to respond in line to each other.
OFW is not built for that. And when I copy paste, the format goes to hell. We should also consider non-narrative list emails that help us.
Obviously not at this time, but we can take smart baby steps to normalcy. And if I continue to head your advice, I’m confident we will get there.

Thanks. Much appreciated. Awesome!!
I am in a rental for 8 months. So essentially short term storage. The more we move to short term storage with an expiry date in Sept. the worse my life
becomes. If I end up in our home or not.
Given I might very well be moving back into the house as planned. Let’s hold on clearing everything out. You might end up there as well, but I’d
prefer we err on the side of the last outcome we discussed.
That does not mean we can’t still sell stuff. Or even Swedish clean if you and I can learn to play nicely again. But I have two full rooms of unpacked
boxes and if Max wants to visit ever has lost his bedroom.
I am finding more things that can go back, so I’ll wait till we get to critical mass and we can bring them.
You gave some Xmas presents back so I assume you don’t want them anymore. Just gadgety stuff.
Very expensive watches (Mavado) were almost lost. Do I have other valuables that I can look out for? They were with an empty bottle of talcom
powder I tossed into the can till I heard the “thug” in the trash. Any way to tell the junk from my most expensive possessions?
Thanks again!! We are still going strong, almost a whole day under our belt! Do I see “sell the Porsche” possibilities on the distant horizon?)

Message 1139 of 4024
Good Morning,
I have your revised RO. Thank you for getting Anna Lisa to send. Two questions on the terms that I hope that you and I can discuss more cost-
effectively than the lawyers.  
WRT - [x] Credible Threat: The Restrained Person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the Protected Person.
Yesterday you told the court I had committed domestic violence. Today you are asking me to sign something that says I am a physical threat to you
and the kids. My hands have been there to tie shoes, wipe tears, hold ice packs, make love, walk hand in hand, morning hugs, and make love. That is all
they are for with you and the boys.
That is what you have seen and I hope you know is true this morning. Do we need to say you believe that I will beat you and my children? I can't
imagine in the deepest depths of my despair over our dissolution I would seek you out and physically harm you or our boys. Must you say that you
believe this to be untrue and you think I will beat you all?
WRT - The parties may also communicate via email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or
managing the parties’ shared assets.
Thanks again for this. Very helpful. But as I have noted on many occasions that OFW is a terrible platform for much of our communications. It is
better as a single subject, single reply, 124 characters, non-copy paste, short burst text tool. Most of the time we communicate on emails we have
several things we are trying to resolve in somewhat complex multi-point situations.
And more often than not, we actually do not want to conduct our "sausage-making" in front of the diner who will eat it. But your offer proposes that
they always have to be present on the thread, we can't drop them, resolve, and add them back. Can you please reconsider?
Thanks again for your efforts to partner constructively in a positive way. Given this is a timely conversation and Lisa is waiting on my direction, it
would be great if we could resolve ASAP.
best
robert

Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or emails and texts as it is demonstrated

I'll try to do this in OFW first since you are busy. You are going to have to grant me some leeway here as it is a one-sided discussion without you in
real-time. I am trying my best, Christine. 
Question One: Was the RO filed yesterday?
- No. The new RO was sent over yesterday. The court document that was filed was titled: "CONFIRMATION OF ISSUES/REFERRAL TO
FAMILY COURT SERVICES"
- Here is what you filed for the court saying there is domestic violence: "Has either party alleged (said) that domestic violence is an issue in this case?"  
YES  NO
Question Two: Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or emails and texts as it is
demonstrated they have been ugly, tone is confrontational, scary etc. nothing in recent history demonstrates that will change. I am open to your
suggestion.
Below is what Anna Lisa proposed:

"The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted herein. The parties may
communicate via the Our Family Wizard application, and the Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely for the purpose
of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding the management of shared assets. The parties may also communicate via
email with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.
Below is what I would like to propose:
- Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to
communicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward
communications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.
- Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children
and/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted for in-depth,
multi-topic communications and or "FYI notifications", without the mandatory inclusion of a third party. This is under the condition that both
parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone. If a communication is deemed potentially contentious, a mutually agreed upon third
party may be included at the discretion of either party for oversight, with prior written agreement.
- Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed
urgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior written agreement in the Our Family Wizard platform or a related email.
This is under the condition that both parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone.
- Additional Conditions: Should either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to
review and potential revision to ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.
I think this sets us up for longer-term success (important, so we are not doing this every two weeks as we grow as co-parents) but also still allows for
the opportunity to re-visit if one of us starts behaving badly... It is optimistic but the best of both worlds with a built-in "out".
Thanks in advance for your thoughtful consideration. (Doing this email in OFW sucked btw )

he definitely has not been 9 for a couple of years....

- I sent the suggestions you requested in the RO. The other is already filed. We should update.
- We are getting close to the Dr Brown date, and I'd still like to collaborate on that with you.
Please note the additional details for each in the appropriate OFW threads or eMails sent.
This stuff is stressful as hell, like watching paint dry, and creates unnecessary anxiety and stress.
I'd like to progress on these items ASAP so we can quit the back and forth. Just let me know.
But after discussing for a while now, I don't think have any way to do a running list discussion.

30s.

Hey- You're super busy so let me do the sausage-making to make this super simple, teammate! Below are the issues that will cost us a fortune and not
be resolved till spring if we don't step in. It is long but is all-inclusive, so please take a moment to digest. Ready to move when you are.
I) Confirmation of Issues:
    - You filed a court doc that says I am "a credible threat to the family's physical safety". We agree that I'm not beating you, or our boys
    - Your suggestion was: "Let Lisa know and respond accordingly requesting to remove. I’ll connect with Anna Lisa on that box checked."
II) Temporary Restraining Order:
    - An update was filed with no material improvements- still no running list, 1-1 sausage-making emails, emergency/urgent calls or texts.
    - Your suggestion was: "Can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate? I’m concerned... but open to your suggestion."

Confirmation of Issues filing and the Temporary Restraining order to better meet their needs at this time. They both appreciate the mutual
teamwork and goodwill in a difficult time.
I) Confirmation of Issues: They both agree on the following updates to the court filing
    - They would like to change Adrian Rex Moyer's age from 9 years old as noted, to 11 years old.
    - Ms Moyer agrees Mr Moyer is not presently a credible threat to the family's physical safety
II) Temporary Restraining Order: They would like the following accommodations to the plan filed
    - Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to

communicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward
communications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.
    - Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children
and/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted 1-1 for in-depth,
multi-topic communications and or "FYI notifications". If necessary, a mutually agreed upon 3rd party may also be included with prior written
agreement.
    - Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed
urgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior agreement in Our Family Wizard.
    - Additional Conditions: All communications are subject to the condition that both parties maintain a respectful and constructive tone. Should
either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to review and potential revision to
ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.
Sincerely,
Lisa

Of course, she will "legalize this" and put it in her voice. I hope you see this as helpful and consistent with the asks you made above. I fear this will still
take at least a week and probably 2k, but feel like it sets us to work well together constructively in the future. I can't tell you how much I appreciate
our partnership and updated "expectations of engagement" since your email on our path back to normalcy. I'm all in, Christine. Just watch me go

So.. yes. Please keep any required documentation that you will need for taxes.
For stock sales, I have tried to be smart about our sales. This includes selling long-term stocks if MSFT or Moyer, as well as cleaning out some losers
that won't hit our bill and might even offset some gains. So, my hope is I managed my end well and you will manage your end well.
We have always been super at this together, so I want to enjoy our "secret weapon for wealth-making" as long as I can. Amy way we can get a divorce
but keep doing this part....? lol

Of course...
I will be patient. I said it last night. I’ll repeat it today. You were my soulmate and still are my partner. I support you. I want you to thrive, Christine.
I’ll say I don’t understand how work crazies could be weaponized? “Christine’s co-workers are late getting her information... she is a bad mom”
The only thing that was ever weaponized related to a regrettable work incident and our marriage. I assume that kind of thing isn’t happening.
On our path to normalcy, I hope we trust each other again. We both have just cause to doubt. But I want to trust my best friend of 29 years again.
Please let me know how I shoulder as much burden that I can. Don’t be shy. You shared your expectations for normalcy. Let’s do this!

Happy to have him home whenever. I assure you a few games of Pig will only help our father/son relationship and it will only get better after Dr

Are you registering him for AAU tryouts?
His arm is improving. He was still feeling not great today but better.

AD- ok, I will respect that even if I disagree.
Dr Brown- Below is what I shared yesterday:
"I would like to have a positive and constructive discussion about the goals of this meeting, scope of the discussion, relevant participants, expected
deliverables, how we plan to use them. "
How can we do this 1-1, or with Dr Brown before we meet? We only have today and tomorrow.
AAU- I will do that today. Thanks for the reminder.
Arm- must have really been a soft tissue strain. He should have been in a sling. I did not know it was still an issue and was focused on the cold.

An RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified.
I am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any violation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I
would hope you received same guidance.
For Dr Brown, we will need to align here.
She asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me.
My goal is to update of situation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will
consider. We all have a different perspective on what occurred. Impact to Adrian and me was/is real. I am not going to brush aside Adrian’s concerns
that he expressed to me.
I’d like to confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we loose the spot and it gets pushed out further.

It's unfortunate we still have to try and solve complex muti-topic issues this way post a new RO.
Hope to make my point constructively here. But I will be honest and forthcoming and hope you see this as a constructive response and not a
personal attack.
An RO was filed that restricts communications until it is modified. I am going to be very respectful of the legal system and not be a party to any
violation. They do not look kindly on individuals that don’t do that. I would hope you received same guidance. 
<<You have been saying that the RO was filed for a couple of weeks. But we did what we needed to do to advance our issues. Now you won't and
have a sudden change of heart. You were going to work with Anna Lisa to modify the RO so we could be more effective, especially acknowledging the
need for our "Running List" format. None of that happened. We are not much better off today than two weeks ago. And even after trying to resolve it
at your request yesterday with haste, the "no upgrade" RO was filed.
Today- zero progress, nothing in sight. I realize this is not business, but know you are far more capable than this. If you were 90% blocked from
effectively doing your job, had been saying you would fix it for two weeks, came back and told Julie you didn't fix anything, you are still blocked but
will keep at it with no timeline or schedule even with all the help you can get, I don't see that flying tbh. I will be patient as I promised, but you
brought it up so just replying. >>
For Dr Brown, we will need to align here. She asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me. My goal is to update of
situation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will consider. We all have a different

to confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we lose the spot and it gets pushed out further. 
<<We do need to align. The only context she has to define her plan of action is your email. That's it. She has no idea who and why to involve in the
discussion and why? I would like to align, as I have mentioned from day one. Not just today, but every single day since this started. Only responding
to the 10th request a day or two before we do this is not grounds for saying "well it's too late, let's go with it." Further, this was about AD and I. That
is it. We both saw it and were never given a chance to discuss or explain.
So now we need to discuss reunification as a result and if we handle the situation in a way, healthiest for him. And what we should do in the future. It
is appropriate for those impacted by what AD saw- AD, Me, you, to have that conversation. No one else. This is not about relitigating something I
apologized for, and as you say, we both disagree on. Dr Brown should not be making that judgment. She is not qualified>>
A shared proposal I hope we can both get behind and work as a team:
- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.  
- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
we handled it. 
- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns. . 
- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting
plan if necessary.

- How We Use:  I'd like to agree here. Last time we paid for advice not adopted. For that matter, if we don't follow her advice, I'm not totally sure why
we are going back.
So I'll be patient as requested for the first issue. Especially since we are trying to make this issue work with OFW. But I'll continue to ask we resolve Dr
Brown before engaging.
These are sensitive matters that have a huge impact on the remains of what is left of the Moyer family. So I hope that was respectful and constructive.
If not, please advise
I'm still all in, and will continue to be. 

When you do, would you mind sharing our thoughts? It would be better to present our teamwork and cooperation rather than coming across as

Also, I don’t think the RO applies to you if you ever need me quickly. So just feel free to ring me or text me. I would hate to keep you waiting on an

Do you want me to take a!pass at the sass update?  As mentioned I’m not terribly familiar with his ICS experience, but I’ll be happy to take a go at it..

AD Questionnaire- I am going to stop errands and focus on finishing that with ICS so I can get it back to you with time for Lori to review if she likes.
SAAS meeting- Let's appear as healthy and well-adjusted as possible. We can do it here, but I need time to tidy. Obviolhs on best behavior.  Please

Court Filing- Hope we can do this soon. I am in a very uncomfortable state given this is in a live court filing. But I promised patience and will be.

Just some feedback, but some of this whole move thing is just mean. We don't have any idea who will end up where. Based on the last agreement we
had, I was going to be in the house- after I even offered to try and keep you there, but you refused.
And so much of this is junk. Stuff we should have done together when we both left the house. Now it fills three rooms, including the bedroom I had
hoped to make special for Max. That was super important to me. And now I can't even do that.
And then, some of the special things. Things that mean a lot to me are broken or f'd
- The "Microsoft" clay sculpture Elsa gave me 20 years ago
- The Allen field house floor I laid Adrian on when he was born
- Poppa's bible is all taken apart so I'll never know how he had it
- I can go on but won't
And then there are things I *thought* were us. Special things that I hoped we would wait to divvy up. It's all just thrown like trash in a bag.
We are trying to be kinder and accepting, and that's the most important thing now. But I needed to say something because this feels so rude.

Please see this mail from you -> me that includes your comments that I replied to.

- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
I realize we were discussing the value of Elsa with her limited information and non-participation in this but we were still going back and forth. We set
a time to work on it and you bailed.
I am happy to repeat my concerns again if I need to, but I offered an alternative plan. And at the end of the day, the Participants list that came FROM
YOU did not include Elsa. Period.
So while we might have been misaligned, I went with what you said. You can say "not cool" but I asked repeatedly if we were aligned so this DID
NOT happen. Blaming me is "not cool"

Happy to chat more, but for now I will remain positive and constructive as promised. I did nothing in my mind that was either nefarious or meant ill-

She does have a perspective. Based on a non-witness, non parent, and limited information. Remember she screamed at me for never apologizing to
you. I sent my apology three weeks ago. Is she qualified to give her opinion when she has no idea what the heck is going on?
I'll note that she also laid into me about screwing other women when we were married. She has no idea that started when you were 18 in Hong Kong,
we both participated and enjoyed it, but she only knows your side. Then there is her take on Kevin Otero and what you two did together.
I trust Elsa to make smart decisions and contribute constructively. She just needs the full and accurate picture. Otherwise, she will jump to incorrect
conclusions and be very opinionated. That feels like a commonsense requirement to provide testimony. How else would she be helpful?

narrative. So you will ignore it.
And if you are in control, why was the wrong RO filed?
You did that? So now we have actually been violating it on both sides all week. We can’t even do an “fyi” forward. We both broke the RO now. Zero
1-1’s
And why are you offering up something I have already signed. How does that make any sense. I already signed it. Thats being in control?
And you have zero idea about the discussion with Elsa. You have no clue what she said. About our swinging or what she told me about you and
Kevin.
I’m going to stop. I promised to be helpful, not attack even in the face of accusations and insults. I am really trying, Christine. I’m not going to stop.
Please consider I listened to you. I don’t know why you started hating on me tonight, all I know is you spoke with the person who can’t file the right
RO.
Can we please go back to working towards a common goal and quit trying so hard to destroy me? I honestly loved you more than life itself. And I’m
trying.

You know I went back and read what I’ve been saying to you over the last few days. I looked at my tone. I looked at my cooperation, and I looked to
see if I was manipulating you.
I honestly hope you will take a moment and just review some of the things that I was trying to do. I hope that you’ll step back and look objectively at
our communications.
I know you see me as some sort of evil villain, but I’m not, I don’t know why you interpret everything I do is some plot to abuse you. that is not my
intent at all in this relationship
I’m honestly and sincerely trying to listen to you while you are still my wife and be the man you are telling me I need to be for you. I’m doing this for
our children and our mental health.
I’ve been saying since July, just tell me what I did wrong. You don’t have to hate me so much, Christine I am not doing anything with malice or hate
towards you. Please see our threads.
I’m at a loss now on how to behave or what you want from me. It feels like nothing I do is right, no matter how hard I try. I don’t know why you can’

When it needed your updates, I did the same. I wanted to show you we could do something good together.
Please don’t find a reason not to do it.
Please provide a reason for us to partner.
It could make all the difference someday.
Message 1252 of 4024
I truly appreciate the speed and attention you made to the responses and questions. I input into the system as it was first requirement for the
preliminary application but I have been unable to submit it. I’m going to ask why on the call.
I hope you have seen me move forward in the other front for teacher evaluation and transcripts with similar urgency.
Agree that when we do partner together it can result in real synergies.
My hesitation is based on years of lived experience that I am only just unpacking. Anytime I would show or demonstrate a willingness to forgive,
move on, forget etc, it is rewarded briefly (days, weeks, sometimes months) with improved situation, but things have inevitably fallen back to
behaviors that have been traumatizing, scary, disrespectful etc. often times my accepting behavior is then weaponized against me in the most
humiliating or embarrassing way, to demonstrate my weakness or lack of judgment.
I fully expect this to happen in our mediation and future interactions, so I am in a position that I can’t respond in ways I used to. It does not serve me
well.
I don’t expect you to understand but that’s my explanation whether you accept or agree with it.

I am trying to make the change, but if you do not give me an opportunity to show you that, it will never happen. And we are doomed to this life of

I just got it. Since it is not filed, can we at least make some basic changes? Even the stuff we are doing on email now is not allowed.
Someone always has to be on the mail for you and I to swap them. So we can’t just share basic information about our own kids.
And honestly, it would be better if we could have a running list format. We can start with something very small but effective.
It’s not going to get filed today anyway, so can we please consider it? It’s gonna cost a lot more money to make it right in the future.

Please stop sending all the family memories. I keep asking, you say sorry. And then another box lands. Please stop... I’m hoping at some point our
whole life is not devoid of any memories together. It will be a shame to teach the kids that.
And thank you for the original blink cameras . As mentioned, we bought the black Blink cameras for the outdoors, the white Blink cameras for the
indoors, and then I gave you the ring camera as a Christmas present. You have now found all the cameras we bought years ago now. This is what I
said.
I admitted I swapped them before this mess. You clearly put the old ones away, so knew we had them. The new ones were in plain view, never hidden.
And in the same place. May we please step back and consider you might have known about them? You put them away with your own hands.
Please see attached. There is one, that went above the door. It still has the same mount on it that was used to put it in the same holes that the Comcast
cams used. The other has no mount. It was never mounted. It sat pointing at the door as a deterrent. You sent what I said we had for years.
I am not looking to start an argument, or re-litigate. I am simply pointing out that this is my exact explanation. And if you did not know about them,
that’s fine. But note you put them in bags and put them away. And now you sent them back to me.
If this doesn’t make sense, I’m happy to explain. But you get the point. We bought them years ago. You packed them away. And here they are. I have
not been lying. They are on my coffee table now. Please consider my explanation again given this.

I can certainly try and find more info. Of course! I’m happy to try and figure that out. But I admit that I did the swap. That is not even a debate. I did
that.
I thought where we were hung up was the idea that the originals never exist existed, and you did not know. But here they are. And you put them
away.
I really don’t want to fight. I will look. But they did exist. And whether you remember or not, you did at some point come into physical contact with
them.
So that part of the entire story (and Elsa laying into me about them not existing) doesn’t appear to be accurate. We have to acknowledge at least that.
The other thing we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt is- they DONT work in the garage. It’s not possible. No need to debate it. We can see.
I can also show you that if you go out of WiFi, they stop. Come back in they connect, just like your laptop does. No intervention is needed. It’s called
“retry”
We don’t need to debate. It is all provable. We could do it tonight. I should have said something that night. I know that. I’m sorry. But I was not
spying.

I am Adrian’s Dad. I want to demonstrate  I support him and be in his corner. I don’t want this to be an “All Mom” thing.
We agreed to do this together. When he is present, let’s do it together. We can accommodate for him.
You will not be alone with me. Let’s show him that when he is involved, we put our adult stuff aside.

Your Ask:
Robert (cc'd) and I are aligned that it would be very helpful to engage your assistance in navigating this sensitive area involving surveillance activities
and monitoring. Robert and I have a different perspective on what unfolded and can share in our discussions. Our lawyers are also aligned with this
proposed approach on how we might address this issue in relation to the parenting plan. Our proposal would be to schedule a conversation with our
youngest son Adrian to share his experience and impact to him, potentially our oldest daughter Elsa, myself and Robert.
Our Ask:
- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.
- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
way we handled it.
- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our
parenting plan if necessary.
- How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being
formally approved. So TBD.
Dr Brown did not seem to do this at all. In any way. Either one of our asks above. I assume this was not a bait and switch, but the intent was clearly to
address Adrian's reaction to the cam incident and how we reunify safely and healthily.
So now I guess we will never address the cam, how we handled it, and when I can see our son. Given this was your idea, I want to work with you since

Adrian shared what he witnessed with Dr. Brown, impact and as I understand what he feels needs to happen to earn trust etc.
She is scheduling time with you and I separately but indicated that surveillance activities are highly concerning and meet the threshold for DV.
I know you are contesting the surveillance but understanding consequences and long term impact are something I am uncertain you have fully

This OFW thing is fine for settled business. When you need to swap pick up plans. What we are trying to do right now is way bigger, and will have a

Please consider a one time peaceful discussion. I’d be happy to go for a walk, do teams, or phone call. I know we have things we need to work around,
but we could do the Bellevue park circle or a place of your choosing. Whatever works.
But we are kidding ourselves that this format will do us any justice at all. We know it does not work. Let’s try something that has for us in the past.
Hell. I even sold and bought a house in one day after one of our more contentious walks!
In my mind we really are not far apart. Mainly because I’m willing to do whatever you like to feel comfortable. I’m honestly open to ideas and trust
“most” of your judgement. We have been through the wringer. Let’s compromise.
Let’s take this back. I showed last week I’m done fighting. Let’s start putting our energy into healthy kids, your job, and my job search. We really don’t
need to wake up to ground hog day with every sunrise. I am dying for normalcy.
You said you’d consider it. Let’s do it. I know you well enough to believe in you. And I just need a shot to show you who I am now. What we’re doing
is not working. The kids need healthy parents. Let’s just do it. If we miss failure, we can always do this again.

He asked if he can come over to watch the Super Bowl tomorrow. He is dying to see the house he chose, furnished. Both the boys are pleasers so he

Given that he wants it. Dr Brown will not offer an opinion, and there is no harm that will come from it, would you mind asking him like you did for
the Alabama game? I trust that you will do it in a way that makes him feel comfortable. I trust you completely.
Given zero help from Dr Brown except for her helpful insight for me. That I will take to heart and find healthy moments to explore his concerns, I
think we are kind of now at a point where you and I need to decide. And possession is 9/10 of the law.
So I’d like to have him over. The alternative is pick some random date in the next few weeks when nothing has changed. It will be like all of last month

comfortable I will be here. I am their dad, and I’m always there for them.
So with that, I assume there is no longer a need for a parenting plan. If I’m fighting so hard to see them but they don’t want to see me, it doesn’t make
any sense. I can’t force them to love me, so I’m going to stop.
I assume that will end 90% of our fights and give you what you want (and actually have already taken) I hope I did that in a healthy way. Everything
changed when you said AD doesn’t want to be with me.

Hey!
Hope you are having a good day and starting the week on your front foot. Just wanted to touch base given a long list of things (mostly kid related

So, in the spirt of healthy cooperation I’ll send one more to see if you would like to - continue using OFW despite it not working, arrange for a way to
peacefully communicate, or move to expensive lawyers.
I am trying hard to recognize your concerns and anticipate a response of “it’s too much to even reply”. But I am using OFW as asked, and when you

I anticipate a response that it’s all my fault. That’s fine. It is. Our entire marriage was my fault, the kids are my fault, and we never had a nice day in 29

So.... I’m asking in a hopeful way in the spirt of healthy co-parents, how we communicate moving forward. The prescribed method isn’t  working and

Thank you for the prompt and kind reply.
I can start list and share beforehand. My concern is for some of these things we could spend 20 minutes talking to reach an agreement or a week going
back and forth here. For each of ~five issues?
It’s not meant to be a criticism but a simple acknowledgement that when four hours pass before you can afford a reply, an exchange that should take
5-10 minutes usually takes more than 5-10 hours.
My hope is we can:
- Start with a list here (OFW)
- Both share our thoughts (email?)
- Agree to discuss peacefully (tbd?)
- Peacefully agree/disagree
- Document our decisions (OFW)
- Expedite our existing backlog
If we can agree, I will start the list today. We can swap our first thoughts (it would be far easier in email for inline comments?). And then have our 1-1
meeting together on Wednesday evening.

My hope is we will give this one shot to have a talk, never to be repeated if it does not work. My aspiration is it will work, we show grace, resolve our
issues, and establish a blueprint for success.
I’m honestly, and sincerely trying to work with you, Christine. This is not an attempt to manipulate you. It is trying to dig us out of our hole, resolve
big issues, and move forward peacefully with less expense.
Thanks for your thoughtful consideration...

Of course. I want to do the right thing and so do you. I am happy to start the list here as asked.
Here is what the RO says now:
- The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as
specifically permitted, below:
- The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard
solely for the purpose of co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding
management of shared assets.
- The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in
communications with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or
managing the parties’ shared assets.
As I read this, you have no restrictions on communicating with me. The RO just limits how I contact you.  It also does not prohibit face-to-face
interactions- school events, sports, or a constructive discussion walk or coffee.
Do you read the text above the same way? I just want to be sure we are on the same page before I spend a considerable amount of time documenting
everything with the expectation that we will resolve anything on OFW again.
My fear is that will lead to the same frustration that inspired this ask. My hope is you will exercise your rights so we can work together instead of going
in a circle by kicking off another round of what has always failed as noted below.
I will start the list and share it here. May I also ask you let me know if you will consider my proposal for a one-time, peaceful and constructive all-up

Message 1337 of 4024
Totally... any chance we can do that today? Respectfully, of course, this discussion has been going on for weeks  and I'd like to start an inline
discussion tomorrow. I assure you I am NOT coming off the rails. Last week's ask of me is the way I plan to live my life from now on.
Just as an FYI below. It should be a pretty simple, straightforward turnaround for Anna Lisa.
The language provided in the restraining order (RO) specifically addresses restrictions on the "Restrained Person" regarding communication with the
"Protected Person." The terms of a restraining order are directed at the behavior of the restrained person to protect the safety and well-being of the
protected person. It does not impose reciprocal restrictions on the protected person's actions unless specified by the court in a mutual restraining
order.
Here’s how the outlined conditions generally apply:
1. **Restrictions on the Restrained Person**: The detailed conditions explicitly limit how the restrained person can communicate with the protected
person. These limitations are in place to prevent unwanted or potentially harmful interactions, while still allowing necessary communication for co-
parenting or managing shared assets through specified channels.
2. **Lack of Mention of Restrictions on the Protected Person**: The text does not mention any restrictions on the protected person’s behavior. This
is consistent with the purpose of a restraining order, which is to protect one party from the actions of another. However, the protected person is
typically not prevented from contacting the restrained person unless they also have a restraining order against them or there are specific court orders
to that effect.
If both parties need or want to modify the communication terms of the RO—for example, to allow more flexibility or to impose certain restrictions
on the protected person as well—it's essential to do so through the court. Any changes to the terms of a restraining order must be approved by a judge
to be legally enforceable.
In any situation involving a restraining order, consulting with a legal professional can provide guidance tailored to the specifics of the case, including
any questions about communication rights and restrictions for both parties.

Time & Date in screenshot
Side note... I hope this doesn’t push buttons because it should put you ease. Obviously ADs screen time is more intrusive than the things we had set
up for us.
We had simple things like “joined the network” for anyone (Elsa, Christina, Ms Stephanie... etc) and it never said anyone’s name in the actual alert.
BUT if you drilled into it you could kinda figure it out by looking at the device name- “Ms. Stephanie’ iPhone” and triangulating on the time it fired.
This (when we were a family) was important. You want to know if people are on your family’s network. They can do bad things to work laptops, kids
stuff, etc...
When I was in the fold, I tried hard to keep us all safe. Just like you file our taxes. We did what we know how to do as in an effort to keep the Moyer’s
humming.
BUT!!! The big takeaway for you, is there were NEVER indoor cams. This hint is enough to infer things. So please know your privacy was NEVER
invaded.
I will swear that’s true on my children’s life, Christine.
I don’t want to hurt you. I still love you more than life.

It’s not a number. That’s either an sms or mms. This is an iOS alert. Just like with the “you know what”incident. Xfinity brokers that handshake with
Apple.
It has nothing to do with ATT. Neither did the other. And it is frustrating. Apple iOS sees a trigger in the cloud and pumps it out to my MAC
address.
Stuff happens in the service and even I don’t always grok the trigger. But in both cases, we know what made those fire. We just don’t know how to
stop it.
It’s not going to kill us as long as I don’t go to jail or loose future employability for it. So as long as we agree I can even stop putting myself in danger.
Just let me know. This is obviously one of the running list items I realized should go through Lisa, but felt like you and I could potentially just
cooperate on.
I want to get back to a place of trust with you. But till then, with Anna Lisa in play, it’s very scary to me. I’ll follow your lead, Christine and hope for
the best.

Sorry... I could have been more helpful but did not want to ruin a positive conversation with you.
Now that you have taken the reigns of the Network, however, you see all the stuff I used to see.  It is not intentional, you don't always understand it,
but unwelcome alerts pop up on your phone. I know, it happened to me all the freaking time.
The good news is that Samsung is likely a TV that was out of Wi-Fi range and conditions changed (a door that is usually closed is left open) or it has
not been turned on in a long while (maybe the TV in the man cave?). Then it reconnects, then you get an alert.
The good news is to join the network, it had to have a password at some point. And maybe this was just a TV that has not been joined since you
changed the WiFI name? That can happen. So it's annoying for sure, but probably safe, and not nefarious.
So as mentioned, if you let me know next time, I can teach you how to open an alert, investigate what it is, and have some peace of mind that it should
be there. Some android devices are no help, but Samsung usually has the metadata you need.
Alternatively, perhaps I can screen record simulating the same situation on my phone and share it with you. A picture is worth a thousand words, so a
video is probably worth a book. Divorce is the worst time to have this kind of alert crap happening.

This helps us out by:
- Allowing you to inspect where the boys may eventually spend the night
- Letting you mock and criticize my taste in my "man decor" furnishings
- Permitting me to cook for someone for the first time in six long months
- Gives us time to actually have potentially game-changing conversations
- Providing an environment more personal, where body language matters
- Giving you an out to walk away if I ever, in any way make you uncomfortable
- Perhaps kindling a blueprint for the way the kids could see us in the future
- Ending the catch 22 where we can't see each other ... because we don't now
I already know you have reservations (with me on Wed.. lol ) But I am asking you to be brave, take a chance, and let me show you I am the husband
you can trust and who has listened and applied your feedback. If I can't show you, we will be stuck here forever.

Obviously, a week back you said: "Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or
emails and texts as it is demonstrated they have been ugly, tone is confrontational, scary etc. nothing in recent history demonstrates that will change. I
am open to your suggestion."
I hope that the offer still stands. AND I hope I have shown a trend toward cooperation and peace, communicating in a way that puts you at ease. My
suggested updates to the RO are still valid and will afford us to be much more effective than the current way (which has me re-sending this mail from

can use Devan? It's worth a look since it is SO much easier the Craigslist. I'm going to start there from now on.
Have a great day!!!

So... why don't we try an icebreaker on Saturday? Let's look at stuff together.
We both have reasonably good taste. We can bounce thoughts off each other. And it gives us something very non-controversial to accomplish
something together.
Drop AD of after the game, let's meet at the Starbucks next door. And let the good times roll. We gotta start somewhere. This could not be a better,
easier, safer, baby step. Let's do it!

So it might be time to step back from this. It is not working. I appreciate the civility we have shared over the last ten days, but the reality is we are not
one task closer to solving anything. And you don't reach out with the smallest olive branch to communicate with me, even with the last
obstacle cleared by Anna Lisa. I don't anticipate any change. It is an established pattern, and I was misguided to think you might find the time or
energy but I am still glad I tried.
Because it's not about the RO. Has little to do with emails, texts, or calls. Or the fact that Xfinity spams me with alerts even after you took
responsibility a month ago. It's not about you attesting that I have and will beat you to the police. Or that you have five registered audio/video devices
that can drop in on my most private moments going back to my beach days. Or even Dr Brown's crazy misguided off-target effort that includes no
reunification agenda. It is about the barriers.
See, those are just bumps in the road. Hindrances to the singular thing that matters. And that is if you believe our boys are better off without me. You
have wiped me, and our memories from the house. I assume you would format their brains if you could. And if by whatever means possible, believe
they should have me separated from their existence all altogether. This, all after the best spring and summer we could ever have had together.  
You are omnipotent in this system and your actions demonstrate that eliminating a strong, sober, father figure is your desire. It is not a priority for our
boys to have a biological father as a role model or a positive force in their lives, teaching them lessons learned and passing on wisdom from my failures.
After banishing all positive memories perhaps, you will replace me soon. And with each passing day, it becomes their new narrative, engrained more
deeply, 
I acknowledge the challenges I have introduced into our lives, and I understand the expectation was for me to have navigated my childhood based on
an innate moral compass and not pass anything I learned along. But now the question comes down to redemption and healing. And is that something
we should foster in these young men? Will it serve them better to face the past, do the work, and heal or should they continue down the path of
alienation and punishment?  
Your stance suggests a preference for moving on without addressing the potential for reconciliation and growth. But this overlooks the essence of my
attempts to communicate and reintegrate into our sons' lives, aiming to contribute positively to their development into resilient and capable
individuals. You may see it just as "robert wants to text or call... no way" but it misses the point. I'm trying to knock down obstacles that keep us from
addressing the issues. 
So as another day passes, you sign on for five minutes, spraying a couple of responses before going dark for the next five hours, only to rinse and repeat
twice more before you shut down, I urge you to reflect on the deeper reasons behind my persistence. I am striving to dismantle the barriers preventing
our sons' healing. Please consider if it might be worth taking a moment from Starbucks or your social life, and sitting down to discuss our path

forward for Max and AD. 
And selfishly I also want to have some normalcy again. I want to be civil with you. I want to be able to have coffee or share a meal and a laugh. I want
to look for a job in earnest. I see a ton at Microsoft I want to apply for these days. But I am not going to do any of that till we have a clear and
confirmed glide path for our future. It's just too volatile and I am not going to put another moment into pretending I can ignore my kids and focus
on finding a new job. 
I'm also done writing these... I am done begging you to work with me. They take time, thought, and energy and it's insanity to think they matter. On
the best day, I'll get a "thank you for the time, I'll come back to this" or "thanks for appreciating I'm not ready to talk to you" or "I get too anxious to
discuss this with you". So please don't candy-coat another reason not to invest time and energy into what should be the most important thing in the
Moyer family's life.
That said, I will continue to work positively with you if you find time and motivation. Stop my job search. And work with Lisa when I have issues.
Thanks again. Wish this had worked.
And on perhaps our last Valentine's Day as a married couple, which I thought would last forever, I'll note one final time- Christine, you are now and
will always be my queen. I love you.

I understand your intent of this message. I also am not sure you realize the trauma and chaos that has been introduced. We were on a path that got
derailed.
You have a story now that you will stick to. Our reality and impact is very different. You have not even reached out to Dr Brien to schedule time.
I see the discussion of stopping a job search as interesting, almost a veiled threat but that’s on you. You’ve know you would be without a job for a year
now. As I’ve busted myself in my role in the craziness chaos, somehow that’s fine for me to do and expected as I’ve done that for 25 years, but for you
that’s impossible. So be it.
My reality of health kids job is all consuming and I don’t have time to craft emails such as below and get criticized when I’m short.
I’ve tried for months and months to move this forward, and have been derailed on so many occasions. To be accused of not putting energy is
maddening.
So as I respond to this, going to be late for breakfast, make lunch, both kid drop off, work back to back meetings, kid pick up, meeting, another kid
pick up, evening call and work, perhaps I should just say, hey, it’s just too much so I’ll just not do it.

I think this is devolving into a fight. I have no interest in that. I don't care to refute or discuss a point-by-point rebuttal. My commitment to peaceful

I want to acknowledge what you are saying below. Every point. In fact, I am trying very hard to discuss them with you so acrimony does not fester
and deepen by swapping arrows on OFW.
I appreciate your perspective and hope you honor mine by finding time to discuss these for the greater good. But that is not happening. And there is
neither a path forward nor progress.
I would love, love, love to help you share your burden. We can talk and discuss what that would need to look like. But not allowing that to happen
effectively eliminates all chance of that.
It is said that "Amidst the storm of disagreement, the gentle breeze of kind and constructive communication navigates us towards the shores of

Of course... may I kindly suggest an agenda for Sat?
- Meet at Bellevue Starbucks for Decaf- 5:00 pm
- Stroll the Bellevue consignment store- 5:15-5:45 pm
- Visit the “Boy Crib” to get you thoughts- 6:00 pm
- Allow me to prepare a yummy menu- 6:15 pm
- Eat delicious food made with love- 6:45 pm
- Discuss big picture or line items- 7:00 pm
This allows us to slowly, gently, ease into our discussion in a constructive and respectful way. Establish an amicable report, while not being forced
into the ring, bloodied with backs against the wall.
If you feel threatened or I am being unreasonable, you bail. Just like you can hang up or block me. I am strongly incentivized to make this singular
opportunity work, lest we keep this up for months on end.
But... before you say “no” again, please reflect on the status quo, its impact on all of us, and consider that we will never break the cycle till we make an
effort to break the cycle. Again, we are living a catch 22.
So I ask this one time, and perhaps the only time since our anniversary before you left for home, that you will allow me to, not manipulate you, but
instead offer a different solution than what’s not working.
Please put your sword and shield aside. Rearrange plans as I will do, and make this our singular priority for a couple of hours on the singular date/time
you are not all consumed with competing priorities.
You’re still in control, but relax and enjoy the ride...
Take a chance. You won’t be disappointed you did.

It might be a little. But we can discuss. Dr Brown not only did not do what was outlined. She went further to say she is specifically avoiding doing
that. Given it was your suggestion, and I wanted to work with you, I agreed. I think that was fair. But it’s so far off the rails I have not destination even
in sight.
And I agree that it was traumatizing. It was for you and I both as well. But you and I have been given a small chance at least to discuss. We still disagree
but we can be civil and even see each other. AD has not had that opportunity. He is shut out of both an explanation or what I have apologized for.
The net is it continues to fester. The fact that he can’t get a reasonable explanation from his father just reinforces the idea it was nefarious. I know you
are doing what you think is right, but shutting out one whole side of the story and allowing him to draw his own conclusions seems
counterproductive.
Let’s shine some light on this and let him decide.
Dr Brown has no intention of helping the situation.

Please re-read Dr Brown’s mail. It says exactly what I described below. She called it a grey area that she is going to avoid. That is super easy to
understand.
I don’t link her to Yurushka. She had an obligation to talk to you. It’s probably an oath they take?
But she did not have an obligation to say she did not talk to you, when she did.
If this was a police investigation do you really think that would fly? Hell no. She said she did not and did.
None of this matters. If I’m wrong, juts copy paste her plan to address the detailed request we made.

I propose we save the cycles, step away, and focus back on the fact that we need to have a way to work constructively together. Our catch-22’

First, because this is the 3rd time I have had to type this up because OFW sucks. But it’s all I have.
Second, I have no idea what is going on with my account or the Kirkland Xfinity account now.
I am getting all sorts of alerts from App Access to Credit Cards. I don't know what security layers you have now or what might have changed. I just
know my info is passed around on that network and now I am getting constant warnings and security alerts.
We never had this issue before, so I'm bummed it's exploding now. The net is if we can't figure it out, I need to get any of my info that flows through
your network removed- Kill Max's long time game account, kill all credit card info, kill and game pass connection.
And frankly, that is just to protect me. You can make your own decisions about what you are prepared to put on that network, from all of the above
to your confidential emails and even your every keystroke for that matter. You are in the same boat.
I am not trying to finger-point. I bummed this is happening, but its not your area. I don't expect you to understand. And I am sure that if I did our

Just answering your questions. I don't care to fight.
For that matter. Given your reaction this morning, I want to respect your position and don't care to communicate much anymore. You said we both
wanted peace and explained what it would take to get to normalcy. I tried for almost two weeks, and you were mostly pleasant in OFW for which I
appreciate. But we got nothing done, no olive branch, and today we only got worse. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy kicking the football. You can
Google it...
But you asked about the cams that you sent over with the exact same mounts (one single, one none) you said you never knew existed and if they did,
you never knew about them. I won't disagree with you. I just saw you had packed them away and eventually sent them to me. I won't confirm or deny
you knew of them. You just handled them. I gave you the ring for xmas. I did not install it. The others were set up but were not reliable or all that
useful. We took the white indoor cams down, you put the away, but left the outdoor cams up as a deterrent.
- Sending a pic of the Amazon purchase before Xmas in 2020. Install date is unknown tbh.
- Sharing a pic of the outdoor cams, please note how the mounts match the newer ones.
At the risk of repeating myself, I am not saying you knew but you asked two questions I'd like to offer my thoughts on.
One: "If we had them, why didn't I have the Blink App installed?"
I don't know. If you say you never installed it I believe you. I had it, they did a shitty job so perhaps we stopped using them before you even needed to.

You never installed the Beach Cams either. But I had shared them with you (indoor and outdoor) and knew those worked, but never installed the app
for those.
That said, you also never installed:
- Nest App- It works well, you are aware of it, and never installed it, but ask me to use it for you.
- Sleep Number App- It is also helpful but you never installed it. But maybe just did not need to.
- Frame Apps- We had them in the living room and used them daily. You choose not to install.
- Samsung App- It sets the picture you see in the cat room and bedroom. You did not install.
- Alexa- You still have several cam/audio devices that can drop in on me. Not sure what's up.
When we were a loving couple doing our own thing, lots of times I would be geeked out on something, you would smile and nod, feign interest but
not really act. That was normal.
Two: "If we had them, I would have remembered them?"
I don't have any reason to believe you would not, so this may be true too. And I won't fight if you really believe that you have no memory of that. I
will say that we do forget things sometimes, however. Everyone does.
This could be a long list, but you will get the point:
Carbon Monoxide Detector- I made a pretty big deal of this, explaining that I always am sure to take them on vacation with us. I talked about why I
do that and all the crazy AirBnB stories that made me scared. I wanted to protect our family and noted that I would be taking it to protect your
brother along with Justin and Josh. For some reason, it was being used as a WiFi repeater in your clear line of the site where you spend hours every
week. Maybe you forgot?
Private Moments- I asked you recently if you remember our Hyatt stay. You didn't. This surprised me. It was one of the few times we made time for
an overnight together. In the end, we bickered on the way home, but that night, and especially the morning, was an all-time great freaking sweaty, sexy
time. WOW!! And.. we took crazy explicit pics of you. By far the hardest core thing we ever did. Face and all. I won't attach pics. I would think you
would remember, but don't.
My point is everyone forgets things but believes they are absolutely in command of the facts. I have even watched Netflix documentaries on it. It is
called the "eyewitness memory distortion " effect. It's a fascinating human phenomenon and it's super interesting to see it broken down and explained.
That said, who knows, maybe I did not even mention it to you. I may be guilty of the same thing and thought I told you but didn't. But like the
"Alexa drop in" we used often at times; it was just normal when we were a happy family. We did not think of it as spying.
This is of course equally true of:
- Our shared ATT family plan
- Parental control for the kids
- Screen time alerts for the kids
- New device joining Xfinity alerts
I don't really care about what the Luddites in the family law world or the perversion of good intentions into bad, that this has become. When we were
a happy family, this was all approved, discussed, and, welcomed. Protecting your kids in the real world is expected. And phone bills have had call/text
history since long before cell phones even existed.
You didn't ask about things rejoining the network today or about alerts that pop like Blink did. But you have seen them with Samsung Alerts. So, at a
minimum, you have to realize this is a true and demonstratable network phenomenon. I can also prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the cams DO
NOT work in the places you saw them, in the open, pointing at exterior doors.
At this point, I have digressed. But you asked two questions about the cams, and I wanted to give you, my thoughts. If in reading this, you think that
it is simply impossible that what I am saying could ever be true, that's you right. I am only offering my true and honest perspective on the event that
has traumatized you, because I never had any desire to surveil you.... ever.
As mentioned, many times before I am happy to prove this to you in front of your eyes. I have also told you that I bought the new ones at the

Northgate Target and the Blink account was deleted when I realized what it was doing. I wish I could have shown you everything the moment I
realized this was happening when I cam over the next day. But we are where we are.
Maybe someday we come to terms with all this, but I'm not hopeful anymore. No dialog or shared exchange of perspectives will only entrench and
increase the hate for one another.

I appreciate you responding to my questions below with that level of detail.
One thing that really jumped out for me, and now I am terrified of, given the volatility of the situation, and past threats, is mention of explicit pictures

So... I wanted to let you know after I sent this.
I destroyed all the face, tattoo pics and couple of years ago. You were my wife. I had the real thing whenever I wanted. And I wanted to protect you.
Hacking happens (juts like the last few days) I would never let my Queen be tarnished.They have been long gone.
I will also delete the anonymous ones. I have not looked at them in two years.I have no issues with that. I do want the undie ones that don’t show
anything more than your amazing body and what anyone would see at the beach. Let me know if that is an issue. I’d like those maybe?
What forms and options are you reading about how to come after me if I may ask? I’m not doing any of that. I’m trying to focus on improving us but
you won’t I guess maybe I should stop and light a fire with Lisa. Tell her we need to stop playing nice and start preparing for a frontal assault because
my efforts to heal wounds and co-parent are in vain.
My hope was we could work this out and move on with grace and respect, but not a single hope has materialized. You say I have, and will beat my kids
again. Realistically I assume you might say anything. Perhaps sexual molestation is next. It would be just as true as me beating them and pack an even
more lethal punch for ya.
I have zero desire to cause you harm. I have shown that. I never surveilled you but you won’t even consider if what I have said could even possibly be
true. And it definitely can and I can show you. But you refuse to even watch a real life demonstration. You seem dead set on not even considering an
alternative explanation for the cams or the physical abuse claims you levied against me.
In your heart. Like really deep down below all the hate and willful destruction you have for me, you know, the kids know, the world knows I never
beat you or my kids. To sign your name on a legal document saying that is nuts. Yet that is what you have alleged to god and everyone, including the
courts and police. You don’t think that perhaps, at this point you and Anna Lisa have taken my persecution too far yet?

molestation eventually. As you might do soon. It took years, jail time, and drug the children through hell. And it all never happened. Ot destroyed
innocent lives. But apart from sex abuse, we are no different. It’s playing out the exact same way so far.
And please, don’t act like you are not capable of that. It’s insulting to us both with your signature sitting on a legal document with the court and
police department alleging that I beat my family. It’s just the other side of the same coin you have already used.

My point was sometimes we think we remember big things. But we don’t. That seems bigger than just the cams around the house when all was good.

As an FYI-
Sharing two of the live cams you have had in my place since the beach days. You also had one on your desk but not sure what it was used for, but
know it acts as the receiver for watching video and listening for audio. I didn't know about them so moved them from Alki to Bellevue thinking they
were innocent. I still assume they are, but want to confirm.
But both have drop-in enabled. So as we have done so many times in the past, you can just "drop in" unannounced and see and hear everything that
goes on in the most private spaces of my home, not outside in public view where the expectation of privacy is far different. These were great when we
needed them for a quick check in on the kids.
Then of course, a bunch more (registered to you, again) came over recently that if I plug in, can also monitor audio and video via drop-in. That is
actually how I found out about the other two that were in my place for who knows how long. I drilled into who they were currently registered to and
what they were capable of.

I want to be helpful and hope after all of this mess on my, you are not using these "drop-in" devices for anything nefarious. Or trying to sneak in new
digital trojan horses, but you see what I see and have shared. So, they could all be used to spy on me if you want, its just a question of if you are using
them. And again- I honestly do not think you are.
This was one of the core reasons I tried to open a dialog with you this week. It is in the emails I sent and on the list you asked me to document of
things to discuss. I don't believe this is intentional, especially after all we have struggled with in this area. And that's why I wanted it to stay between
us. I totally give you the benefit of the doubt here.
So let me know how would like to proceed given we can't communicate peacefully. I still want to resolve this constructively, but I'm stuck between a
rock and a hard place if I can't even talk to you about it. And I am NOT making any threats. I am NOT coming after you for cameras in my place. I
am looking to resolve this and prefer not to go through attorneys.
Can you let me know your thoughts? If you go dark, I'll assume you are going straight to Anna Lisa instead of working with me. I hope that is not the
case for the aforementioned reasons. I honestly believe this is an innocent mistake we can just resolve. I can even talk you through "unregistering"
them so you can't drop in on me anymore!
Let's please use common sense and just let me help... This is a super easy fix for us.
We can be civil one last time before we burn the bridge behind us. Just let me know!

Please don't go there. That is not fair to me. I would have parted the Red Sea for you and the boys and was fast on the path to self-improvement with
your blessing and approval. There is literally nothing in my life I would not have changed for you.
If you had got off that plane from Hong Kong and said "Robert, I am serious as a heart attack. I know it appears that we are doing our best ever, and
you may think you are making improvements, but none of it is good enough. Period. I realize now that this is a five-alarm fire. I did not before. So I
am putting you on notice. You need to listen to my concerns and put something in place that salvages our family after years of destruction.
Otherwise, I am walking."
And if you want to know the truth, Christine, I might still be open to it. Even with all that has happened. I don't want the Moyers to blow up. Or
leave a man behind. I want to fix it, more than ever. With the knowledge and wisdom of past mistakes so that we can all thrive together.

told Debbie. Even after we all agreed in our counseling that I needed to move on and make “new traditions” for us.
This was so predictable. It’s the logical path you choose as soon as you met Yurushka. I said it then, I have said it many times since, and I’ll say it again

I agree that we need a parenting plan ASAP. Most of the disagreements we have are related to being able to spend time with my family. I also have a

If you have decided you can’t look for gainful employment, that is a choice you have made. The relationship with Max is a direct consequence of your
interactions with him. I can go on. Putting blame on me for your situation is again a choice you are making.
A theme that has been recurring in your life has been its always someone else’s fault for your woes and resulting behavior that results, your
upbringing, your mom, your dad, your boss, the therapists, and now you have trained it squarely on me as the reason for all things bad.
It’s certainly one way to go through life if that’s worked for you. The past 25 years, I pushed forward inspite of what was happening. I could have
easily taken the same approach but I didn’t.  I’m going to continue that approach but have also pivoted to not accept actions towards me that are
completely unacceptable and will not sweep things under the rug. That did not serve me well and I finally woke up to that.
Actions have consequences which you have never fully felt, and are understandably jarred that you are being held accountable.
Everything that took a turn was a result of some action taken. Perhaps that is the connection you are not making. What was the action that caused the
reaction? Things just don’t happen out of the blue.

It’s really ironic, right? You ignore the entire email and tell me I’m all about blaming other people. As you of course blame me for all this. Your entire

Sometimes I’m surprised at the absolute hypocrisy of your life and philosophy, but I shouldn’t be. It’s so consistent it should never surprise me.
And no, this did happen out of the blue. You might have had an epiphany but a successful married is about communication. You just bailed.

So.... What’s next? Just go back into our bunker and lob bombs?
I spent two weeks hearing:
“thank you for the thoughtful effort”
“I appreciate the positive tone today”
“If patient I’ll come back this afternoon”
      .... Crickets...
But I’m sure you were doing the best you could. I realize this is hard for you. But we are never going to agree on perspectives so the question is do we
accept that, learn how to be nice given that, and try to be kind and constructive.
I’d like a dialog, but I’d like some commitment and follow. I hope that is reasonable. I really just wish we were not set up to hate each other for profit
by others since August. But we are where we are. Hope they enjoy the new hot-tub.
What would you like to do? This is not working and saying that every day seems dumb to both of us.

The divorce is happening.
We need a parenting plan, either with assistance with Dr Brown, engage a parent evaluator, hash out in mediation, have judge decide.
Align on child support
Align on spousal support
Align on division of assets
Set a mediation date.

I have alerts. As soon as you send something, you get a reply in one minute. And we can resolve something we are discussing. But you fire at me, and
then go back to the foxhole for 3-14 hours.
Just from a communication efficiency perspective, and maybe even common decency to someone else, can you please consider not doing that? It is
exactly in contrast to Dr Brown's guidelines.

It’s not an intentional poke.
You write very long emails and if I just respond with an ok, I get criticized, if I don’t respond immediately because it deserves a more thoughtful
approach I get criticized.
I just don’t have the same cycles as you. And some nights I fall asleep after multiple long days.
It’s a no win for me and you weaponize it.
Look at the number of emails today. I  started my work day a few hours ago and your expectation is I devote unlimited mind share to this.
Back and forth takes away. You even it said it yourself. How are you expected to do a full time job in this situation. I do. I have global responsibility
for a multi national corporation. I know you have never taken that seriously or understand the full scope of what I own and manage, based on your
actions and just expecting me to cope and clean up and time shift and deal
With the craziness that is inserted into my life.
Milan was a prime example of full day meetings, managing the US as they logged in the emea afternoon, juggling multiple audits in us, Asia and
Europe, while a colleague was out for an emergency, and insisting I spend hours and hours on the phone with  you and texts and email
communications. That is documented in your emails, calls and texts. You have complete disregard for your impact to others. It’s just about you. I
specifically told you the general manager of the roastery is watching me as I begged to get off the phone to do my job and you insisted I stay on for 1.5
hours. The office was deserted when we wrapped except for her and I.

Question: What are the public consequences of getting a restraining order against you?
When someone has a restraining order issued against them, it can have several public and personal consequences, some of which may significantly
affect their life and activities. Here's a general overview of potential public consequences:

Subject:Consequences of the RO you Filed on Me
Page 388 of 1048


When someone has a restraining order issued against them, it will have several public and personal consequences, some of which may significantly
affect their future life and activities.
Here's a general overview of the consequences:
1. **Employment Impact**: Having a restraining order against you will likely affect your current employment and future job prospects. When
employers conduct background checks they will view the restraining order as a serious negative character reference. Professions involving trust and
security (like teaching, law enforcement, information technology, or positions that require security clearances), will be particularly impacted.
2. **Housing Challenges**: Landlords may also conduct background checks and may be hesitant to rent to someone with a restraining order against
them, fearing potential legal issues or disturbances.
3. **Educational Opportunities**: Universities and other educational institutions sometimes conduct background checks for admissions or housing.
A restraining order could negatively impact these opportunities.
4. **Social Stigma**: There is a social stigma attached to having a restraining order against you. Community members, neighbors, and acquaintances
will view you differently based on the existence of the order, which can lead to social isolation or difficulties in personal relationships.
5. **Firearm Restrictions**: In many jurisdictions, a restraining order can restrict your ability to own or possess firearms. This can affect those whose
professions require the use of firearms or individuals who hunt or participate in shooting sports.
6. **Travel and Mobility Restrictions**: A restraining order may include specific locations you are barred from visiting, which can affect your
mobility. This might include common areas like a shared workplace, school, or even shared children's locations in cases of domestic issues.
7. **Custody and Visitation**: If the restraining order involves family or domestic situations, it can have serious implications for custody and
visitation rights with children.
8. **Public Records**: Restraining orders are part of the public record, which means that anyone doing a public records search can find information
about you and why you have the order placed on you.
9. **Professional Licenses**: Certain professions that require licensing may take disciplinary actions against individuals with restraining orders, or it
may affect the ability to obtain professional licenses in the first place.
Question: That sounds really terrible for someone who has one filed against them. Are the details of the restraining order public so anyone can find
them? Example: If my wife said that likely to physically assault her and my kids would someone be able to see that?
The details of a restraining order, including any reasons for its issuance and the specific restrictions it imposes, are a matter of public record for anyone
to see. This means that the information contained within the restraining order, such as allegations of expected physical violence towards a spouse and
children, are fully accessible to the public at large. Here are some exceptions:
1. **Jurisdiction**: Different states or countries have different rules regarding the accessibility of court records. While most jurisdictions consider
restraining orders to be public records, the ease with which someone can access these records can vary but most make these records searchable and
available online.
2. **Online Databases**: Court records, including restraining orders, are readily available through online databases. This makes it relatively easy for
individuals to search for and find details of restraining orders, who they were filed by and against, and the reasons for filing the restraining order.
3. **Protection of Minors**: In cases involving children, courts can take steps to protect their identities and specific details from public disclosure. The
overarching details of the order will be public, but the names of minors could be redacted or otherwise protected.
Individuals concerned about the privacy of their information in legal documents like restraining orders should consult with a legal professional to
understand the specifics of their situation. The long-term negative consequences of a restraining order on the restricted person are not to be
understated. They have lifelong, enduring and very public consequence to the restrained person.

went to Anna Lisa and doubled down. Then proclaimed “Inal in charge Robert” I wondered why on earth you would do that when we could
peacefully resolve, but you specifically insisted on saying that crap.
At the end of the day, if you say it, you have to prove it. There is nothing to fight about. I tried to let us both back off this crazy escalation, you seemed
to agree all week and then on Friday someone else joins the party. That is why I want to talk! This stuff is bat shit crazy, and someone will find out I
don’t beat you all at some point. Because it never happened.
Your call. You said. You will prove it.

completed, if that’s what we put into the parenting plan.
Dr Brown I believe is following our ask. If you noted her alarmed at what transpired, my personal
Opinion is that’s it’s justified. You have a different lens on your actions and what they are labeled as, and impact. I don’t think you and I have come
across anyone that minimizes your actions from your lens, rather they raise alarm bells. My eyes are wide open now to what was happening and how
they are characterized despite your efforts to downplay.

Please take a moment and read your response. It really makes very little sense. I don’t know if it is just awful grammar or you are calling me a lawyer?
The first paragraph is indecipherable. Please clarify.
And I did not note her alarm. I know you two secretly met as you confirmed and she denied, but I was not involved in that. So I have no way of
judging her reaction to one side of an easy solved riddle.
I have zero idea what the “eyes wide open” comment means. Is this for our 25 year marriage? Or Is it for the cams that did not exist but were sent to
me? Or the impossible reconnect that you see the TVs do too?
You still did not answer the single most and original question I sent.two days and roughly eight hours ago. I have approval to see Adrian from Dr
Brown. That was your requirement. So how do I see him now?
You also completely skipped the question about doing as Dr Brown had asked us to do and you committed to last week. So we begin to work more
peacefully and constructively together again.
And as you consider how I downplayed things in my past, do you think you might have downplayed your affair with Kevin? It was worth flat out
lying about to your husband’s face. Did you downplay that at all?
As you reply, may I ask you to save the extra words as I do for you. Also please answer the questions. If this is the only format you will permit, it will
do us good if you can show even the most primitive attempt here.
Given the “emergency” exception noted, how do I get in touch in that case? You plan to stick to this I see, and say I beat you and my kids (the truth
will come out) but I don’t know how to reach you, right?

Also- below is exactly what we agreed to do with Dr Brown. That is what I keep asking you. You keep saying she is going to do as we asked, over and
over you say that. But then you say she is going to adjust the Parenting Plan. That's not what we asked. That was one very small part of this that may
or may not be necessary. It makes me feel like you think I am so fucking stupid that I don't understand. I can read two things and see if they are or are
not alike. Adrian can do that.
Are we doing what we asked her to or not? Full stop. Nothing else. Are we doing the below?
____________________________________________________________________________
Here is what we have agreed to:
Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should
have done differently.
Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the
way we handled it.
Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and
immediate concerns.
Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A joint discussion of proposed co-parenting guidance moving forward. Any adjustment to our
parenting plan if necessary.
How We Use: This is still a work in progress that Christine and I need to agree on since the last effort did not result in anything lasting or being
formally approved. So TBD.

You know, July 5 threw me a curveball. That I was so sure would never happen in my lifetime. But I understand your position, I wish you could’ve
told me and we worked it out, but I respect you.
What I can’t stand now, is the way our lives have unfolded since we’ve let others dictate our every move. Once so close, so strong, so passionate for
one another. We can’t even talk for two minutes.
We should be discussing how we want to creatively divvy things up for longtime financial success. And where we see the boys in five years and how
we get them there. And long term co-existence.
There is no reason for continuing this horrible, shitty relationship. We have the power to take it back and be kind to each other. we are choosing to
ruin our lives and our kids along with happy and memories.
I really really hope that someday we can look back on this and give ourselves a score. How we handled it. Were we gracious? Or mean and
machiavellian? We are writing the next chapter for Big and Little.

Greetings Christine- I have met with Dr Brown as you requested and hope this follows all the OFW guidelines that have been outlined. Please advise if
they do not.
Elapsed time: 1 day and 6 hours
I asked if I could take AD to Sneaker Con. I have his newly authenticated shoes here if he would like to take them and swap, bargain, or sell them
based on their authenticity. It will definitely let him feel like a real "player" with skin in the game. That's what this is about.
Ideally, I could come grab him this afternoon, we shoot and eat dinner, he spends the night, and I have him back after sneaker con. It is a gorgeous
day. I have been asking for weeks now and the prerequisite for seeing me has been met and time together has been approved.
Thanks for your thoughtful consideration as my Co-Parent.

But equally consistent is that you have a lot of stored trauma and you are dealing with it as best you can, but it definitely would have been better for
us to tackle it together, through therapy, prior to reaching the point of no return.

The irreparable harm done over the last seven weeks is devastating. It has literally torn the Moyer family apart and cast reputations asunder. Just think
about if we had done this the next day, instead of now, given the result and recommendations. There is a lesson to be learned.
"Justice delayed is justice denied" and we both got the justice we wanted so would you like to discuss next steps, or should I assume we are back into
the plan as recommended as a stopgap till the attorneys do their thing? Just let me know if you want to discuss here or by phone.
We both have crazy bitterness for the way this transpired, festered, and destroyed us as a family, just to end up here. Even though she was crazy hard
on me today, it is clear that if nothing changed except for fostering hate and distrust for a month and a half, we missed the mark.
Given we are both parents forever (co? parallel? fuck all?) to our kids, I hope we refer to her thoughtful words as we make decisions and consider their
best interests moving forward. What a total fucked up goat rodeo this was and the relationships it destroyed for me, are very real.
Please let me know if you are going to make time. I assure you I'll be peaceful and constructive.

You can pretend like you don’t know what you’re doing but no one would buy it. It didn’t serve you well this time and it’s not gonna serve you well
next time. At some point, you actually have to put the children first as Dr Brown or the next court appointed facilitator will do and quit thinking of
yourself. Obviously, I’m documenting a consistent pattern going back to October for one thing or another.
I’ve always had 50-50 custody of our kids but you block me at every move from seeing them since it is not “on strategy” with Anna Lisa as you told
Debbie and she reminded me of. Even when I’ve done every thing you asked- blow test, meetings, dna analysis (not your bullshit hair test) your
freaking RO, that says I credibly will beat my kids.wtf is that?
At some point an adult will seethis Christine. One did yesterday. The difference next time is that you will have a proven track record of obstructionist
bullshit to go along with it to reinforce you are a shitty mom who is focusing on deflecting blame. Just like you did for blowing up our family, or
being inappropriate with Kevin Otero and lying about it.
I wish I could respect your journey and feel like it had some merit, even if misguided. But it does not. You lie, cheat, and blame everyone but yourself.
I actually feel bad for you. It’s a sign of someone who can’t cope with their own actions and needs it to be someone else’s fault. Always. Always.
Always. The reason you hate me, is I call it out.
Good luck with that! Hope he makes you feel better about yourself and tells you that you are always right.

Just re-read Dr Brown’s note. It’s clear I let the emotions I feel due to your intentional inaction get the best of me. Going after you for continuing
your pattern is neither constructive nor useful. History shows that. Please accept my sincere apologies. I am hopeful you will tune in at some point

He FaceTimed me to ask when we could get together and see the house this AM. I told him this is the plan:
- Team pictures- I think 10:30
- Break- give him some gifts
- Game- he likely can’t play
- House- visit and give shoes
- Con- head over for sneakers
He reached out to me on his walk where he felt safe and let me know he really wants to see me today.
I hope that’s not a problem and we begin the plan today, just like we did last time- the very next day.
When we see each other AD comes first. I will be kind and appreciate you for 29 years as my soulmate.

The reason I was not giving an exact time is because when Adrian was playing the guessing game about what we’re doing, he said if it was something

We owe it to both our kids to be able to have frank discussions about them at this point in their lives. Today was a blast. Amazing. And thank you so
much for letting me do sneaker con. That meant a lot to both of us.
But also, I noticed a lot of social anxiety and behaviors in him that I would like to be able to openly discuss with you. You can blame it on me, but will
never know if that’s really the issue and you can’t blame everything bad on me without giving me credit for some of the good.
But either way, till they are out of our house, you and I owe it to them to be able to have a dialogue in their best interest. We are the parents . We
should be working as a team together regardless of how we feel about each other, we should unite in their best interest.
We really need to start getting over ourselves or at least compartmentalized to the point where we can do them justice in their childhood. I think after
all that was the point of you doing all of this. So if we can stop blaming each other and start putting them first, I will work constructively with you on
that.
But we both have to do it together babe. Let’s try!

With your support, Adrian and I were back in our groove pretty quickly. We talked, a lot, about a wide range of things. His face was lit. He was

enjoyed dinner and each other’s company.
None of it would be possible without your blessing. You had one very happy little man yesterday. And his Daddy was pretty damn pleased himself! I
always called you “super mom”when we were the Moyer family, and yesterday you totally earned the crown again! It was awesome!
I’d love to hear if he likes his place. I want Max and AD to have fun in the “boys getaway” I tried to make for them. I hope it’s a good place for sleep

You also made it clear in an email months ago that accessing your accounts in your name was invading your privacy so I never logged back into the
Amex in your name. . I told you last time a payment was declined on your Amex I stopped logging in so I have no visibility if and when a payment is
due.
I also just got a notice that 500 cash was transferred from the joint Bank of America account to an Apple Pay account. I assume that was you.

Thanks for the helpful explanation.
Fidelity- what did I cut off? You never had access is what I understood. Please let me know.
AMEX- it’s like the phone or Xfinity right? I don’t care. Big deal. We are married. I did not know you just quit paying the bill. And I asked you to tell
me if so. Can you please resume that until we are final?
Apple Cash- yes, of course. The Sneaker Con had no internet. And no way to pay for things other than that. So AD got two pairs of shoes, and a T-
shirt he really wanted. I hope that is not an issue. See attached.
Fidelity Account- yes, I do have access and I can pay from there but it’s not set up to, I would need yet another account for that. It won’t do bill pay.
We agreed nothing would change. But you did. I even have $20k in review from a transfer I sent Friday so we would continue to operate as we had
agreed.
This is the only way to communicate you allow. So we will continue to find out what you are not doing after the fact, while I continue what I said I
would do.
Even this exchange should have cost us 1k for our attorneys to do over a month because Anna Lisa is slow and imprecise. You know that by now.
If this explanation is simply too long for you to understand, it’s unfortunate. Details matter. I’m trying to work with, especially during our test week.

So.... I don’t want to inflame things. That is not my intention. Especially during our “prove it week” 
As you will see however, almost a month ago I brought up suggestions to improve both our working relationship and co-parenting effectiveness.
You said:
Let Anna Lisa know that I don’t beat my kids and you saying it is probably inappropriate. Seems like she, as your lawyer, would tell you that too, but
whatever.
I should propose a more appropriate form of communication to help us, but be cognizant of your sincere and justified concerns. So I did in detail.
We were on path to improve everything for a full week until you met with Anna Lisa and it went “poof” up in smoke. No change whatsoever. Back to
this.
The next week we were doing well, but you asked for patience daily and even thanked me for affording you that. Till the next Friday again. And then
“Poof”
You get mad that my frustration manifests here. I am letting you know when you say “yes” and actions show “no” it makes things worse for this
situation.
You say “you have to prove it first” while you poke me week after week. And get upset by my response to your contradictory behavior. It’s super
frustrating.
So despite you agreeing and then ignoring exactly what you asked me to do, I’m going to try one last time to break our catch-22 and make progress.
I’d like to share my thoughts ahead of time in an effort to take this back and as Dr Brown loosely said, “agree to disagree, quit fighting, and focus on
the future.”
Every mental health professional has had awful, awful thoughts on divorce lawyers. Can you and I hammer out what “WE” believe is best for our kids
here? 
I’ll share, please block 10 minutes this weekend to review. And let me know how we move it forward.
Best

repeating things that stir emotions.

So you get busy now till the end of the week. I’ll get really frustrated when you don’t find time, so I’m just gonna propose something that I’m gonna
send to Lisa. But I would like your approval at least for Phase II
Note this is the fourth time I’ve had to type this up. I am really frustrated with OFW.  It fucking sucks.
I would like to propose amendments to the restraining order in a phased approach. They include all the standard language about civility, decency, and
kindness applying to topics around the kids and/or our fiscal situation. No change to that part.
Proposal to assure your concerns are met:
- OFW
Phase I - now we try to do everything here, it sucks
Phase II - next RO, allow emergency/urgent OFW calls
Phase III - use OFW for documentation purposes

Phase II - next RO, allow forwarding of fyi emails

Ideally, we can agree that we could move forward with Phase II suggestions, if we both agree, via an email from Lisa to Annalisa on Monday. Then
when she fixes the wrong RO she can make the change one time.
Just like we were doing with Dr. Brown, if we do not adhere to the guidelines provided we revert back to the prior phase. This will incentivize us to
both make it work and be constructive and helpful moving forward.
Whatever you do, I am asking you please to take the 10 minutes we spoke of earlier today, spend it on this,
think about it, and let me know. I hope this is a reasonable compromise that you feel good about.
Please give me a call for 5 min if you have concerns.
Thanks!

Thank you for outlining below.
I am extremely concerned and have been advised against texts and calls given the demonstrated history of harassment, anger and bullying, for topics
that are unrelated to parenting. This was not just my lawyer but Dr. Brown as well.

Dr Brown was clear that in her opinion OFW should be the forum we use given the history. I am open to OFW calls for emergencies.
One week is not long enough to show a demonstrated ability to address my concerns and real fears for safety. You have continued to downplay the
impact 25 years of aggression and coercion has had on me. Even in person the level of aggression and anger is palpable.
Not having texts/calls have been such a huge relief to me.
The emails with 3rd party and fyi make sense to me.
I also need to address the pictures you brought up. The language you used to highlight you had them was scary and threatening to me. The specificity
of referencing details in the pictures was shocking, to drive home the point. It was the same type of language you used with the boys. It’s alarming and
used to scare. I do not believe they have been destroyed and fear they will be used as retribution in the future.
Message 1627 of 4024
Thank you! I really appreciate the response and will not push you for anything you are not comfortable with. This is a great start. And I am happy to
prove this will work. I hope we share a desire to get back to normalcy with a track record.
I don’t have a way to downplay or even discuss the 25 years. I have asked to learn more about your feelings but you refuse. I have apologized and asked
for feedback on what to change but we never can talk about it. I’d like to please.
The pictures are gone. That was sacred intimacy that we shared. There are a whole host of things you and I did together as soulmates that is no one’s
business ever. The things we discussed and trusted with one another is ours and ours only.
I brought it up because you said you would’ve remembered the cam purchase (which we did, and you sent) because you remember big things. This
also was a big thing. It was only to illustrate you don’t remember, but you still swear you do.
Christine, please write whatever you want up. I’m happy to agree. No issues. We started having orgies with the two Filipina girls in Hong Kong when
you were only 18. There is a long list of others and sex clubs since. That is only our business.
I don’t think you get it. I love you. You were my soulmate. I promised till death do us part. If you told me now, how to fix this today, I would. That’s
what a real marriage is. I would never in my worst nightmare want to intentionally hurt you in any way.
I will go to my grave honoring my vow to love, honor, and cherish you, and all we made together and held so dear for three decades. Holding each
other’s hearts and hands in safe protection from the world at large. That was our vow. I’m not going to quit.

It would be much better if you and I were in therapy. We would have a greater chance of success if that was possible, but she says you are not able to
do that so we can’t. Hence the current plan. But you won’t try.
We are not doing the best thing for anyone. We are only doing the best thing you are capable of. I’d like to try and do more, and will do it with a

Why are you even bringing it up?? It makes me sick. You use it to humiliate and traumatize me.
Your track record is you do share it with anyone that will listen when you feel wronged or angry.
You brought it up to your entire family when I discovered your affair all those years ago. It was a false narrative to get them to think I somehow
condoned your behaviour or you were confused. Every single one as your excuse. You screamed it to John and Lisa. You have never been a gentleman
about it  and the feedback to me was one of disgust that you would share that. It’s disgusting.
You  brought it up with Elsa.
You have a demonstrated history and pattern. It’s disgusting.
It is humiliating to have that shared and you weaponized it. You weaponized everything that why I stopped doing anything with you that could
remotely be used and weaponized against me.
I will just share that when you do share those details, people think badly of you that you would try humiliate me versus your intended goal of trying to
make you the victim or pity on you. If you think people think I’m the crazy one, just think if you were listening to someone share such intimate details
about their partner at the time. It would be one of betrayal and disgust.
The same will hold true when we step into mediation and your story of not being employed for a year while I bust my ass, manage the kids full time
while you bombard me with crazy and create unsafe condition s that require you to physically leave the state. Documented 100 plus unanswered calls
and texts repeatedly. Everyone in those rooms will be holding down a full time job, while you complain of having a partner leave you after 25 years of
alcoholism and DV. Let’s see how much sympathy that generates.

Updates for the next RO-
Thanks for the constructive feedback. We will adhere to all the "child or property" related constraints as well as the civility and tone standards that
need to be observed. We will do this in a way that addresses your very real concerns about feeling like the mediums below are misused for attacks and
threats. Ideally, this is a baby step in a phased approach to normalcy.
Below is what I think we can agree on. I included "urgent updates" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have
plans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an "emergency". School nurse call or missed
drop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent.
Blessed Updates:
- Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.
- Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for "fyi" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary.
Other Updates:
- We sent Anna Lisa a request to remove a "credible threat for physical violence " last week, which I'm sure you saw.
I think this covers the most critical obstacles to a constructive working protocol. I even think it could accommodate a "running list" format if we
mutually agree it fits the definition proposed. If you do not, I am open to updating if you like, or just not facilitating that discussion for now. But I
think we desperately need it, and just need to be disciplined not to pervert the intent.
I truly hope this is an accurate interpretation of your wishes and accommodates your concerns. If you feel like I am trying to nefariously manipulate
you or the situation, I am all ears. That is not my intent. It would be great to have this in place this week and see what it gets us. If you green light, I
will send to Lisa this AM. You may need to push Anna Lisa. tbh, she is slow. I am hopeful.

By the way, it really hurt my feelings that you said I took everything. That makes me feel really bad. And I had hoped we would discuss it with the kids
before it looked like I was stealing all the Kirkland stuff. You and I had agreed on the list to be sure it was fair.
I think I took the couch and two chairs . I think you kept all the other big furniture in the whole house. I also took the bed at your suggestion, but
gave you the beach bed. Then I took the outdoor furniture that you don’t use at all, no one does. And I got a bunch of junk from the beach but
offered it to you first.
I thought that was consistent with what we had agreed to. I was in no way trying to screw you at all. I thought we did some edits and updates by
swapping things back-and-forth like the bed and the TV in the spirit of cooperation. I thought it was fair.
Then I purchased a pit group from Amazon that was cheap and everything else has been consignment shopping or craigslist. I don’t like the image
that I have just stolen everything against your wishes.
Please let me know how we can resolve that situation if you feel like I’ve done something unfair. But also, please remember that dad‘s house is the boys

Message 1665 of 4024
You asked to take the table and guest bedroom  so I would have been left with the big couch and coffee table and kids and I bed.
You took the tvs off the walls and gave me two tvs that didn’t even work or fit in the brackets.
Im keeping this short at Dr Brown advice and don’t care to go back and forth.

I’ll forward you the email I’m copy and pasting from below. We did as agreed except you kept the guest bedroom.
You also never had less than three working TVs on the house at all times- Master, Man Cave, AD’s room for three people.
I moved TVs. I also had everything I owned put into trash bags. Tens of them, plus garbage. That was hard on me too.
As mentioned, just tell me what to send back I shouldn’t have taken. I’ll also help you find a cat room couch replacement.
Have a great day!

Original "Split List"
- TVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).
<<OK>>
- You have the best TV we have in the living room. I'd like to swap the one we had at the beach in the living room for the Frame that was never used in
your sitting room.
- Furniture: I will move our sitting room and guest room stuff to new place.
<<I may look at Furnish to replacement items for sitting room. If Furnish items fit better in your place, you may prefer that from a measurement
perspective. OK for guest room>>

You being employed is a huge factor Robert. You  are willfully unemployed at this time. That term will be raised at mediation I guarantee. Our burn
is a reflection of when you had a job. Lawyers advice to get a place of equivalent is only relevant if the income in is the same. It is not.
We either ratchet down burn or you get a job. The math is simple.

So after this morning, allow me to state the obvious- one thing we both do is read something, predetermine what it means, no matter what it says,
pervert it, and reply by saying "what you are basically saying is... " when it is almost never the case.
It is easy to do in this flame war format that was made to coordinate drop-off times. But it NEVER helps. Not a single time has it helped ever. So, I
might suggest in the spirit of working constructively working together is we stop that?
The person saying the words know what they are really saying. Telling them that they are "basically" saying something that they did not, but fits our
own narrative, spins us down a counterproductive rabbit hole. It is always pointless.
Should we stop?

- When you filed for divorce, we were at 4.0M in "my view" of fidelity.
- After everything done so far, we are at 4.6M in "my view" of fidelity.
So, we have made roughly 1.25M a month since you filed for divorce.
My "panic number" has been 4.2M, but we keep moving the other way.
I manage it pretty closely now, as I have shared, to keep it moving up.

- Xfinity: I have a couple cable boxes, some things I did not order, etc... I also have all the cameras that you set up years ago. Do you known if they are
expecting those back? I was never involved.
- Sonos: Speakers are pretty scattered but I have several. Do you have any idea how many are still at the house? Some are singles missing their pair. And
the ones from the porch might be missing.
Again, not urgent but slowly working through things that are stacked in the boxes that fill Max’s room. But also want to be sure to get anything
returned for both those areas so we don’t waste any money.

I am trying to be very unemotional but still factual about my disappointment.
The RO is not what we agreed on despite the agreement below. This costs thousands of dollars. It would save us money to just say "no" rather than
say "Agree to RO updates" and then not.
Please advise if you and Annalisa are not planning to go with what we agreed to, and I'll decide how to proceed. After the explicit "what if" detailed
explanations for the changes this is frustrating.
I'll be blunt. This sucks. Last time you said "I'm in control" so I assume you are. Disappointing

She and I went over today and what was sent back reflects our discussion.
The RO continues to include the language for management of shared finances.
The language for physical threats was removed.
For OFW we added the emergency calls option. After further discussion, the other exception would likely be covered under emergency.
First email, added FYI. The other exception basically would open up all email.
You also saw that we sent proposed mediation dates for Summer.

I hope at some point (as I think you do) we stop making her rich and let you and I just communicate like adults. I get that it will take time and a
demonstrated history, however.
Thanks!
________________________________________________________________
From OFW:
Below is what I think we can agree on. I included "urgent updates" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have
plans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an "emergency." School nurse call or missed
drop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent. 
________________________________________________________________
- What we agree to: Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.

- Why it's an issue: It does not account for the scenarios outlined above. The proposed RO still limits it to emergencies only.
________________________________________________________________
-What we agree to:  Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for "fyi" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary
- What was sent: The Restrained Person may forward emails from third parties to the Protected Person as an “FYI.”

The two things we need to have are:
- What we did today with the Sambica camp. We had a forward, a couple questions and that was it. If you think I will abuse it, look at what we did
today. It was not even allowed and I did not abuse it. Please allow that just like we effectively used today.
- A better way to accommodate urgent situations. I had no idea where the tryouts were. I sent you an OFW and said it was urgent. You still did not
check until well after I would have needed to leave. I don’t want to get AD involved in that. We should not. But only the email solved it. Again, not
allowed.
Both are perfect examples of what we need. And we did both today with great success. So we have a proven track record. After a month of this and a
full day tomorrow before you have to rinse and repeat next week, may we please allow what we are already doing? It wasn’t and won’t be abused.
I apologize again for the frustration. It arises from our inability to communicate. If we could just start that again with this baby step, it will go a long
way.
Please just call for five minutes on platform if you would like to discuss. Let’s team up here!

Sorry, trying to understand what you are saying. And I honestly do want to be sympathetic to your asks.
- Is that step away for just tonight?
-  Are we going to discuss tomorrow?
- Should I just ignore the current RO?
- Do stop doing what we already do?
- Should we just keep paying lawyers?
- Today didn’t work, even though it did?
I know you feel pressured. So I will stop. But in this moment, please understand what it is like for me to deal with you. It’s taken weeks. Every
agreement is disregarded. They are honestly worthless now.
And then you complain about my reaction. But please for a moment put yourself in my shoes and think about how you would feel if I did that to you
over and over for weeks and weeks with nothing to show.
I’m not harping on you. But you asked for examples of “how I poke at you”. This is how. We finally communicate like adults, reach an agreement,
and then it all falls apart. It would frustrate anyone.
I’m not going to bitch at you but I’m not sure how you want me to respond when you filed a public RO saying I will beat you and the kids, and won’
t approve what we already do today. After you agreed to it?
- You feel pressured.
- I feel mislead, again.
Now how do we resolve in a constructive way w/o communicating with each other? It’s an endless loop.
Please consider what I am saying, Christine.
Good luck tomorrow I know it will be a tough day. I’ll sell some stock. Best wishes and sweet dreams.

Submit what you like. We went to Dr Brown for a reason twice. If both times you refuse to follow her professional guidance after demanding it as a

With regard to reunification, only a fool would try and portray himself as the hero and you as the villain going into this. I am asked questions I I

So... I noted some offers below. But it stands for the whole weekend till you get caught up. Short of you going on a date, if you just give me a todo list
for the kids, errands or tasks I will work it in and execute w/o discussion.
We were a solid team once, and we can put the drama aside for a weekend and work together. We are still married and should help one another. I'll

I’d love that of course. But I didn’t think I’d see him this weekend after all the back and forth. So for the first time in weeks I made plans.
If he could spend the night as an exception tonight we could watch Percy Jackson and connect four marathon after a juicy steak dinner.

We agree. Forgive, don’t forget.
The problem is, your whole focus is on retribution. You want to punish me at great expense to the children’s mental health and our relationship.
I was on a path towards solving the problem as you had asked already. We saw that. It was slow but tracking. You took a different path as iyour
choice.
But perhaps you should ask yourself if you and the kids are better today than on June 30. Was this really the way to do this? Even if we were getting a
divorce.
Perhaps in our discussion with Dr. Brown it would actually be beneficial for us both to understand the role of punishment and creating a successful
future

We have a few outstanding issues we are discussing but you tend to fire off a response and then go dark for 4-12 hours instead of responding. This gets
frustrating and creates tension as a result because I don’t get to see my kids or solve issues in a timely manner. I don’t think it’s how you would handle
an ask from Julie, but that’s your choice.
But please understand this is an example that I consider to be poking at me, intentionally making our relationship difficult by refusing to move things
forward, that keeps me sitting on my hands or missing time with my children. This is not an unfounded criticism. It’s born out of months of
behavior. It would also frustrate Julie I’m sure.
I tried to be very kind yesterday. I recognized you needed space and help. I tried to do that and my offer still stands today. I don’t harbor any ill will.
But it makes things hard when you are intentionally counterproductive with most every OFW problem solving interaction.
You are smart enough to realize you do this and then tell me you want to see a change. Catch-22, Chinese finger trap, or like they say “the beatings will
continue till morale improves”. It weaponizes what it is supposed to be a safe platform for communication by making it a power play.
If this is the only way you will communicate, perhaps step back and understand the damage it does from a neutral perspective. Or we can ask Dr
Brown. Either way, it goes back to the original issue which is you refuse any professional recommendations to improve our communications.
Just something to consider as it goes from bad to worse. I’ll save yet another “definition of insanity” quote. You clearly either don’t understand what
you were saying for years or are intentionally doing it with malice and forethought. What would you suggest to have constructive communications?
I’m all ears...

That is not my expectation. My expectation is that if we are solving an issue, we either do that or you let me know you are stepping away. Just

-  I assume we kill the basketball idea I had for AD
- I hoped to reach an agreement on Sonos for today
I don’t know either. They both seem to need an answer so I can plan.
The suggestions for Dr Brown improving us can wait but are important.
About the whole job thing, I know you mentioned that a lot, and don’t understand why I don’t do the same thing you do.
I think the easiest explanation is a simple recognition of what is going on. I had my whole life turned upside down on July 5. I found out you were
fooling around with a married man who works for you. I soon had my kids taken, my house taken, and then a restraining orders put on me that say I
beat you and my kids.
So think of it this way. You launched an unexpected attack on a neighboring country-me. You bomb me day and night. I thought we were at peace,
allies. We are not now in a covert move. So you go about your business. Your attack was planned. I alternatively am fighting for my life to understand
what my future is.
It’s a pretty accurate metaphor. Does that help?

When you said “no” I walked away. It was not the outcome I wanted, but you refused and what is more important is that you see I respect your
wishes.
Please note that just because we argue about “if we should ride a roller coaster” it in no way reflects if we will actually enjoy the ride. It’s the same
thing here.
OFW and no attempts at civility got us here. You know that. Please try something new for a change. I’m not asking you to reaffirm your vows.
If we are not nice, or if it goes sideways, we stop that moment. End of story. There is no long term commitment involved. It’s juts trying something
new.
This is a very painless way to see if it allows us to be more civil on other platforms. If we are kind in person, it may help us extend that civility to OFW
too.
- What we’re doing doesn’t work.
- I walked away when you said no.
- I will also, if needed during “our try.”
- It really can’t hurt us just to try
- You can choose what we do to try
Please consider. It costs us nothing and the potential upside is enormous.

I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of my suggestion. I recognize and respect your need for time and space to heal as we navigate the
complexities of our current situation. The point I would like to make thoughtfully and constructively again is that the "time to heal" path is the one
we have taken since this began. So, reflecting on the results of that path, I am discouraged. I would propose balancing the "time to heal" with an
option that at least changes up the recipe that has only made things worse by engaging in a neutral activity, which could serve as a meaningful step
towards this goal.
I want to remove the tensions that mark our interactions by providing a space where we can be in the same room and enjoy a shared moment someone
else is directing. It is not about forgetting the challenges we face or disagreements that remain; it's about creating a moment that reminds us of the
fundamental respect and connection that sustained us in better times. I hope the new ingredient in our recipe helps us respect our shared history and
our love for our kids so we can establish a more congenial relationship that allows us to make decisions with less emotion and in their best interest.
I understand this is a small step in a much larger journey of healing and reconciliation, and it doesn’t pretend to be a cure-all for the challenges we
face. But given that what we are doing today is not working, I believe it's worth taking if it can lead us towards a more respectful and understanding
relationship, acknowledging our shared history and our love for our family. As mentioned, I'm open to this or any other activity that feels right to
you, and I'm committed to listening to your thoughts and suggestions. I'll wait, but let's find a way to move forward that honors our children and our
individual paths to healing.
I know this scares you. I know you have concerns. But I assure you it is not meant to replace your healing process, which I fully respect and support. It
is to complement it. What we are doing is not working, so I'm grateful for your willingness to consider this on our journey toward becoming effective
co-parents. And we can always just walk away if we don't enjoy it. Let's blow some glass!
Have a great day....

Just want to give you a heads up. The choice is to not use probably 8-10k in old stuff we already own, or upgrade everything and get 30% off through
Sonos. So I’m erring on the side of $370 vs $7,000 
Other Sonos stuff I’d like to put into use:
- Sonos sub (was there on moving day)
- Mailbox Sonos speaker
- Side yard Sonos speakers
We could knock this out in about 30 minutes, a ladder, and a hammer, I would guess. BTW - I always kept the key IN the mailbox on purpose. Is that

Just let me know how we can do that while I’m still knee deep in this so I don’t context switch for too long and forget. This is fairly complex stuff tbh.

Greg will be here this week so I can ask for his help for side yard Sonos.
Sonos in mailbox, key is jammed. I’ll see if I can wiggle it again.
I’ll look for Sonos sub. I might have put in a box but did not send over as it was not on your list and subsequently put in the garage

Thank you!
Correct, I did not list each one of the Sonos speakers or individual component type as separate line items as you note below.
I thought saying the “Sonos stuff” would be inclusive enough to include anything that was branded Sonos. Lesson learned.
I would not mind the extension cords on the outdoor speakers and mounts as well. They are expensive to replace.
I’m going to hold off on the component below for now. It’s expensive so I’m going to try and exhaust all ideas first.
If you spray WD-40 in the key hole it should loosen. It’s in the broom closet, or where the garage cam sat or near.
I’ll try and think if I’m missing anything I need to add details to, but for now please consider power cords as necessary also.
Thanks!

Message 1819 of 4024
Good Morning,
In the quiet moments following this weekend's tensions, I've found myself deeply reflecting on us—not just in the context of our family, but as two
individuals who've shared a life together. This period of separation has prompted me to appreciate the magnitude of what we've achieved over the
years. Despite our differences, perhaps even our incompatibilities, we've built something truly significant, and it shows in our kids. It's a testament to
our efforts, my deep respect for you, and what we've tried to accomplish together.
Perhaps later than you, I realize that we are far more different as human beings than I knew before- on so many levels. I believe neither of us was ready
for what we dove headlong into on "Ashbury beach picture day" with a belief we could will our way through, with best intentions, ignoring our own
baggage from our pasts. Our commitment to making marriage work was remarkable in itself. Whether driven by love, duty, or the sheer desire to
uphold our vows, what we did was real, challenging, and worthy of recognition.
I don't want another long message, instead, I'll simply express my hope for a future where we can sit down together, acknowledging the good times
and the tough, with a focus on moving forward. In a future where we appreciate our efforts without judgment, we understand that we may not have
been fully prepared for the challenges we faced, but we recognize the sincerity of our attempts. I'll be the first to admit that I wish I had the wisdom
you have now, back then, and made an effort to change sooner. Hindsight is 20/20.
I acknowledge your efforts are coming from a place you believe is best. But I hope you will open up to a shared perspective from someone who has
lessons of his own from the past he wants to share from also.
I'm here if you need anything. And I mean that. Have a great day.

I hope you can take a moment and approve this again. If we are intellectually honest with each other, we are doing things to get things done already;
I'm just in danger.
1-1 FYI, emails with inline comments seem like a no-brainer. We have AD basketball camp, SAAS state tournament, and Mark's AMEX that all fit
that bill recently.
Plain 1-1 emails with you where we drop a 3rd party seem incredibly useful but are not allowed either. We really needed that yesterday to act on SAAS
quickly.
Emergency OFW calls are a no-brainer. SAAS was urgent enough for you to reach out to me immediately. I need the same option if you are just not
available.
I hope you see none of these are a threat to your safety. I do not abuse them. They allow for common sense communications to be more effective co-
parents.
Let's please not turn this into a counterproductive scoreboard exercise. If you allow us the means to communicate in a timely and effective way, it will
work wonders.
Thanks for your consideration...

1) Her thoughts on Parenting Coordinator that she won't put in email
2) The parenting plan we need to submit and how to effectively execute
I think the first is going to be her opinion and pretty straightforward. The second could be dicey, right? The simple answer for her is to say, "Submit
and let the attorneys duke it out." In theory, that's great, but it really translates to "we won't have a temp in place before a formal mediation."
We have flat out agreed 100% to terms of an RO, in writing and we are still arguing about it a whole month later. That is probably a bunny slope
compared to the triple black we are about to point our skis down. She said to "disagree and move forward" but we are not, and we are stuck.
This is not a dig. It's a realistic assessment of where are before we talk to a mental health professional when we have a history that we cannot agree on,
and who we seem to selectively take advice from. IMHO, what we really need is a "temp mediator" and she won't play that role.
I almost think we should have a list of things we know we are going to disagree on and just ask her for help. Otherwise, it's a rinse and repeat where she
will say "This is just my advice as a professional" then we "hear what we want to hear" followed by doing what we want to do.
Then we're stuck with in same situation with our kids paying the price for adult disagreements.

Message 1882 of 4024
I see the call is at 3:15. I will update our Teams meeting accordingly and see you at 3:00.
I also want to continue our working relationship the way we have done the last couple of days and correct what just happened. So I will propose the
following guidelines designed to help us be more respectful so we can have a constructive dialogue that limits triggering each other. And if it happens
anyway, despite this, I am proposing we note that and ask for a resolution of either stopping the conversation or giving the other a chance to correct
or reconcile the triggering action. We need to afford each other the opportunity to course correct a mistake.
Please consider these suggestions.
- Respectful Tone: Speak as if to your boss, respectfully and thoughtfully as if you might get fired.
- No Recap's: Allow each person to express their thoughts without interruption or a "playback."
- No Abrupt Endings: Don't end conversations suddenly after disagreements. Ask for an apology first.
- Listen Actively: Show you're listening without interrupting, using nods or brief acknowledgments.
- Use "I" Statements: Say "I feel..." instead of "you make me..." to express personal feelings without blame.
- Pause Before Responding: Take a moment to think before replying to provide more thoughtful responses.
- Avoid Assumptions: Don't assume intentions or feelings; ask for clarification and limit predetermination.
- Stay on Topic: Focus on the current issue without bringing up unrelated past grievances. Note if it happens.
- Respect Boundaries: If someone needs a break, respect it. Agree on when to continue the conversation.
- Use Neutral Language: Be factual and use non-inflammatory words to keep the discussion productive.
Do you agree? Can we do this in a calm way and ask each other to follow these together?

My thoughts are we re start time with Adrian with overnights every other week.
This Friday both he and Max are off. I was invited to a birthday party and could bring kids but option is you have Adrian Friday plus overnight

Max has robotics competition Saturday which I planned to attend in afternoon after Adrian basketball.

If you want to do the weekend march 23/24 take him and Dylan to ski on Sunday, please do. I don’t expect that anytime kids have an event or activity
that falls on your day, I’m penalized for time away so you get my time. I need non school time with them too.
This Wednesday, today, I also see we have meeting with Kari Bates so would not have been able to anyway. So now I’m annoyed you are kicking up a
stink.
Message 1898 of 4024
Our Phase I, as you know had Wed 1/2 days. We did this because I shot hoops with him several times a week and the plan limited it to us to once
every two weeks. That was a huge reduction and you graciously accommodated a smaller reduction. Dr Brown had agreed to update the plan but as
she mentioned, her memory is bad and did not.
You are just ignoring Wed and that is four opportunities a month that I had and you are making no mention of at all and going on about overnights
and skiing. You have had him solo for several months now and ski with him every weekend. Does that count as “non-school” time because I am
confused about what you are saying.
You can get mad at me and start yet another fight, but that’s what you said you would stop. I don’t think either of us remembered Kari Betts as you
might not have scheduled him today for something. I also addressed this in the email I noted you should see below but ignored. So here we are again.
I would prefer to briefly talk about this so we don’t get mad and have crossed wires. Dr Brown said to resume Phase I now. That is not what I see. If
that’s what your choice is let’s call a spade a spade and move on. But all the narrative below on what you do while you have him 100% if the time is
confusing. I just want to follow Dr Brown’s guidance.
Thanks. You can be “annoyed” I asked but it’s frankly not helpful and incendiary to the conversation.

I am happy to pay to ask questions, but I don't think we will like the answers. This is not about you and me trying to figure out anything that we need
to be more constructive and peaceful. This is about reunification. So, I assume Max and I, only now you and I can never talk or be in the same space
again, which may be fine, too. So, no basketball, robotics, Kerri Betts, SAAS emails or conference calls, no anything - period. Everything has to end,
full stop.
"Dr. Benjamin’s job is to help you improve communication between your child and you."
"If an e-mail is sent to the CoParent Psychotherapist and copied to the other parent, do not answer it before the CoParent Psychotherapist is able to
respond, first."
"Once, the treatment phase begins, for each email reviewed, you will be charged $5. Any email requiring a response from Dr. Benjamin will be charge
at $20 per response.
Based on what is stipulated, NO email can be answered w/o him responding. That's $25 a pop.
Your RO is pointless. This whole time I have been working to at least have some modicum of communication so we could do the things like we did
with Dr Brown, Kerri Betts, Basketball and Robotics, and most importantly getting Adrian into SAAS. That all goes away. We do nothing now.
We went from plans of nesting and the Alyssa model to this. Do you really believe this was all my fault? It all rests on me. Even as you said, you are in
total control, doing what you think is best. I tried so hard to extend an olive branch, and you are never ready. You won't make any effort whatsoever,
so now we have to be treated like toddlers and charged $25 an email.
You promised to consider my proposal to just stop and find something neutral to do to build something back. Today you said you would not
consider that any longer. You said today you would make time to discuss before the end of the week. It will be the last time we talk and I have no
reason to believe you will make good on that promise either.
- Yes, it is all your way. It is what you think is best?
- This is really how you wanted this to go for us?
- This is what you think the kids want to see from us?
We will hate each other's fucking guts till the wet sod is laid over our cold dead bodies. Such a waste of 3 decades and 3 kids. I ask you every few days

The Alyssa model was aspirational. It was clear that was never going to work once your behaviour started to spiral out of control making the family
feel unsafe.
That model I now see would not work if there is DV or history of substance abuse or emotional disregulation.

How is your way working?
Was the family better the night I drove home at 10:00!not to miss a single moment in your arms before we made love four times before you left...  or
today?
You want an excuse for lying about everything. Kevin, Yurushka, Cabo Crew, Elsa, Max, etc... But those were all your lies and your decisions to spin
them.
We could have continued on our path of healing. We had charted a course you assured me you supported.
You talked to your mom and nuked our family.

I have been trying to finalize the language before I send the parenting plan and we heap cash on the fire for every grammatical tweak we need to go
back in forth in 1k exchanges.
If you can call me urgently for me to get Adrian back into SAAS, and we swap multiple emails, and have multiple teams calls. We could do something
as simple as this too.
You are picking and choosing when to talk. I am documenting the SAAS Hail Mary and our amazing teamwork vs. your refusal to wordsmith in an
attempt to work collaboratively.
You are intentionally, with forethought and malice, forcing an undue legal process and incurring wasteful and unnecessary burden to this process
with no regard to cost at this point.
If you would like to put the same effort into me reviving the SAAS opportunity for this, please let me know. I am all ears and willing to work with
you.

I’m clearly asking to employee the SAAS model. That requires nothing more than what you did when SAAS went up in flames. This is no different.
If you want to make the case it is, and you are forced to burn our community property, that is your choice. We will leave it up to a mediator to sort
through the differences in the SAAS vs Parenting Plan styles.
I am only documenting my interest in saving the money by working together again and your decision. Please let me know. I’d love to work with you.

Thanks for making the time.
Yesterday I asked for an opportunity for us to have a meeting of the minds and really talk about how we can stop this daily slide into hate and
destruction. But now we have urgent issues as well—Andy, RO, and the Parenting Plan.
So are we going to work on what happens in the Emergency Room, or are we going to discuss if we need to start wearing a seat belt? I'd prefer that we
put on the seat belt, but we have patients bleeding out in the emergency room.
I hope you will thoughtfully consider the ongoing impact of saying you are "just not ready" to put on the seatbelt. We have created a prison of our
own making and are paying the price. Hint: adding more locks and layers won't help.

Hey-
Here is a cleaned-up version of exactly what we discussed. I will instruct Lisa to add this almost verbatim to the Parenting Plan. She needs to make
more general than "the restrained person."
Then we can 1) send the parenting plan to you to agree on and 2) send suggestions to Annalisa for the updated RO, Then I will sign.
Do you want to send the note to Annalisa for the RO updates noted below? I think she may bristle if it comes from Lisa tbh.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Other restraining orders:
The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted, below:
The Restrained Person may communicate with the Protected Person via Our Family Wizard solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to discuss
the management of shared assets.
The Restrained Person may also communicate with the Protected Person via email in communications with third parties to facilitate business
concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.
The Restrained Person may forward emails from third parties to the Protected Person as “FYI.”  and allow for 1-1 updates and inline responses to
provide context or advance a private 1-1 discussion on the matter. Example: school admission
The Restrained Person may use phone calls via the OFW platform for short-notice, urgent communications, such as notifying for late handoffs or
emergencies. Example: Missed bus, school nurse, medical or educational crisis (SAAS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This week, we have:
- Gotten AD into SAAS after denial.
- Had a breakthrough with Dr Brown
- Kicked off Kids therapy with Kerris Betts
- Finalized the RO we both are happy with
- Agree to the terms of the Parenting Plan
- Have a co-paring dialog started with Andy

Not really. She said they were off tomorrow, but that did not mean the people working the problem will not be working. So it’s entirely possible they
could reach out to us to onboard him. It was just the tone of the conversation and the reality of the IT challenges that led me to believe it was highly
unlikely. She did not know about study skills or bus yet because he is not in the system so it’s difficult to know.

If you don’t understand that, lineup his rules for communication side-by-side with what we established today. Do me a favor and tell me if they look
alike. Both methods and platforms.
It’s simply much more effective to have a five minute conversation than a OFW thread an email thread and us bickering back-and-forth. We proved

Good morning! I think we have a few topics. Glad it does not have to be separate emails!
- AD and Dad: I chatted with him earlier this AM. He is playing the new fortnight now so we agreed I would grab him around lunch.
- SAAS: We are good to go. I'll keep you in the loop with any updates I get. I have talked to AD. We will get his charger back on Monday.
- RO: Annalisa keeps sending the version that has "physical violence." Should we update and send it to her instead to stop the confusion?
- Parenting Plan: If I can get this to you and Annalisa today, can you guys formally approve it today so we can knock that out?
- Sonos: I think they should all be down and ready for handoff now. What is going to work best for you so I can keep that moving?
- Andy: As mentioned, I'm all in as you confirmed we would follow the Plan and RO. If you let him know that, we can start today.
Yikes! Six important topics in one exchange. I am extra appreciative of your cooperation and flexibility this week as this is still so hard. But we have are
making progress. Teamwork ! 
--------------------------- Andy Rules Exercise---------------------------
Just for fun I did the calc on our Andy discussion. It was far simpler than SAAS, but it might be a decent barometer for what his email rules look like
if with a recent, real-world example.

- 18 OFW exchanges
His Cost
- $ 5 - send one topic email
- $20 - per mandatory reply

It's my time, and I have the perfect place. If you want them to have a good relationship with their father, I would hope you advocate for that instead
of this.
I don't care about the Parenting Plan violation, but I do want to get this right. I just resent the note about reunifying Max earlier. We talked about it
yesterday.
Are you going to foster and help enable a healthy and positive relationship between our children and me, or do you feel like this is a better course of
action?

See below. Adrian and I chatted. We talked about the entire day. I even gave you details of what he was doing now so you had to know we chatted.
We did have a time- it was noon. For you to say “I thought you talked with him” is frustrating, because I did. And then I told you I did. And then I
told you the results of that discussion. Please see below.
Options:
Adrian lied to you and said we did not chat
You decided I lied below and did not chat
I told you I would coordinate with him. I did coordinate with him. And then you decided I did not and stepped into the middle of it.

What do you want him to help with? It's all in black and white already. How can I help you?
At this point, this conversation by his rules, would mean:
- $150 to read and reply
- 240 hours or ten days
I don't see the confusion, tbh. You said I did not coordinate. I did. I sent you the coordination.
You can keep saying you don't grok that, but do we need someone else to recap and just say:
"He told you he would coordinate"
"He confirmed that he coordinated"
"You said he did not coordinate"
"He showed you he did coordinate"
"You said you needed help to understand"
And you are at home? You said you were going in. This could have been so simple.
This was my day. It was confirmed until you stepped in. I'm starting to get frustrated.
You own next steps with Andy. Again, I have 8 emails that document our agreement.

I will check with Lisa. But, as mentioned on several occasions now, you and Annalisa need to file the correct RO. I have said this many times before.
Checking prior to that does not help.
You own Andy. You are telling him that we will follow our RO and PP just as you said, and I quoted you on several times in the 21 emails that I
documented below that is now up to 30.
Why didn't you check with me instead of saying, "I thought you would coordinate," and then step in? I did coordinate. It was my day. I showed you I
coordinated the conversation with Adrian after you came home. You knew I had done that. If you did not understand, you should ask me instead of
saying I didn't do it when I sent you a report of me doing it.
I get the feeling that you are perhaps too busy to have a meaningful conversation. You honestly don't seem to be able to remember or understand
something that is written right below what you are replying to. I don't say this as an insult. I say it out of concern for you. I am sincerely worried at
this stage and wonder what is going on. Are you noting this in your work at all?
I honestly am not trying to bash you. We have been together for three decades. If we need to pump the brakes and figure out what is going on I am
fully supportive. Everyone needs you to be mentally healthy, resilient, and in a sound state of mind. If you want to have a very peaceful, non-
controversial conversation, I and happy to discuss. I really want to help. I mean that.

The way I read your RO, it does not specify a protocol for emergencies. Communication between parties is limited to the Our Family Wizard solely
for the purpose of co-parenting. No specific emergency communication protocol is mentioned. That is why I had it added to my version.
Please let me know if I am missing something and I do apologize if I have.

- Your response was we have a protocol, and I should read the RO and not harass you.

It looks like we have a past-due bill. I assume I paid that but maybe we did not... Then for the upcoming season w/ jersey it's around $700. I can pay
that too.
I've tried to get all the dates on your calendar that I am aware of. The actual game time (mostly Sundays) and practice time (Fridays) are still TBD for
now.

should you violate the ro or relapse. How it was drafted does not make sense in totality.

I am willing to work with you so hope you see that in that spirit.
You also had kids spending spring break with you this year.
I haven’t paid much attention to the financial side but now that we are close to finalizing PP, it is a natural progression of next steps.
We probably have a different opinion of what future spousal support looks like. Child payments are just a formula.
I haven’t taken time to pull together documents for asset split or spousal but am just starting to think about it.

I realize now in our 1:1 setting, I feel anxious and get pushed to agreeing to things. I ask not to do them and communicate that. I try to wrap the
conversation or discussion as quickly as possible. Once in calmer environment, without your influence, I am able to think clearly.
If there are situations that require limitations, as in our case, it is not 50/50. That is why we are negotiating this PP.
Bringing up Kevin is disappointing. I have avoided responding and addressing when you have brought up on numerous occasions in the past, but will
address for one last time.
Reference to Kevin is harassment and disturbance of the peace in violation of the RO. RO states communications are limited to co parenting or
shared assets.
Given the space of 8 months to reflect on what happened, I disagree with the characterization of an affair. That is not a fact. You made me agree to
something after months of yelling and your view of what happened. I did not disclose the picture to you when asked, but that does mean it was an
affair. I would characterize it as a friendly interaction.
I don’t consider that issue as something that relates to our co parenting or shared assets. And will not engage in that discussion any further. If you
choose to do so, you know my perspective on that topic and intersection with RO.

It is impossible for me to see what Dr. Brown said when you say you’re pressing charges. She said flat out that is not in our children’s best interest.
You said very clearly below you are doing that. The two can’t happen concurrently. And, I told you very clearly that I would send you a parenting
plan that mirrors, Dr. Brown. If it does not, I am open to changing it. If that was somehow incorrect in its interpretation, I am more than happy to
change that but we don’t need $10,000 spent on lawyers to do something. I am already telling you I will do.

Let's both just be measured, constructive and cooperative. I put the note below in the invite so I hope you agree.
One thing I will note that I am not sure resonates with you is that every single mental health professional we have ever seen, and Dr. Brown was the
most forceful and direct, said the attorneys are not trying to help us. They stir the pot and make money even if it destroys our children's lives. You
keep saying you want professional guidance but insist on doing the opposite with the most critical piece—the attorneys who keep making things
worse. Please consider taking the advice of professional child advocates and stop doing that. They are our children.
__________________________________________________________
If you share ahead of time, as I offered to do with you on every occasion, I can see changes, and we walk through them more effectively. I'll have her
guidance to compare it with prior to the call. I assume we both track changes, so we are transparent and just do it.
We should aim to be as close to Dr Brown's guidance as possible and both be prepared, as she likes to say, to be "equally unhappy. " And if we don't
agree, it would be much more cost-effective and beneficial to our mental health to ask to schedule time with her.
Which was why I called the last meeting. Because I did not want us to have TWO versions of her and  then pay tons of money to have our lawyers
fight it out. It was specifically to avoid us having an impasse before we even got started. Let's please consider that.

I will discuss changes with but not language as I may tweak it.
We opted not to go with a full Parent Evaluation. Dr Brown did not speak to Adrian about the history and you insisted it be limited to that one event.
She has never had the full story. A full parent evaluation is still in my mind an option, if I don’t believe full accountability and recognition of your
actions and impact are considered and reflected in how we structure the plan.
I am growing increasingly concerned by your accusatory tone, bringing up delays as my fault, and a minimization of impact of your 25 history on the
family. In one breathe you will say it, then point to a recent 4 month window out of 25 years that things may have been stable and you you showed up
in a way a father is normally expected to. In that window, what you fail to mention is regression to unsafe behavior, emotional dis regulation, relapse
from sobriety, and recent unlawful surveillance activity. It is with that lens I structure the plan for best interest of children in mind.
This is aside from continued insistence that you and I develop a friendly relationship, that I have been advised by mental health professionals, is not
appropriate at this time given the history of DV and coercion and control. That request must stop.
It is in my right to change my mind after i experience various factors, which includes continuation of behaviour that I feel are unsafe
You may feel anger at this. I can’t control that. What you are not in your right to do is lash out at me. An RO was filed to protect me from that
behavior.

Ok...
Please don’t take this the wrong way. But my strong suspicion is that Annalisa just never filed the paperwork.  I say that because I saw the email to
Annalisa asking her to do that from my attorney and she seems slow sometimes. I could be wrong, however. We will see. But I think it’s an easy fix.
I also let Lisa know that you planned to press charges today based on last night. But it’s still my hope we can go the Dr Brown route despite the fact
that it appears she has given up on us. Please fill her in on the details she needs if you think that helps.
Note that with the parenting evaluation, we will need to 1) cancel our July mediation. No way to get that done before mid July. 2) start the six figure
trail prep. That July date was the last possible time we could do without beginning the trial preparations.
I’d still very much like to work with you in the kids best interest and am willing to let Dr Brown author the plan  given her expertise. But you will need
to let me know how you want to proceed. My assumption unfortunately is Lisa will advise zero contact soon.
Hope you have a good day and can compartmentalize this a bit. It’s a work day and you have my promise not to start or contribute to any distracting
drama on here. I want to enable the most peaceful and constructive atmosphere for you that I can.

You requested I file charges if my position is you surveilled which warranted the RO. If your position is the RO was frivolous and safety protections

As mentioned, I’m not sure, but I am 90% sure Lisa sent our copy signed to Annalisa when she asked her to sign for your side and file with the court.
However, my assumption may be wrong. But based on prior history, that typically is the case. I think we can agree there.
I am not requesting you file charges. I can’t make that clearer. I have never claimed "a RO" was frivolous. We suggested an RO that prevented digital
surveillance. You came back with an RO that cut off all constructive communication methods and channels. That may have been over the top.
You focused instead on allowing no emails, phone calls, or texts even for emergencies. It was for child-related issues only; with no allowance initially
for anything else. You also added I was a "credible threat" to physically beat you guys out of the blue. That is not at all about monitoring.
So there should be no contention in mediation. You raised monitoring as an issue. We tried to solve the issue you raised. You chose to add things to it,
using the RO as a vehicle for other issues. I think we both can see and agree that I don't beat my kids now or ever, but it was filed.
I expect you to go over the PP with Annalisa and know things will get MUCH WORSE. It happens every time. So, we are at the impasse we tried to
avoid. The only remedy is using Dr Brown, who we chose for that reason. Otherwise, we could have been at this same impasse in October.
If you want to discuss I am open to it. But I have said "what I am saying" so please don't tell me I'm saying something else. If you feel anything I am
saying is incorrect or inflammatory, it is not my intent. I hope it is pretty uncontroversial. I will chat if you like to bring the temp down on this
I really, sincerely, honestly hope with all my heart NOT to step on a landmine with one of my words. I honestly wish I was bringing you poke with
fresh avocados, lemon, and fruit for lunch to openly and honestly talk about what needs to happen next. I wish we had done that then.
Please have a great day. I am not going to flame you.

A three-week delay on simple paperwork is not trivial. At the rates we pay them, I expect better in the interest of our children. It also concerns me that
other things may be "lurking" that we may not even be aware of. Things that may be of more severe consequence than this. Who knows.

2. **Shared Subscriptions and Storage**: Family members can use shared subscriptions like Apple Music Family Plan or a shared iCloud storage plan
without access to each other's personal data or files.
3. **Ask to Buy**: For children’s accounts, purchase requests are sent to the organizer, but this does not allow the organizer to see the child's existing

angry. The need for the RO as recent as January, is a demonstration of that dynamic, and yet you act as if that was not serious or your actions did not
really warrant one based on your continued assertions that your story is correct.
Your reference to $$$ spent is another scare tactic to acquiesce to your desire to structure everything to maximize your outcome, which does not
provide the real protection to me and boys or provide the true and acknowledge what transpired in the marriage and family dynamic. If the truth is
not revealed, I have lost that protection.

Id like to understand what you are saying. I don’t get what you mean. I am not trying to scare you in the least. I am trying to work with you.
The RO that I offered and the apologies I made are real and authentic. Please stop saying the opposite of what I am confirming in writing again here.
May we please talk about this? I have assured you that I won’t argue. I just want to understand your perspective so we can partner safely for the kids.

I appreciate the bags of garbage you sent instead as a funny joke. It was hilarious, but I’ve been trying to get these for months now so it’s loosing its

You’ll always say you are making progress, but still don’t give them to me. Just unplug the ones in use and give me the sub still in the box. It’s so easy.
Please let me have my own property back.

I have repeatedly said do not send anymore things to my place that are in the garage or the IT closet I can find mails for you. Until we settle the house,

When we pay for Adrian it will require from bank account that has cash and not a credit card.
We will have tuition, study skills and bus.
I saw the fidelity account has about 15k, so I could link it to that account.
BofA only has 4k, which we will need for expenses. Mortgage will also be due soon. My next paycheck is end of week.

I have repeatedly said that I was not on board with your Cabo plans that would give you three vacations with them in a row. You have been aware of
that for months now so buying tickets is immaterial to me. This totals to 3 for Mom and 0 for Dad since July.
Kids, I acknowledge your assertion. I plan on following a Parenting Plan. We are supposed to have a temporary one in place immediately following
your divorce filing. Today, after working with child-focused professionals, I have shared five with you in six months.
Cabo Time Share- wrt community property, this turn is mine. You canceled my October trip when we agreed to make plans for Elsa's wedding. It was
my turn then, so we don't just skip me. You also went to Hong Kong and Universal Studios as a secret surprise to me.

What i have been trying to do since the divorce filing was reach agreement with you in a way that minimized involvement of 3rd parties, but structure
an agreement that demonstrated the seriousness of what transpired and what needs to happen to move forward to provide safety for all.
After your outburst on Sunday, and continuing demand I file charges, and lack of true accountability, I stepped back and reevaluated the totality of
what transpired in the relationship and your continuing behavior to me. While I have been focused on substance abuse and protecting against that, as
that is what I recognized and was familiar with, the domestic violence aspect experienced by kids and I was truly never acknowledged. I have done
extensive reading on this subject now and how PP should be structured.
I now realize that my approach was wrong, and my initial efforts were actually short sighted, as it did not set up a plan for long term healing and
potential positive outcomes.
I will have my lawyer reach out to yours to provide our thoughts on next steps.

Should we chat?
It feels like we’ve veered so far off track that finding our way back seems almost impossible. Our love once blazed as brightly as the stars, but that same
energy now powers a relentless cycle of hate and disdain.
Every week, I suggest trying something new, anything to help us see the good in each other again and build a life our boys would be proud to emulate.
I’ve been pushing for us to keep things civil, and you say you are tired of the endless fighting. Yet, somehow, things keep spiraling every day, with each
of us only seeing perspectives from our POV.
We both know this isn’t working, and no therapist would disagree. What do you say we take a moment, step back from the chaos on the dancefloor,
and look at where we are from the balcony?
Maybe it’s time to consider healthier paths, anything different from the mess we are in now. Every week, we agree this does not work. Every week we
still find common ground. Then every week we abandon that and fight even harder. I'd like to discuss this with a cooler head if you would.
Thanks!

Thanks for the info. Then obviously I won’t go either. It is unfortunate that “your plan” has made you the single conduit between Max and I. This

So under your “self proclaimed, child centered” approach your plan pencils out to less than 24 hours a year. Curious to see  if the mediator or judge
agrees that your omnipotent approach is consistent with best practices in a divorce.

Interrogative statements are noted with the symbol "?" at the end of the sentence. If you look at that symbol and work backward, you will see that I
did not ask for anything about Max. I actually asked, "So, I do nothing now?" Mind letting me know on the 4th try now?
Also, per the thoughts on Max noted below, are we following the Dr Brown plan as you propose to assert here? The last I saw was that you were
rejecting that and were coming up with a plan based on your internet browsing instead of Dr Brown's professional advice.
Letting me know what you are doing might be helpful for the children's sake.
Regarding your plan, I'd also like to know when I will actually see Adrian again.
Please advise on since you brought up the topic. Looking to co-parent with you.

I can't seem to get an answer from you on almost anything we are trying to do together, so I pulled some of the most pressing concerns into one of our
familiar "running list" formats that works well for us. Please see below. I do need some things answered today. Have a great day!

can coordinate our commitment. What is the plan for tomorrow?   
AD visit Time- You have clawed back almost all the Dr. Brown recommended approved visits. She noted that Adrian wanted to see me even a month
ago. When do I get to see him again as she said he needed? 
Restraining Order- The version that frivolously states I am a "credible threat to do physical harm" has been filed for months. What is your plan to
remedy the false public portrayal of my character? 
Parenting Plan- Our journey includes five therapists and six parenting plans, beginning with the one I wrote and shared on Sept 22. No, predictability
is destructive to our kid's mental health. What are your next steps?
Spring Break- We had a plan that Dr Brown sanctioned for me to have this one. You ignored it along with the parenting plan. I proposed a healthy,
child-focused compromise. What is your response?
Dr. Brown- You said she was not able to offer an appropriate parenting plan because she was uninformed after 10 meetings. We both offered you the
opportunity to educate her. Do you plan to do that?
Returning Sonos- We communicate weekly on this, and you assure me you will get these to me. You sent me trash instead of the Sonos in January.
What are your plans to get these to me as promised?
3rd Party emails- You are blocking me from co-parenting with 3rd parties via the RO to co-parent unless you need me to reverse Adrian's SAAS
rejection, which I miraculously did. Can I participate on these?
Xfinity- Every day, I send you screen captures of the alerts you send me via Xfinity. These were the basis for your surveillance claims. You won't stop
creating the situation months later. Is this on purpose?
Drop-In- You're aware you still have drop-in audio and video capabilities to surveil me. I send you screen captures of your recent call attempts that
you deny doing. I've asked that we stop this. How do we stop?
Andy Benjamin- We agreed in writing that we would see him as our divorce counselor at Dr. Brown's recommendation. Your RO prevents us from
doing that. Are you backing out of that commitment?
OFW expectations- You have this list of questions because you read my co-parenting requests to coordinate child-centered or property-focused
topics, but don't reply. Is there a plan to replace OFW? 
Please consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a
false RO you mistakenly filed. The impact is that we are not able to co-parent in a child-centered way or resolve ongoing property situations in a
timely or amicable way.
I want to work with you to determine how we do this in the best interest of all involved and in a cost-effective way that does not require an attorney
to send an attorney the same question I already sent you. That seems frivolous, expensive, and unnecessary, so I hope we can reach a more amicable
and less expensive solution.
Please advise, and have a great day!

Good Morning-
I can't seem to get an answer from you on almost anything we are trying to do together, so I pulled some of the most pressing concerns into one of our
familiar "running list" formats that works well for us. Please see below. I do need some things answered today. Have a great day!
Robotics Breakfast-   I was planning to buy bagels, cream cheese, yogurt and silverware tonight. Given Max’s feedback regarding in person viewing
which I shared, I did not plan to attend the competition this weekend.
AD visit Time-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Restraining Order-   I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Parenting Plan-  I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Spring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Dr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like.
Returning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous
nature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely.
3rd Party emails- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
Xfinity-  Please provide evidence I will not stop creating the situation months later. Xfinity told me this is an impossible scenario. Please stop
monitoring our internet.
Drop-In-  PLEASE UNPLUG THE DEVICES. I have communicated to you on numerous occasions I do not know what is happening and have not
made any attempt to drop in on you.
Andy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.
Even under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO?
OFW expectations- OFW will be the platform.
Please consider that I am working with you on the platform of your choice and following the agreed-upon rules of both OFW communications and a
false RO you mistakenly filed. The impact is that we are not able to co-parent in a child-centered way or resolve ongoing property situations in a

Ok.., "a running list" invite was sent so we save the very limited OFW minutes. If we use OFW, we are down to ten minutes for the rest of the month
so it does not make sense.
Below are my official thoughts, but let's please just keep this nice, constructive, and child or property-centered. I have no desire to fight nor do you
with me i'm sure, Christine.
Thanks!
Robotics Breakfast- I was planning to buy bagels, cream cheese, yogurt and silverware tonight. Given Max’s feedback regarding in person viewing

in his best interest to see his father and he wants to. Beyond this week I am happy to wait for the week as noted>>
Restraining Order- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.<<This has been months. The RO filed is false and
frivolous. Do we have to ask your lawyer to fix this, or is this something that you should do on your own because it was either a mistake or unethical?

Parenting Plan- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week. <<This has gone on since September. Six times. Since I
don't expect you will ever do this at this point, can you at least let me know what your plan is prior to responding?>>
Spring Break- I disagree we arrived at Spring Break plan with Dr. Brown. I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week.
<<We disagree. I will find mails on OFW discussing this. We can also speak with Dr Brown about our discussion. Either way there are no current
plans for Spring Break, so I hope we find a peaceful child focused compromise as discussed>>
Dr. Brown- Dr. Brown is not engaged for any further assistance. We have not aligned on any further assistance on what that might look like. <<We
have. It is in the last email. Do you need me to forward so you can see the next steps that she suggested? I also know you said after reading the internet
you would be crafting a new parenting plan instead of Dr. Brown's. Is that your position still?>>
Returning Sonos- The “trash” was items packed up from the guest bedroom. None came from a trash can, but in your piles. Given the dangerous
nature of where the Sonos are, I will need to analyze how to retrieve safely. <<you are talking about 1/3 of the Sonos. I have asked to take a picture
and give me the other 2/3. I would also just like to grab them as proposed. You have said every week you needed help, it was scheduled. It is never true.
Just let me do it please. This is low hanging fruit.>>
3rd Party emails- I saw the e-mail from Lisa yesterday. Lisa asked we respond within a week. <<We are on them now and I need to be able to co-parent
effectively. Please tell me what we're doing so we don not do any further further damage like the whole SAAS situation we teamed up to fix>>
Xfinity- Please provide evidence I will not stop creating the situation months later. Xfinity told me this is an impossible scenario. Please stop
monitoring our internet. <<Let's work this out
peacefully. If your contention is, I am monitoring you when you are the origin of the alerts, we can clear that up pretty quickly. But if you are still
accusing me of surveilling you, I need to take action, right?>>
Drop-In- PLEASE UNPLUG THE DEVICES. I have communicated to you on numerous occasions I do not know what is happening and have not
made any attempt to drop in on you. <<They are not plugged in. I told you that. You know that. But I can not unplug my phone, so your drop-in
calls are still showing there. I have shown you this. You are aware that you still send drop-in requests to audio and video monitoring devices that you
sent me to use. I show you this. Let's just peacefully resolve as I suggested>>
Andy Benjamin- The communication we had was that I asked you to confirm with your lawyer the RO would allow that type of communication.
Even under the modified communication protocols. Did you confirm how his plan would align with RO? <<I told you that it does not align. You
know that well and good. How can we communicate email only if by law you don't let me do that. This is not a mystery. The RO needs to afford for
us to communicate. You don't allow that.>>
OFW expectations- OFW will be the platform. <<Why aren't we going with the arrangements that you have signed off on twice as we have talked
through them at great length? We are back here chasing our tails. We need the email options we discussed with 3rd parties, to strategize about 3rd
parties, communicate with SAAS, Basketball, Robotics, etc... , and we need it to use Andy. If you are intentionally keeping me from effective
parenting, similar to the SAAS situation, I hope you will reconsider. Please work for a more effective and reasonable solution so we can serve the
children's best interests>>

This isn’t really fair to me as a coparent. I’m trying to get some information because all this starts early in the morning and you are not going to get
back to me in time. You are intentionally not allowing me to coparent at all at this stage. Nothing... even on the event that i set up. I am the one who
signed up for it.
And you are an acting as the sole go between Max and I. It’s not combative or controversial questions. And i set it up, but you have blocked me from
being involved now. Allowing me to understand how I can participate in a constructive capacity is not too much to ask given you built this barrier.
And given the timing and disregard for our agreement for communication it is urgent to get clarity. My relationship with my son. And my
commitment to the school that I had to work miracles on to get Adrian into after your way got him rejected are super important to me. It was to you
too, when you asked me to fix it. This is unfair Christine.
It’s a simple, quick conversation. That’s it.

You insisted we connect over phone so as not to use up OFW minutes
I told you repeatedly I wanted to get off the phone and NO to your request. Probably 30 times I said no. I then got upset after I clearly stated my
boundaries, and communicated I had boundaries. You then said, see, your reaction!
For Max, we clearly discussed plan for am. I said I did not need any additional help.
In regards to your communication with him, it has been communicated to you for months now, reunification therapy is needed.
That has not happened.

Drop in. I am not dropping in on you.  
<<Thank you for the reassurance but I don't feel great tbh. I see the attempts, screen capture them, share that instant, and ask about them. Just as I do
the constant daily Xfinity alerts that your ISP sends me. As explained before, the devices you used to drop in on me were in active use, going back to
our Beach days as a family. They were the two cam/audio Alexa devices that we used when we could not find our phones. The Kirkland home
initiated these calls from either the Kitchen or your office. Everyone in our family knows this and has used it. This will never be up for debate and the
kids can both explain it. 
If you have devices that allow me to drop in, then change permission settings. 
<<I only have these devices because you shipped them to me for my use inside my home instead of in the Kirkland home. I plugged them in and was
simply ignorant you sent me audio/video equipment that would allow you that capability. It honestly felt innocent at the time. I can't change your
permission settings any more than I can change permissions on Xfinity. They are yours. You control them. If it confuses you to understand why
Amazon would not let anybody take over your audio/video drop-in devices just because they physically have them and then allow this, think about
what that means in nefarious situations.>> 
I don’t have access and control to whatever settings you say I have.
<<Thank you for the reassurance. I will look again to verify if that is true. I sent you screen captures that say otherwise as recently as last weekend. But
perhaps you will relinquished that capability this week. That would make me feel better. Note I believe I have unplugged everything you sent me and
only see alerts on my phone. I hope that effectively stops the drop-ins from connecting but not the initiation of the attempt. You own those.  You
recall how livid you were when our proposed RO was a mutual ask to stop this, but insisted if we asked, you would move forward with a DV charges
against me so we could not>> 
If you are insisting I do that, let’s have a third party review my phone records to determine if I am in fact doing that.

<<Thank you for the kind offer. Unfortunately, your phone has zero to do with this. An examination of your phone records would yield as much
useful information as a review of our tax filings. As I have noted, you have devices that are registered to you with indoor audio/video drop-in
capabilities that work just the same if phones were never invented. If you would like a third party to explain that, please feel free. An expert can also
explain the tech behind the Blink cam incident. That is a simple, demonstrably reproducible scenario you can see live today, but you can refuse to see
that demonstrated yourself.>>
If I am as you allege, then I will pay for that review. If I am not, then you pay for it. 
<<I have not alleged anything more than the fact that it is happening. I shared both when it happens and who the devices are registered to- You. I have
no way of knowing if it is you, the kids, or a visitor to the house. Only you are registered as the device owner on the initiating end (your iPhone, office
Alexa, others?) and that they call the receiving end (K-town Kitchen, Beach Office, Beach Deck, my Phone). In my heart, I don't believe you "spy" on
me any more than I spy on you. What good is that to either of us? It's just dumb and really provides no "strategic advantage" to anything we are trying
to accomplish as co-parents.>>
Quick Recap:
- On 10.21, after getting you a phone, I sent you an email (see attached) that said: "Christ... we are so intertwined. We will be sorting this out for
years.... 
    
- You started saying I bugged your phone because of how quickly I replied to you on OFW. This was actually my watch vibrating when you sent me
something.
- You started saying I was tracking your car because somehow I was catching you lying. You misrepresent the truth so often (Boxing Day), your "tells"
are obvious. 
- You maintained the ability to track my car and where I was coming and going in real time. You have assured me you deleted the app and don't use it
anymore. 
- Then we had the cam incident that gave you another reason to say I was spying on you. I apologize for not being more forthcoming and explaining
this in detail. 
- You were super pissed I asked for a mutual "no digital surveillance" agreement. Your response was you would initiate career-ending litigation if I
asked for this. 
- You changed the Kirkland Xfinity plan to eliminate my access. As the network admin, you send me daily alerts and below you somehow say "stop
tracking me".
- I began noting the situation mentioned above to you along with screen captures. I explained the tech and told you how we can stop it but you have
made no effort.
- You said I was tracking you since we have a Microsoft family plan. The data on the shared plan has never changed, and you know this because you
paid that bill.
- After hearing about the cam situation in painstaking detail and a series of meetings, Dr. Brown said we both have good points; it's time to move
ahead w/o retribution. 
At present, in addition to the things mentioned above, you can still control the sleep number of my bed and I can control the temperature of the
Kirkland house (which you ask me to help with.) After telling you we have a bunch of things that a smart, digitally connected, and cost-conscious
family would implement to keep the kids safe, discourage intruders, and save money, here we are. My apology for not "re-notifying" you of offline
cams used for visual deterrence resulted in not being able to see my kids and likely irreparable parental alienation. My request for you to share "mutual
digital monitoring protocols" resulted in threats against my livelihood, promised legal retribution, and a false restraining order that says I am a
"credible threat to do you and my kids physical harm" stands to this day. Despite confirming that the RO was both a mistake to file and false, you
refuse to remedy the situation.  
You always criticize me when I spend the time and effort to explain things to you in detail and recount our history. You say it is too much for you to
understand and it makes you mad that you have to spend time reading it and have to come back later. So yes, it did take 30 minutes to write this all
down. But I think it is important to separate fact from fiction, and given the toll it has taken, if you have made it this far,  it might also be worth you
taking ten minutes to read and contemplate we really don't have to keep going down this road. I genuinely want what's best for our kids, and
honestly, I want what's best for you – for the sake of our safety and peace of mind. If you're open to looking at things differently, I'm more than ready
to work together in a positive way.

I apologize for the start of the conversation. I acknowledge I began expressing my sincere concerns. I've been your soulmate for 28 of our 29 years
together, which is a hard habit to break when I see you this way.
I did want to connect to discuss the Robotics situation for reasons I mentioned below and did not want to eat up our limited OFW minutes. I agree.
That clearly triggered you, and you hung up and refused to reengage.
I also agree that you told me "your plans for the activity I signed up for". Reminiscent of signing up to be our kids' father and telling me your plans to
accommodate that role in their lives. I don't get a say in anything.
When you started this, our kids were great with me. I have evidence and history of that, and you have admitted as such. You cherry-pick advice you
want to leverage like it's canon law and ignore anything else.
You know no reunification therapist will touch us because there is no accountability for you, and you still don't let me see the kids 8 months into this.
You also caused months to pass before even Kerri Betts could engage.
So, while you have chosen to supplant me as the Robotics volunteer and father figure, I had additional questions I wanted to ask so I could play some
small part in their lives. But you would not permit that conversation.
I knew this was going to be the case because you are as predictable as the tides, so I called several times to find a way to be in Max's life. You did not
respond till well after the event (over 21 hours) eliminating that.
You found and implemented your own justification for parental alienation as you do daily.

There is no need to fight. Document what you like.

A simple, brief, clarifying phone call where tempers are measured long enough to separate the signal from the noise works wonders! We can stop the
madness of OFW if we so choose.
We just need a calm moment now and then to be sure each other understands what the other is really saying rather than assuming we know what they
are saying. It really does work, Christine.
Please consider affording us that on occasion. I’d even say when we see something we might consider to be inflammatory, maybe we stop OFW before
it gets worse and have a clarifying chat.

No... because I have only done it once since I moved in because it is always so expensive. So I’ve spent $500 when i really needed it after all the
unpacking. But I also get estimates to see if I can do it regularly. And they are always north of $500. So I don’t understand how we pay 1/2 that for 3x
the surface area. Can you confirm the cost with Luis is only $250 every two weeks? I will go with that if so.

Do you know how they work? How do you know sending you a factual data measurement is inflammatory? You can ignore all real world facts- speed
limits, property lines, price tags, luggage weight. It’s your call.
But I’m not sure it shows anything more than the fact you just don’t understand how it works. If you would like me to explain, it’s a brain dead

Hey-
I’m not getting a courtesy response anymore so I realize there is no way I’m getting these back in real life. It’s been a couple months, probably 30
emails, and many promises of “today” “this week”, etc...that you were going to give them to me.
So it’s clear you won’t take a moment from your social life to let me get them under your supervision outside the house. That’s fine, but I’m done
playing Charlie Brown to your Lucy. So to help our relationship out I’m going to just buy brand new.
One is the sub, that’s about $800. And the other three are play 5 speakers (the only ones I bought) which run around $800 each. I’ll attach the cart
and price info. So when we start splitting things you keep those, and I’ll keep these. It’s $3.3k and we are even.
Just documenting because the replacement cost on these ten year old speakers is a fortune. But that’s the only way to do this unless I can find another
angry but reasonable ex-wife who wont give them back but is willing to sell for the 1k they are worth.
Hope we can get along now. 
Thanks!

This afternoon I would like to see Adrian since it’s been well over a week since we have had time together. But you count skiing w/ him as work, that
is not “quality time”. Unlike my coaching. And I have no way to discuss as you don’t answear OFW anymore.
Another week passes. Another week of complete and utter parental alienation. I understand in your mind it’s justified and even though we were all

But this is, without question, a reflection on your true ability to make child focused decisions in Max and Adrian’s best interests. And the alienation,

mentally abusing our children as you work your way to the bottom of the barrel because no professional, child focused professional supports your
side. Opinion shop all you like, but it’s still ongoing mental abuse.
Your story and justification for child abuse has twisted and evolved since July. Booze, mushrooms (you did), DV, multiple accusations of monitoring
(8?). This is all while you maintain drop in functionality on me, and persist in sending me alerts on what’s happening on your network that I have
asked you to stop for months to falsely say I’m monitoring you. You won’t stop.
That is pretty much the totality of what happened unless you want to dig deeper on the incident that triggered your change of tune from the “Alyssa
model” to “Sherman’s March to the Sea”. So as you and your child focused attorney focus on a solution that stops the child abuse you continue to
justify I’m not confident in your ability to make sound decisions.
They say “3rd times the charm”, right? Well this will be the 7th time. And that’s if your higher wisdom is accepted as canon law with zero negotiation
back with a parent that has the same legal rights you have. May I suggest you pause your child abuse until you come down from the mount with the
stone tablets from god? Or google searches and your lawyer.
You realize this could never be a movie. People would walk out after the third try because the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th would seem so abusive to the
kids and implausible in real life it would be a waste of time to sit through. Unfortunately our kids are not only sitting through it, they are living it. I
look forward to the explanation and education for why this is healthy.

I did not say crazy.
I said the therapists we/I have spoken to over course of many years raised serious concerns regarding conduct and safety.
Me and kids are now engaged with therapists to address the impact on overall mental and emotional wellbeing, how to heal, and how to structure
future support to be safe.
In regards to Therapists that raised serious concerns. There was a variation of feedback strongly advising the need for legal police intervention.
How to structure plans moving forward is now being directly addressed to ensure complete safety.
Conversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he communicated to her in an honest and open environment was
incredibly brave and I need to respect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made it clear to me if she believes
he is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That is her obligation.
This is similar to the obligation Yurishka was put in. You have a different perspective, but professionals have a duty to act when they are made aware
of certain situations.
AnnaLisa will be talking to Lisa. How we move forward will be dependent on how you receive the information and what you believe will be in best
interest of boys. We will see.

Could you send me the 2023 tax statement for the Fidelity account I don’t have access to with the msft stock?
I need to do the mock tax return to estimate our payment due. It will need to be paid by April 15th. In years past this has been anywhere from 20k to
80k depending on stock sales and vests for the year. We discussed in past email but just a reminder.

That said, what I said yesterday I meant. The kids we brought into this world with so much hope for forever as a happy family, are still our number
one priority.
I’m % committed to the best for them. It’s just a matter of figuring out who represents their “voice” best since they don’t seem to say the same thing!
And I really hope we can put our differences aside long enough to be the best we can be for their benefit. They didn’t ask for this and don’t deserve it.

That doesn’t have anything to do with the topic we are discussing. You know that. Plus, you’ve been involved with them. I don’t want to be drawn

And I’m trying to honestly figure out who said visits have to be supervised. We always look at their qualifications together, and consider how well
they know our kids. So please share the expertise.
I mean after all, who would’ve thought that Dr. Brown was not qualified? She met with us over 10 times in 3 1/2 months. Did two parenting plans
and has a PhD. But clearly she’s not capable of that decision.

Also... Nanna has obviously been asking to see the boys since long before your girls trip to New York. Remember, we were going to try and time it so
you were out of town, but you killed that. And of course we see The Moyers every year. Both Michael and Robyn and Beth are regular visits. We
always go visit our extended family.
So given that you took the boys to go visit your whole family and then made a decision to divorce me after talking to your mom, when do the boys get
to see my side of the family? Obviously, if it requires you, that’s fine. I took your whole family to Whistler and had an amazing time. It works great!
Given we both are really trying to work hard to make sure the boys have the best and most supportive family experience, but they have been utterly
cut off from my family while I’ve enabled yours, please build that into the parenting plan.

So you repeatedly refuse to answer my question but then start a new thread with this question about the "five" and ask over and over so we don't have

Speaking of replacements, since you decided to cancel my Cabo trip in October then banked my credit for the room during the best week of the entire
year, please advise when you will book an equivalent experience for me. I’d like to get that sorted pretty quickly. And given that you’ve taken all the
time to go ahead and book more Cabo vacations for yourself, I’m sure you can make this a priority.
I’m gonna tell you an advance, I don’t really care to hear about “subject to availability” issues that you may face. My vacation in October was not
subject to availability. I paid over 50 K to have that week not ever have a “subject to availability” issue. You took that from me. So “subject to
availability” may be your problem. But please do not expect to make it my problem.
Obviously, I don’t wanna go in the hot months of summer. I will be expecting something at peak and of equivalent value. So as a favor to you , I am
open to also discussing replacing that by staying at another place of equal or greater value. Maybe like the one you just did in California. I know you
mentioned it was a five star resort that reminded you a lot of Grand Solmar....
For that matter, we have pretty clear accounting of all your luxury travels here and abroad over the last year. So you should have some really good
ideas. Looking forward to solving this in a peaceful, constructive and equitable way like we did the Sonos.

Thanks for considering either just sitting beside each other or texting during live events like sports, school activities, etc. as being able to communicate
in real time about the things that we are seeing, allows us to make better parenting decisions for the kids future. I will also assure you that, we will limit
it to just that time and just that topic.
But I’ll also call out how successful we were today in coordinating for Adrian when we had an open, two-way communication channel. I’m not gonna
beat a dead horse and point this out to you again, but we seem to have a win on important issue every week when we just stop, chat, agree on action
items, and just get shit done. Never fails.
Looking forward to confirmation of how you would like to do this moving forward. It’s that important.

So, really great play tonight. I like seeing you make more friends with the guys there and it’s obvious you’re getting a little more comfortable. That
allows you to play a little bit looser and with a little bit more confidence. That mental part is super important.
Your hustle was really strong, you get through the picks very quickly, and you understand when a ball handler needs a pick set for himself. You even
had a couple good give and goes flashing under the hoop. Of course, one of those led to an easy basket.

The other thing I really like is your feeling more comfortable about taking your outside shot ( >10 feet. ) From the baseline is always going to be
difficult but it’s something we can work on. It’s a great weapon to have in your bag when you can just nail that.
I also think it would be super to spend some time in either training clinics or camps soon to work on ball handling. With your Hoops IQ, along with
being smaller and quicker, you’re gonna be most successful at either the one or two slot. So let’s train for that.
Keep up the great work, Adrian. You’re doing awesome and it’s amazing to watch you grow as a player and a young man every week.
You really make me proud.

Not pointing fingers. I’m trying to co-parent. This one landed after 11:30 pm. So not sure if we need to see if someone is sneaking up past his
bedtime.
Please don’t make me the bad guy. These alerts are doing just what they are supposed to be doing, so parents can be sure kids are playing by the rules.
All this shit was set up with good intentions so you and I, as responsible parents could use technology and appearances to protect our family and

I’m not putting any details of what just happened into this message because that would be seen as inflammatory and counter  productive to my
sincere efforts, and outreach to try and work constructively with you. I understand the perspective and will do my best to avoid giving you the
impressions you seem to be concerned about. You will see that reflected in my heartfelt communications.
If we have to go through our capable attorneys, our kids will feel a real impact. We have three examples of serious consequences that would have
occurred with Adrian in the last ten days. So I’m asking again, please let me know how we can work together instead of against each other. Let’s find a
way to activate that superpower we shared for three decades.
This is not working and only getting worse. Let’s stop the slide.

When I heard you today I had serious heartfelt feelings for the woman who I have know for 30 years, gave me three wonderful kids, showed me love

Please, I’ve asked for months. We don’t need to go couch shopping or glass blowing, but we have to find a way to simply find the humanity in each

Understood. I was trying to reach out and be kind.In return, may I ask that when we are in front of the kids you stop screaming at me.
Yesterday, like you always did when I was in Bellevue on the Adrian drop offs, you started screaming at me yesterday in front of Max.
With Adrian, you would get out of the car and start yelling at me despite Dr. Brown’s advice that that should never happen with him there.
Yesterday, you demanded therapist names. I said I would speak to Lisa so you pointed your finger and started screaming “we are at war.”
This was with Max, right after a therapy session to check in on how he is doing. In my opinion this causes extreme parental alienation and damage.
I will no longer request you to be peaceful, civil, or constructive given your request. I will however ask you to stop these outbursts in front of our kids.
Thanks for your consideration in the best interest of their mental health.

Yes.
- "ICS" had an Auction.
- SAAS had "SAAS in the City"
I had asked you if we could go to the SAAS event but did not hear back. I am not blaming you by any means, but we should have attended, given we,
as a family, probably have more to be thankful for than almost anyone in attendance. We need 3rd party email.
As such, we desperately need an updated and accurate RO filed if we want to effectively co-parent in the best interest of our children. Nothing we did
at SAAS, Dr Brown, AAU, Keri Betts, and finding Adrian in Kirkland, etc.. could have happened without email.
I realize I hear every weekend it will be fixed "this week," but it never is. So, without getting mad or upset at each other, can you just blame me for your
attorney filing the wrong one? Or you changing your mind repeatedly on what it says and just get it fixed?
None of this should be controversial. I agree you two can both blame me for your actions.

Message 2310 of 4024
Yeah, I get it. It's the same thing every week. It's just insulting to live Groundhog Day over and over. I have used the Charlie Brown & Lucy analogy so
many times that it's gotten tired and worn out. So, let me begin by highlighting once again my intention to engage in a cooperative process focused on
our children's best interests, Max and Adrian. Those two boys and their mental health are my singular concern at this point.
Seven months after I sent you my initial parenting plan, following the instructions of our co-parenting counselor (who you were secretly triangulated
with), we have yet to make progress. This is despite the involvement of five professionals and the creation of six plans consistent with our strategy to
prioritize our children's well-being in a minimally invasive process to establish a our temporary parenting plan.
However, after Dr. Brown's contributions were dismissed due to her purported lack of information and professional qualifications, coupled with the
reflections that involving her was a mistake, indicated a broader and more profound issue. You have a pattern of dismissing professional advice to stall
progress and allow yourself more runway to alienate Max and Adrian further. Thereby creating a false reaffirmation of your self-fulfilling prophecy.
We are months and months into this pattern. It's so well documented that saying otherwise is not worth the airtime. But in Baseball Terms, the
scoreboard reads:
Parenting Plans
- Robert: Six
- Christine: Nil
Excuses for no Parenting Plan
- Robert: Nil
- Christine: ♾
This underscores our imbalance in effort and the missed opportunities to collaboratively establish a plan centered around Max and Adrian's well-
being.
Following our discussion with Ms. Betts and her confirmed unwillingness to contribute to a parenting plan or offer recommendations. A critical gap
emerged in our joint commitment to the well-being of Max and Adrian. A commitment based on the guidance of qualified, child-centered therapists
driven by five therapists, six parenting plans, and the overdue addition of children's voices advocates.
Your approach suggests an unwillingness to cooperate with professionals if their recommendations don't align perfectly with a preconceived legal
strategy to take the kids, a stance made very clear with Debbie Bayer in November. This prioritization of tactics over Max and Adrina's well-being
undermines our collective decision-making process and, most importantly, their best interests.
Your new strategy, however, seems to be taking the voice of parentally alienated, possibly mentally abused children (Max and Adrian) as your primary
input and ignoring the real and lasting damage of your unilateral policies over the last nine months. This feels akin to blindfolding Max and Adrian,
playing my voice while they endure a metaphorical lashing, and using their cries against me to justify your approach.
Relying on this after-the-fact downstream data to support yourself and Google searches that align with your point of view to craft a temporary
parenting plan is inconsistent with our agreed-upon approach. If your new legal strategy replaces Dr. Brown's comprehensive work (3.5 months, 900
meeting minutes, two parenting plans, tens of guidance and recommendations emails), I urge you to reconsider your approach.
Seeing Max on Saturday, his transformation was so profound that I barely recognized him. The experience was incredibly painful. Adrian's shift from
being my "mini-me" to almost no contact dramatically underscores the impact of your parenting decisions. Removing all family photographs and
digital memory frames, which chronicled years of our life together, makes sense. It is your "digital book burning" to erase our shared moments of joy,
to achieve the same abhorrent intent as its traditional counterpart.

I thought this would be a quick reply, but after typing this far, I realize that the gravity of our situation requires a more comprehensive appeal. Your
current trajectory, prioritizing legal strategy over our children's mental and emotional well-being, is deeply concerning. I hope you will consider the
more profound ramifications of our ongoing conflict to Max and Adrian.
Given we are only moving backward, and the children have no father figure, only an evolving villain, I propose we recommit to setting aside our
differences and engaging in meaningful, constructive dialogue. This is in the interest of Max and Adrian's health, happiness, and stability. As Dr.
Brown keeps telling us, let's look forward instead of hurting the kids with personal retribution-based parenting decisions, a pattern I humbly suggest
we unfortunately share.
Are you open to discussing next steps and how we prioritize the well-being of Max and Adrian?

What's going on with our kids? I'd like to see them, obviously, either way.
Since Annalisa couched this as a "tremendous disappointment" if they were not going to board that plane, please let me know how this was handled.
As a co-parent working on their mental health, I'd like to understand the details so I can have an informed discussion with Ms Betts.
Understanding what we are putting them through will be critical to that. She did seem flabbergasted the kids were never told we were getting a
divorce (or I was taking furniture), given how hard they seem to be taking this. Especially Adrian's self-blame and self-destructive feelings.
She is going to be a real asset and child advocate for the kids!

Come on, just send me the request next time. I don't ever push back. Hell,, I even initiated this info exchange without you even asking. I know the

This is becoming a bad divorce parody. It's like she has a spell on you and you don't think for yourself anymore. Then, when you do, it just gets

I hate you are asking me to wait to talk to our Lawyers when we have been told as recently as yesterday that our child is considering self-harm. And it
is documented in this thread that we are quite possibly the primary contributing factors since your actions of July 4th and 5th.
I can't bear the idea of watching an undersized casket lowered into the ground and wishing that our attorneys were not your only go-between for
something that could have saved ADs life. It's so bizarre we could have lost him 36 hours ago, yet today, you roll the dice on purpose.
I'll contact my attorney to understand what you are doing or saying to our children, noting Ms. Betts seemed very concerned to learn how our
situation has never been explained to them. I can't believe you're making me badger you to collaborate on keeping Adrian from killing himself.
Yes, I will definitely speak to my attorney about this. And as a refresher on what I asked for in September, please see below for my proposal you
ignored. And to make things worse, made everything noted as "not to do" your guiding strategy. Which I never understood.
I just reread ... I can't help but think if we had picked my route instead of yours, as you insisted, Adrian would not be thinking of killing himself. Just
think how different our kid's lives would be right now. Blame it on January to feel better, but you ignored this for months prior to that.
All I want is for Max and Adrian to have a safe place for themselves. You have created the opposite. Your parenting decisions are incredibly
disturbing, and I fear they will have lifelong, or as we have been warned now possible life-ending consequences. Sound safe?

______________________ From my Parenting Plan sent to Christine in Sept.______________________
Talking with Max and AD: It’s evident that Max and AD sense that changes are occurring. It’s pivotal that we discuss this matter with them with
utmost care, empathy, and clarity. A conversation where we convey a unified and reassuring message is essential, emphasizing that their well-being is
our top priority.
- Love and Reassurance- They must know our love for both is steadfast. It's vital to reassure them that we will both persistently be a significant part of
their lives. The essence is that no one is being excluded, and no one is "voted off the island."
- Avoiding Blame- We must maintain neutrality in our conversation and refrain from attributing blame to the instigator of this process. It’s crucial to
present the decision as mutual to mitigate distress, irrespective of the underlying dynamics.
- Maintaining Consistency- Ensuring some sense of normality in our separation is crucial for their mental well-being now and in the future. We need
to underscore the consistent elements, like schooling and activities, to foster a sense of stability.
- Encouraging Feedback- Allowing Max and AD to express their thoughts, fears, and uncertainties is essential. Validating their emotions and ensuring
that such feelings are normal, and we are here to support them will be necessary.
- Honesty and Clarity- While it’s unnecessary to delve into the intricate details of our separation, they have witnessed our fights. So, being honest
about the impending changes is essential, and providing the timelines we know will be helpful.
- Living Arrangements- While we have not finalized long-term living arrangements, we should have a near-term plan if the previously defined
arrangements are satisfactory. Clarifying interim plans and assuring them of our continual presence is critical.
- Addressing Concerns- Max and AD might initially be reticent but encouraging them to ask questions and providing honest and reassuring responses
is vital. It’s acceptable to acknowledge uncertainties while demonstrating a united front for them.
Co-Parenting Guidelines: We must portray a united, loving front for Max, AD, and Elsa to ensure they feel they originate from love, not discord,
especially as we navigate through our differences. A collaborative approach will establish a secure environment and reinforce their sense of being
cherished.
- Avoiding Conflict- We must refrain from disagreements in the kid's presence to shield them from unnecessary stress and emotional turmoil. Our
children are not instruments in our disputes; maintaining a peaceful environment is paramount.
- Positive Role Modeling- Demonstrating mutual respect and effective, peaceful communication is crucial. We are tasked with exhibiting behaviors
that promote their social and emotional growth. They will look to us to learn how to behave.
- Prioritizing Their Needs- Ensuring the well-being of our children surpasses any disagreements or conflicts we have is essential. Our commitment to
their needs must be visible and unwavering, transcending our differences.
- Consistent Messaging- Presenting a united front and avoiding contradictory information will provide stability and prevent potential anxieties and
trust issues. Consistency in communication is vital in fostering a secure environment for them.
- Family Time- Regular, supportive dialogue during this will ease smoother transitions and adjustments to new family dynamics and living situations.
The basics provided in the family planning section above should be helpful to this effort.
- Unified Discipline Approach- Supporting consistency in discipline will fortify trust, ensuring our children perceive our unified values and
preventing potential manipulative scenarios. Neither of us should be perceived as the "heavy" or the "softie."
- Family Planning: For the mental well-being of our children during our ongoing separation, we acknowledge the importance of maintaining safe and
respectful shared family time. Christine and I agree that our interactions during these times will be peaceful, especially in the presence of the children.
Any discourse must be private.
Page 610 of 1048


Scheduled Family Dinners- Regularly scheduled family dinners should be arranged to foster stability and create trust for the children's benefit. We
will mutually agree upon the dates, ideally incorporating one weekday and one weekend.
- Event Attendance- Whenever appropriate, we aim to jointly attend events and appointments to show united support for our children, reinforcing
our shared priorities. This will demonstrate that their needs are the number one priority in our lives.
- Shared Responsibilities- We will collaboratively manage responsibilities, such as attending appointments and school events, alternately or as agreed
upon. Due to the chaotic nature of events, ad-hoc arrangements continue to be acceptable.
- Flexibility and Cooperation- We will strive to accommodate unforeseen circumstances and each other’s schedules to maintain a harmonious co-
parenting environment and foster a sense of teamwork. I will accommodate Christine's work conflicts.
- Communication and Advance Notice- Transparent and timely communication is essential. Any information or updates about upcoming events or
appointments should be shared promptly to allow time for schedule adjustments if desired.
- Respect for Boundaries and Time- Mutual respect for time and commitments is crucial. If one parent cannot attend an event, the attending parent
should share relevant information and updates about the proceedings with the other.
- Neutral Debriefings- Post-event debriefings should be conducted impartially and factually to ensure parents are informed and aligned on
subsequent co-parenting decisions. Let's agree on the format as that is 1-1.

I signed us up for the robotics event to be a part of Max’s life, give back to SAAS, and just try and do something good that Max might see and want to
model his behavior after. Similar to how I role model for Adrian as a multi-sport kids coach.
I was the first volunteer for this event. You refused to participate. When I finally twisted to every ask to get you to agree, you summarily used the
wrong RO to cut me out of the event participation despite my asks to be allowed to be a part of this event.
Now, a week after asking you for the same allowance you would not afford here, I’ve asked multiple times to participate with you and Ms Betts on the
kids mental health email discussions and planning. You still will not permit that. Ms Betts watches on.
Please reconsider and allow me to participate. It’s a bigger deal than volunteering for school events. If you  have missed the emails on the kids mental
health (like the 1099 multiple times) or are just too busy when you’re off work to bother, I can provide info here.
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

Let's agree that process is unhealthy or in the kids' best interest. If, we have a concern relevant to their situation and want to discuss with Karri, that is
natural. But let's both agree not to use them as pawns and take her advice out of context to score points. They deserve better.
I think the most pressing issues are:
- Adrian is thinking of self-harm in his current environment.
- Max is unreachable by his father in his current environment.
- We don't have an approved plan to remedy either situation.
You insist you have the kids' best interest at heart and believe eliminating me from their lives is best. I won't question your intentions.
I think the situation you created is contributing to a rapid decline in their mental health and I interpret Kari's feedback to support that.
We can both have our own POV on those areas. And I think that's why healthy co-parenting is so great for the children; they benefit from us both.

My Questions Still Are:

- What the new plans are, and how I can see them during?
- What happens to the actual unit reserved at this point
As you have confirmed that it was sent, can you ask for a copy of the email and share?
Either way, I am requesting the information above yet again. If you are playing games to take the kids on your third consecutive trip and villainize me,
that will come out in the wash. Dr. Brown clearly said that I had this Spring Break and we have documentation that will verify that the only thing to
be resolved was the conditions that would allow you to feel safe. You know that.
I also realize you stalled the clock to the point where arranging for the kids to be with Kevin Otero again has hit the required mark if we include the
secret period of your relationship (assets hidden 7/4 ). So please advise if Kevin Otero will be in the care of my children during the secret trip. I'm

So we talked about the stuff she was not aware of that was going on, but I didn’t get specifics about how to handle a suicide situation. But as I
understand there are steps we should be taking to have a safety plan in place. And even an emergency list of contacts with phone numbers at our
fingertips.
Then we are supposed to be giving him space but also creating a safe environment for open dialog. There are things that I read we should be doing
now that we know. That’s all I wanted to talk to you about so we see and say the same thing so he feels safe.
Does that make sense? Do you have different info? I’d love to swap notes. That is all I am asking to do.
Thank you for responding 
I do want to work together here.

She discussed frequent check ins with him on how he is doing and feeling. If the assessment he is in immediate need for assistance it would be to take
him to the emergency room.
Feeling safe was paramount so we have taken steps so he is not put in a situation where he feels unsafe.

I’m struggling with why you won’t answer that question, Christine. Why wont you work together on what we’re telling the kids? We should not
disparage each other to them, right?
That has been advised since the first court video we watched “What about the Kids” and with every therapists since. So please don’t keep your “Dad
narrative” top-secret?
As mentioned, I feel like there has been a steady drumbeat of parental alienation since this all started. And, yes, that’s just my own POV. But it’s these
things that fuel those concerns.
I know that is not your intent. I know we both only want the best for them. So please help me, help our kids, so we leave them out of adult business
they should be insulated from.
Looking forward to your feedback as your coparent.

Message 2380 of 4024
Of course, I spoke to Adrian. I was walking him to the car, and that is when he discussed not being able to go on Spring Break like all of his friends.
That is when I got the impression it was portrayed as "my fault". If it was not, great. All I can do is trust you, and I appreciate the partnership in their
best interest. Thank you.
I worry when you say things like this: "Asked I don’t verify what you are saying he said.". I feel like Divorce 101 is not putting your kids in the middle
of your crap. I gave the example of when you brought him into our business In Cali and how awful that was for his psyche.
In our final visit, Dr. Brown noted that I needed to "take one for the team" and not explain what happened with the cam to him. I did, and I have
never brought it up since. As I have said, the kids are not supposed to be a part of this. It is our business and our fault.  
So, getting them to "verify" statements for you to triangulate is a horrifying thought. Please don't make me ask you not to put them in the middle. If
we disagree, can we at least sidebar with someone ASAP? If we disagree there, it is a big problem. 
Please see the attached for the warnings I sent in Jan. This is not a mystery. I  saw this a mile away, told you about it, and asked to partner, but you
insisted on your plan instead of professional recommendations. I really wish we had worked together back then.   
I am also unsure why you would cancel Cabo. I asked for two dinners—three total hours at most over a full week. I was going to stay far away and not
see you. I don't get why taking away the entire vacation I take AD to every year, with you guys joining later, is good parenting.. 
It honestly feels like you would do anything to them to punish me. I hope that is not true. 
I would still like to see them as requested. That has not changed, so please let me know. 
The number did not work. See attached. You can see multiple failed calls. Please don't try so hard to be "correct" on everything that you feel the need
to point out that someone in the tech industry for 30 years can't recognize when a phone number does not work. That doesn't make sense.  
But I finally got through when I called the lady who I worked with on the "30-person weeks" you booked for someone else during the prime season
after saying I had them this year. I'd love to understand what the heck that is and what we got in exchange so I can use it, too. Just let me know what's
up. honestly, please   
And so what was April the 13th? Is that the other Presidential at Grand Sol Mar? Please don't tell me that you had that during prime time and just
canceled it w/o offering it to me after you said I had it this year and next. I was on the phone with them last week to figure out how to get into Sol
Mar, and it's obviously impossible to do.
So if we had that, given you know what that means to me, and just killed it, that is an extraordinarily vengeful and malicious thing to do. Doing
nothing would have been easier and I would have loved it. But you purposely went out of your way not to let me have something nice. 
This whole thing is so far out of hand now, Christine. I would love to find a way to peacefully uncouple and help the kids. They don't want us to hate
each other. Can we just start playing nicely together? I'm not asking to be friends, but let's please partner to co-parent. We don't have to hate and
want to destroy one another. There is a better way that we won't regret for years to come. Please consider it. 
Q's:
- Can I see our children over their spring break?
- Can you explain the confusion on the Time Share?

You had this week at Rancho and could have used it this week. You called and cancelled it. You indicated it was burned. They confirmed it was not
and you cancelled, and available to rebook subject to availability.
Next week, you said it was burned. I called and they said no, so I cancelled it so it was not burned. It is still available to use this year, and you need to
rebook subject to availability. As I called late Friday, if you want to try rebook call first thing Monday am.
Rancho is always available.
As indicated previously it is best to book one year out, so if you know your weeks in 2025 for 2 bedroom, you should book it.

Obviously it will make me uncomfortable to say how are you doing? What’s going on? So do you have any suggestions on how we can co-parent the
situation together? I don’t wanna feel like I am asking him to be a spy or something like that. Please know I am asking with a sincerest of intentions.
And if you feel uncomfortable, because you feel like I’m trying to create some sort of narrative, that is not in any way, my intention. And I will

that is all.
I will offer what I think, I think you let them know that it’s OK to talk about this and it’s not a big secret from dad . We are in this together and we are
putting them first in our lives. They are not in the middle and dad and mom are not gonna fight about anything that you’re doing.

Christine, I am not trying to fight with you. No matter what I’m not trying to fight with you. So let’s please at all cost do not raise the temperature in

I think the expectation that I should be able to talk with my children at a bare minimum is not me putting you in an unreasonable situation. It’s not as
visitation.
And my sincere hope is to not put them in the middle of a situation like we have done in the past . I’m looking for a safe way to coparent with you.
If your expectations is that I don’t get to talk to them until next Saturday I think that’s asking a lot . And even then, I don’t know what I can say.
Let’s please not fight . Let’s find a healthy way to just discuss this really quickly. Let’s put them first. I promise to follow your advice. Teamwork!
It is not an emergency, but it is somewhat urgent since it’s already Thursday . Please let me know when you can chat at your convenience. Thank you

I never said you could not talk to them. You are already developing a narrative which is false.
I should have not responded as now you are stating things that are not true.
The statement that “we” not put them in the middle like we have done in the past, is inflammatory.
You have already put out a narrative to the lawyers and Karri about me withholding or doing things that are not in their best interest, when
professionals have stated the exact opposite.

When you are keeping secrets and they are asked to be in the middle by having conversations with me, it’s putting them in the middle. I am asking for
a way to put them first above our own mess.
I am asking to have a short conversation with you about it rather than put it into OFW so it cannot be Weaponized given your fear . I’m doing
everything in my power to try and coparent safely.

I mentioned when you were explaining your perspective on our past at Kari’s , that I have come to agree with much of your assessment. And now I
am increasingly more inclined to look at the past through your eyes. You were sober and wanted the best for the family, us, and frankly me most of all.
You did your level best and I am forever grateful to you for that.
I may have been angry at the way things went down, and not getting the chance to continue our positive trajectory, but that’s my problem. Not
yours. All I saw was that our life finally seemed happy to me. I was finally making in roads with Max, AD and I were peas in a pod. And you and I, i
had never in our entire 30 years been happier or more hopeful.
But you had a change of heart. It was too late. I missed the last train leaving the station and you and the kids were on it . That’s not your fault. I was
the one who got drunk and lost my ticket. You did all you could to be sure I’d make it. I can be bitter and point fingers but we both were there. We
both know who is at fault. It was me and I have to accept that.
So... if I am weaponizing this thread, I guess I have some splaining to do, because this is not exactly a ringing endorsement for me...
Attached is what I see for the beavers. 
I think you are good. Hope you are having fun.
Message 2427 of 4024
Sooo.... It was a contentious call and we needed to go toe to toe on some things we disagree on but the gold is mined when we realize that nothing
constructive will come from those arguments.
I own what I did, you own what you did. We can both share immutable facts and color them with our own narrative. The question is if there is more
harm than good that comes from that public declaration.
Correlation is not causation. But someone else (Conner) will decide if it’s more than correlation and if one of us is truly at fault for the difference in
our family today vs the last day in June.
So I’m not really interested in assigning blame. I want the problem fixed. I want to get our kids back on track, including a relationship with me that
any court will want to see a path to as healthy.
I’m not saying we have to be friends, I am asking that for our kids parents that we appear to be. We need to start behaving normal. Going on like this
is counterproductive and unhealthy.
So you said you would think about it. On the plus side you say you will give it some consideration. On the negative side, you say that every time. So I
have to temper my hopes for a better future.
I can suggest a process and perhaps some tangible next steps or deliverables so we partner instead of plaster each other. It’s not going to be easy, but
the alternative is likely far worse and public.
I will be reasonable in waiting on your decision within reason. I’ve sent this same note too many times to be strung along without results again. The
Charlie Brown & Lucy metaphor just falls flat now.
So I’d like to know your thoughts. If you have changed your mind, just let me know and we can man our battle stations. But I hope you see I’m trying
to do right by you as you deserve.

what.
I want to make it clear that is something I would consider. I just want to take a look at it. I tried to have a good discussion about it but that didn’t
work.
I have also tried to call you back several times to try and make sure you got the tax files. I think I have them, but I need permission to send them to
you.
In both cases, I am just trying to help and trying to cooperate. I keep extending an olive branch and you keep saying that you just have to crucify me.
Well, I don’t understand that I want to make it clear that I’m willing to listen. I also prefer that you not to turn the kids against me as you suggested.

This is from Conner’s doc. The way I read this is that all relevant emails and texts that pertain to the parenting issues being evaluated would be
considered important documents to be turned over as part of the evaluation process. Just my take.
Connor is looking for comprehensive information to assess our situation. So any communications that provide insight into our parenting dynamics,
decisions, and interactions are relevant. Based on what you shared last week, I assume you agree.
So my ask is that since all of this is going to be publicly available, is if it was worth it to establish scope & subjects that are or are not relevant. That’s all.
I’m not doing anything nefarious. If you agree, I’d love to work together and not blow each other.
Obviously we need to ask our attorneys if this is a correct interpretation. Agree?

Let me know if you would like me to forward Email.
I think the data points we have now are:
- What Dr Brown told us AD said
- What you think Dr Brown should have really said
- What Kari told us AD said
- Alan visitation report one
- Alan visitation report two
I assume these make up the algorithm that collectively drive our decisions for our time together.
Does that sound right? Am I missing anything?
Thanks!

I’ll work on Elsa today. I might call for help.
What are we short and when is it due? I tracked to Annalisa’s ask exactly so don’t know this.
Why do I need to move my medical bills out of BofA? Is BofA only for bills you pay?
I thought we had agreed to continue with our 29 year arrangement. I fund, you pay?
I’ll try and find the lot history.
Btw- this is much easier than the attorney pipeline that costs several $k for each request that still seems to get it wrong based on AnnaLisa’s last ask.

If we are honest, we are doing a running list meeting in email. Which is slow and cumbersome but way better than the super expensive and ineffective
attorney pipeline we are using.
When we consider that, along with the huge Conner miscue we had, and our pledge to start working together again, might we consider that format
again? We did not fight in that context.
I think we have disregarded it because I was asking you things. But now that you are making requests of me, we are doing it again. If we did that once
a week we would save a ton of cash and effort.
Can we try it again to see if we can make it work?

Child support is a formula based on income I believe.
Spousal is based on negotiation as is split of assets.
I am running some models on what above and split looks like so I can estimate my budget. Ultimately we will both be responsible for our own spend
that will tie into our split of assets and whatever income we separately have, factoring in child support and spousal support.
I proposed a split as well. The biggest we will need to align on is house.
If you put your personal spend on your cc you can start tracking your personal spend.
Can you send me the March Fidelity statements?

What AnnaLisa sent was the major bills. It noted a shortfall in the account of 3,500 even if those were the only items paid out of BofA. They are not.
Your medical premium is one example that comes out of BofA. Mine comes out of my paycheck which is deposited into that account. Car insurance
for both cars comes out as do bills for community property.
My salary will never be enough to cover the bills so we need constant injection into the account
Mortgage is 4,800. I pay before 20th
Tuition is under 6k due on 20th.
I try keep the spend in BofA to kid related items or house which is community property.

"My salary will never be enough to cover the bills so we need constant injection into the account."
- We both know this. We have lived well beyond our means for our entire marriage. You also said yesterday it was OK to tell Katharine and Mira (my
two best references for future employment) I was an abuser because I "retired". You also said you did not pursue DV before so I could get a job. But
now you are, with that intent.
So now that you are making it near impossible for me to find employment now or in the future, you can say "mission accomplished". I am happy to
work with you constructively to figure out how to make your salary work since I am retired, and you are blackballing me at both MSFT and Google.
My core job targets.
"I try to keep the spend in BofA to kid-related items or house which is community property."
My house is the same as the one you are in. Same with insurance. I am not sure how you are defining community property and you dd not answer my
question:
"Why do I need to move my medical bills out of BofA? Is BofA only for bills you pay?  I thought we had agreed to continue with our 29-year

Obviously I am not a lawyer, but this is what I understand to be the case ... everything becomes legally binding when our divorce is finalized in
September this year... open to being wrong.
In the state of Washington, the division of community property is typically determined during the divorce proceedings, and this can involve
mediation if the parties choose to resolve their issues outside of court.
The decisions made in mediation about the division of community property become effective once they are formalized in a legally binding document,
often referred to as a “Marital Settlement Agreement” or “Property Settlement Agreement.” However, for these decisions to be legally enforceable,
they usually need to be approved by the court. Once the agreement is incorporated into the final divorce decree and the divorce is finalized by the
court, the division of property as agreed upon in mediation is then legally effective and binding.
So, while parties may agree upon the division of community property during mediation, this division doesn’t go into effect until the divorce is
officially granted by the court and the agreement is entered into the court order. It’s also important for individuals to follow the specific court orders
and local rules, as procedural requirements may vary. Consulting with a legal professional familiar with Washington state divorce law would provide
the most accurate guidance for an individual’s specific situation.

Acknowledging that you are playing your "hang up" game. The way this goes is we have something important and urgent, you hang up and refuse to

I am asking that we treat AD's threats of self-harm seriously enough to discuss while we still have context. Especially given that your only response is
"I'll monitor." Please reconsider your refusal to work with me on our child's mental health.
I'll note that this is important because Kari seemed quite surprised to hear about your decision to cut off contact with me last time because of a single
comment in "one session in". So I'm not sure you are making the right decisions here.
Please consider acting more urgently and working with me on decisions of this magnitude, given your history on much less urgent issues.

Ok. I tried calling again, but you still won't pick up. Assuming you are trying to scoreboard for Annalisa instead of making an effort for Adrain.
Given the situation and the context I am providing, I hoped you cared enough or realized that you are not trained in children's mental health issues
well enough (especially of this magnitude). But it does not seem like you do either.
My issue is you have seized 100% control of the kids. You are their only input, and they are rapidly declining on your watch. Executing "your plan"
despite the guidance of multiple mental health professionals does not appear to be going great. We went from best buds with me as the primary
caregiver to thoughts of self-harm on your watch. I'll share a few examples I have seen.
You can dispute that you have something to do with this, but you can not dispute I have offered multiple times to pursue a more peaceful,
harmonious, child-focused alternative. You probably should also concede that you have refused those offers every time out of hand. If neither trained
professionals or my offers for a more peaceful route can get through, I am at a loss with you.
Please let me know if you will reconsider.

P.S. I asked Kari about Max's next appointment today. He does not have one, I guess, which makes the incident at the one-and-only session even more
impactful. I really wish you had not started screaming, "WE ARE AT WAR," while wagging your finger in my face on the way to our cars till he
physically took you away. I fear that it will have a devastating impact on our relationship.

Lately, you seem to be very focused on MY discretionary spending. And you have specifically called out my occasional massages. Which I am pretty
sure are always <$100. I don't get it. See attached.
We can note the cost is the same as a couples massage, which is what I asked you about but, you did not answer. This appears to be $360 every ten
days or approximately $13,140 annually for you.
Is this really the right fight to pick?

In the interest of working constructively together, please clarify our standing. It is all community property with tens of K's of our assets you are
shuffling around w/o being transparent with me.
I'll also note by killing the reservations this year (after you killed October), I fear you have pushed any opportunities past where I might be employed
if I can get a job, and I can't really use them.
You are a whiz at this. The best I have ever seen tbh. None of this would come as a surprise to you so I assume it was all intentional. I don't get that.
It's much more work to screw me, right?

"Then there is also the reality of situations that arrive on the fly like Elsa this AM. At this point, the fact that she blames me for her entire childhood
and you were just a bystander may be a deal breaker for her and I. Historically we spoke with one voice. Hell, I think July 5th came to a head because I
was defending you. But it's a big deal that may mean we don't talk again for years. We are quite literally crashing and burning. "
So, we noted a couple of months back that you had been lying to me about Elsa. You said she was unaware of our situation (even while we did the
beach move), but it turns out you had been backchanneling with her for weeks then.
When she exploded on me based solely on your perspective, it was a sad and painful unraveling of my time as her father since I met you two or three
decades ago. Just like your plans to divorce, your plan to eliminate my kids hit hard.
As I try to figure out how to either undo the story you tell as the single truth, or at least share things that actually made up our life in all its fullness, I
want to know what you are doing with her now so I can address your collusion with her.
We have tens of emails documenting lies about what you were doing, so I am asking you to be honest about what is going on now. She's had no
contact for months, so I assume all is going according to your plan for all 3 kids at this point.
So before I reach out can you give me an honest update of what you are doing with her and if I am not asking the "exact right question" what you have
already done? I don't need a recap of the previous lies. I know those. Just an update.
thanks!

situations. I just want feedback.
There is no guidance that says that one parent should demand a child adopt their narrative of their past as a healthy path forward. This all happened
on your watch, your plan.
Please let me know when we can have the discussion. It is super important to me.
Message 2507 of 4024
So... I am super bummed that I have to send this to you instead of discussing it because after agreeing to talk about the situation with me again, you
refuse to. You said his spiral into self-destruction is entirely my fault. And I am the sole reason Adrian is having problems. I asked that we peacefully
and constructively discuss things we could consider as his parents.
But again, you have insisted on unilateral control as the single Omnipotent ruler of the Moyer family. I have sent similar proposals to this for months,
starting in September. I can re-send if you like. I have asked repeatedly to have you consider a healthier path forward that allows the kids to develop
their own opinions and be able to love us both.
You always say no. Your way is the only way. Period. And here we are. You won't consider what I wanted to share below. That seems nuts to me. So,
as you eliminated every memory from our house so there is no trace of their documented childhood, you also insist on your history only. I also
wonder if you will rewrite who you brought to breakfast with them at Harry's as well...?
-------------------------------- The Thoughts on Adrian I Wanted to Share --------------------------------
Christine-
I realize there is hurt on both sides, but our priority in our conversation should be finding common ground to benefit Adrian's mental and emotional
well-being. I want to stop scoreboarding and focus on establishing a unified front for Adrian’s sake. should reflect on how our actions and conflicts
are affecting Adrian. He's not just an observer; he's in the heart of this, and it's taking a toll on him. He has said repeatedly that he feels like he is in the
middle, which is an accurate statement.
And gifted children like Adrian can be more susceptible to our parental tension, leading to serious issues, like the self-harm he's already expressing.
Instead of focusing on our disputes, let’s concentrate on reinforcing positive parenting. Each of us should build him up, provide stability, and show
him unconditional love. Let's find a way to co-parent cooperatively, even if we need a mediator or a counselor to assist us. We don't have to be friends,
but we do need to be partners in parenting. We owe that to him right now.
- Establishing a Unified Front
Empathy and Acknowledgement- We’ve been through a lot, and our emotions have run high. It’s tough on both of us, and I see in real-time how it’s
affecting Adrian, given his unique emotional needs as a gifted child. We saw it again yesterday at Kari's.
The Impact of Conflict- Our conflict has been brutal on Adrian. He’s shown signs of emotional distress, and I know you’ve noticed changes in him as
well. As his parents, we both want what’s best for him; he needs us to work together right now.
The Need for Consistency and Truth- Gifted children like Adrian need a consistent and stable environment. They're more affected by discrepancies
and uncertainties. Conflicting stories or hidden truths will cause him more significant anxiety and confusion.
Child's Right to Love Both Parents- We both love Adrian, and he has the right to love both of us without feeling guilty or torn. When we use him as a
pawn, we're infringing on this right and putting our needs above his. Let's please stop that.

- Parental Alienation and Its Impacts
Our Role as Parents- Adrian needs to see despite our differences, we both prioritize his well-being. Using him as a messenger or expecting him to take
sides places an unfair emotional burden on him. We need to protect him from our adult conflicts.
Adrian’s Well-being- We’ve both been his pillars in his 12 short years and must continue to be regardless of our acrimony. It hurts me deeply to see
him struggle like this. Parental alienation can be incredibly damaging, and it's taking a toll on him.
Rebuilding Trust- I want to rebuild trust with Adrian, not just for my sake but also for his mental and emotional health. As his father, we both have
to assure him that he is safe with me and doesn’t need to choose you over me or take your side.
Alienation for Gifted Children- Kari, who understands his advanced emotional and intellectual capacities, has expressed concern about our current
dynamic. Adrian's heightened sensitivity can magnify the emotional pain of feeling torn between us.
- Positive Memories and Their Role in Adrian’s Stability
Our Positive History- Adrian's memories of us as a family and our past experiences are his identity. Today he looks around and doesn't see any
representation of memories. You took those from him and he may feel like he's lost part of himself.
Both of Us are Adrian’s Life- Even though we’re separating, for Adrian’s psychological well-being, he needs to know we both love him and that he
hasn’t lost the love of either of us. He needs a sense of continuity and security to feel safe again.
Unified Communication- Let’s decide on how we’ll communicate with Adrian about the divorce and any changes in our household. It's 9 months
overdue so it's crucial we do it calmly and without casting blame to avoid causing him further distress.
Coping Mechanisms—We should consider strategies to help Adrian cope with the changes. Perhaps we can work with Kari to develop a consistent
narrative that helps him understand the situation in an honest but also reassuring way togehter.
- Setting a Path Forward
Long-Term Consequences- The long-term psychological effects of being in the middle can be profound for a child as perceptive as Adrian. If we
continue this way, he might struggle with trust, relationship-building, and self-worth in the future.
Immediate Actions- Until Conner is done, we should work on creating a peaceful environment around Adrian. This means resolving not to fight in
front of him and to ensure he feels supported by both of us during his time with either parent.
Long-term Considerations- We need to find a way to co-parent effectively. This is not just about us but about ensuring Adrian’s giftedness is not
overshadowed by familial turmoil. He deserves to have a fulfilling childhood and reach his potential.
Collaboration with Professionals—I want us to take the advice of the professionals seriously, not cherry-pick. They have Adrian’s best interests at
heart. Let’s collaborate and utilize their expertise to support Adrian through this crazy mess he is in.
Let's both remember the positive role each of us has played in Adrian's life and figure out how we can continue contributing to his development and
happiness by creating a stable and nurturing environment for Adrian moving forward. Thanks in advance for your partnership and thoughtful
consideration...

The other messages were not related to this. Period. We have a ton of outstanding issues that have never been addressed. You won't let me. If we can
do "running list" again it solves that.
Per this, I asked to discuss this with you over the course of two days, multiple times, while it was fresh. You said you're the only one who will make
decisions and "monitor." That was it.
I have presented a detailed plan for us to discuss below, just as I promised I would. I did the research and took the time to help Adrian. He is my son,
and I want the best for him
You can make any excuse you want for not partnering on his mental health. I have done this since September. This is not an outlier. You always reject
what I say out of hand. Always.
Here are just a couple more examples of my attempts to work with you. Both flatly refused by you. You would not even consider what I think is
healthy and supportive support for them.
So, I agree that writing it does not make it true. What makes it true is the digital paper trail of my attempts to work with you to help our kids and then
your documented refusals to do so.
You can pretend you entertained my perspective, just like you pretended to trust Dr Brown or even Kari now. The actual chronology will show
something different. It's all documented.
- June 30th: The best the Moyers ever were as a Family Together
- July 4th: You hid the affair with Kevin by moving off Sbux servers
- July 5th: You asked for a peaceful separation and nesting for us
- July 23rd: You lied about you and Kevin but I showed you proof
- April 16th: Max won't even talk to me, AD is thinking of Self Harm
- April 17th: You're refusing to engage on my thoughts for AD
I can add more details, but instead, I would like to discuss what I have proposed. I assure you I'll be kind and constructive. I hope you reconsider and

We were having a good conversation until I asked you to explain why you canceled the room that I had that youpromised to me. It took more work to
screw me than just to let me have it.
Then you made the point that you don’t do anything negative to me. At which stage I reminded you that you were there for the very fact that you
kept my UA cups for two weeks.
So that has not given us a chance to talk about Adrian for the second week in a row. In fact, you refused to even discuss my kids with me. Even when
there is self harm involved.
I am asking you in a very calm way, and with the stipulation, I will not talk about anything else. At all. No matter how I feel. If we can, please just talk
about Adrian and his visit today.
I don’t wanna play the game that we did last week. I just want to talk about Adrian‘s mental health.  we had a very heavy conversation and I would like
to discuss next steps with you.

I have stepped away from all communications with you whatsoever since last Tuesday. This is because I do not want to play games and I am only
interested in talking about Adrian‘s mental health.
We had a meeting today with Dr. Brown. It was very important and he and I crossed a milestone.  Given the critical time that he is at right now, I am
particularly concerned about him..
I would like to have a conversation with you about his mental health just like I asked last week . We are seeing professionals in the kids best interest.
That is the only thing I am even asking to talk about.
We talked about your money issues and the budget to solve issues that are important to you. Please allow me to have a discussion about my Adrian’s
mental health since that’s important to me.
Please afford me the same courtesy. I want to do this in a civil and respectful way. He my son and I am asking you to respect that. Please let me know
when we can chat. It does not have to be now.

I left Sbux after you started arguing about the time share units and wanting me to fiix things.
You followed me to the car after I told you the conversation was over.
As I sat in the car trying to close the door, You continued arguing about the time share. Then demanded we set some time to speak. I responded no
repeatedly, then clarified I did not feel safe.
As I drove away you followed behind my car yelling at me. I stopped to let a car back up. I heard you pound the back of my car, then yelled I hit you.
This terrified me
I exited the parking lot pulling into met parking lot so I could drive to pick up Adrian. You crossed over to the Met parking lot and again banged on
my car.
Sending the message below, completely ignoring what just transpired is scary and disingenuous. Your words abd and a Fiona do not align.

But I honestly don’t care to discuss why we had the timeshare disagreement and what you said that you were going to do because it’s not that big a
deal to me . The only thing that matters is Adrian’s mental health. And I am asking you sincerely that we have a discussion about it. For the second
week in a row.
May we please talk? I can give you time, space, whatever you like. I am in no way trying to force myself on you or make you feel uncomfortable in

Can you please pick up. We do not have to have the conversation now. It looked like you did for a second and then it disconnected. Please pick up,
even if we just arrange another time to chat when we are both in a better place. I don't need to do it right now.
So I want to assure you that I will respect your feelings and anxiety. But we went the whole week without talking last time, and Kari specifically said
today that Adrain was still considering self-harm. Please let me know if you will work with me to help him.
This is especially important given our conversation, which may have been traumatic for him. I want to let you in on what we learned together and the
next steps. We are both still his parents and since you are keeping him, I need you to know since I was there.

Subject:Adrian... two weeks in a row
Message 2536 of 4024
Christine, I honestly can't believe I am sending this into a black hole for the second week in a row. But I'll also attach last week's to see if anything
resonates with you. This is hard...
------------------------------------------------------------------------ My Plan Subject to Kari's Advice
Building a solid foundation for mending and strengthening my relationship with Adrian is essential. I will stay healthy and move forward one step at a
time. I will maintain my sobriety and be transparent with him when he has questions. This includes safe words, Soberlink, or anything else that gives
him peace of mind. This will take time, but it's the long game I'm playing.
After my discussion with Kari, talking with my sponsor, and doing my research, my proposed focus will be:
•     Apologize. I'm sorry today, but I will keep apologizing for what I have done. I want Adrian to know I mean it and hear what he says.
•     I need to be open and transparent about my recovery so Adrian understands how serious I am about staying sober so that I will be there for
him.
•     When he opens up, I will listen first. I want him to express himself fully before I respond to show him that he is valued and his voice matters to
me.
•     Given that actions speak louder than words and consistency is essential, I will continue to show up, stay sober, and keep a regular routine.
•     I will work with Kari to set clear goals for my time with Adrian. It can be either about doing activities or just heartfelt chats. But we need the
time.

•     Adrian needs to have a say in what we do when we spend time together so he feels respected and in charge. I want him to feel his sense of
control.
•     We've bonded through sports, but I would also like to continue to bond with him intellectually, so I'll suggest activities that challenge him
mentally.
•     I want to demonstrate my agape love for him so he sees that it is unconditional and not dependent on anything Adrain does, says, or achieves.
•     My therapy will be essential to ensure I am strong mentally and physically so I can focus on Adrian rather than what has transpired with us
since July.
•     It will take my time. Rebuilding trust requires that, but I also need the opportunity to do it so we can celebrate small victories and stay the
course.
Naturally, I am all ears if you have any input on this plan for me. That is, after all, why I want to discuss it with you. Having two parents working
together in his best interest is far more beneficial than us operating without communication, checkpoints, goals, or shared strategies for his mental
health. So, please reconsider the position you've taken since Hong Kong.
----------------------------------------------------------------------  My Suggestion to You as a Co-parent
If you really want to help Adrian navigate through everything we have him messed up with, here are my suggested steps that you could take to make
things better genuinely:
•     We need co-parenting therapy. We have to stop making excuses and figure out how to work together for Adrian's sake. This is about him.
•     I hope you'll show empathy and take a moment to understand how much this affects him and act. He feels like he is then in the middle now.
•     I'd like you to encourage Adrian to share his feelings for both of us neutrally so that he doesn't feel like he has to take sides to please one of us.
•     The internet and attorneys are your best resources, said no professional child therapist ever. Please consider taking the advice of professionals.
•     I need you to start supporting his relationship with me. Cutting off contact and requiring supervised visits further villainizes me and fosters
distrust.
•     I want to stop the blame game. He sees this, and it's not healthy. We need to quit being hospital to one another when he is around. That is
devastating.
•     SAAS was a big decision we made together. Let's find other opportunities to show him that we will put him first and make decisions in his
best interest.
•     I would encourage you to do more reading. I appreciate your focus on self-care, but understanding the impact of divorce might help you
better support him.
•     You might consider what we are teaching him about forgiveness. This is an important lesson in Adrian's life, teaching him how to handle hard
situations.
•     I support your therapy, so you are there and healthy for him, and also after some healthy introspection on the messages we send, admitting
mistakes.
Focusing on these steps could make a massive difference in Adrian's life. He needs both of his parents to be at their best and work together, especially
now. It's up to you to consider or not.
I'll continue to do this whether you get on board or not. But it's important to me to continue to try and get you involved for Adrian's sake.

Hey -
Per our in-person chat this evening, I just wanted to confirm we agreed to peaceful, constructive, non-violent communication on OFW till our
comfort permits more. It is only a baby step, but just being respectful and agreeing on something—anything—is better than bangin' our heads on the

Hoping that we can discuss:

"Conversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he communicated to her in an honest and open environment was
incredibly brave and I need to respect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made it clear to me if she believes
he is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That is her obligation."
This email discusses the AD meeting, as per last night. You said you heard Adrian say these things yourself, but you don't say that here. You say that
Kari discussed it with you afterward. Which was it? I agree that Kari would take action if safety were a concern. She has not done that.
"How to structure plans moving forward is now being directly addressed to ensure complete safety. "
Who is addressing this? Is this you solo with the web? Kari explicitly said she will not participate in this, so I'd love to know who is 'structuring your
plan' and what their qualifications are, given the PHD was not qualified. I am sure you would want to share that with their father, right?
I'm sure you can understand why I am trying to understand the truth after finding out last week that you were actually sitting in the same room with
Adrian when he reportedly said things in conflict with Dr Brown's contemporaneous notes conveying Adrian's true feelings.

The worst case we agreed to with Max and Adrian was that they both exercised free will to visit, so what do you tell AD about seeing me and his own
choice? Does he even have that anymore?
It would be helpful to understand your interpretation of encouraging ADs' "free will" right now.

Do you have a preference for day or time?
So, per the free will part, I get you heard him say that one thing in one session with you there. We also know, and it has been noted that both Max and
Adrian say, " Parent, please," if you are there.
 So, my point has always been that they have been progressively turned against me over time.
So, while documenting all of our exchanges, there is a definite change from all last year's texts and even the most recent events. He clearly was at a
place where he called on me, often, to do stuff with him and talk about tough things. All of that has changed since April started.
I think it would be in our best interests to try and figure out why he decided to turn against Dad and start parroting your POV. I know that is not our
intent, but perhaps this is an example of the "law of unintended consequence" you did not see coming. Should we share notes to discuss?
I think we are on the same team, agree?

You might want to consider it as you define the parenting you refuse to discuss with me. Seems pretty important since that happened on your watch.

Everything you send on this topic now says "we" and "us." But it is not us as Max and Adrain's parents. It is you and Annalisa. Every comment is
about what you and Annalisa are doing after my one request, which was that "we" and "us" would be the actual parents of Max and Adrian.
You say I am threatening you by asking to share notes on what has transpired on your watch. They will be shared anyway, but I hoped that you and I,
as "we" and "us," could partner together on the children we brought into this world, not you and an attorney vs. me and an attorney.
Current Proposal:
- Christine and Annalisa
Rejected Proposals:
- Christine and Robert, the Moyer parents
- Yurushka and the Moyers (rejected: regular dinners)
- Debbie and the Moyers (rejected: new traditions)
- Dr Brown and the Moyers (rejected: two parenting plans)
The entire descent into chaos and thoughts of self-harm started with the team you choose when we were in Debbie's office. We agreed that if you
would not let me be involved with the family for the holidays, I would get a place in Bellevue to begin "new traditions."
This was horrible and painful to me, but I did it at a significant cost to our fiscal health because it was what we agreed was best for the kids. Then you
pulled out and attributed it to the plan Annalisa had advised. You said it plain as day to Debbie, and I have plenty of details.
Since it has been Kabuki theatre with you, over and over, we see professionals and get advice, spending Dec-Feb to get Dr Brown's feedback. And with
the brief exception of the end of December, you defer to the plan you and Annalisa have devised instead of recommendations.
I want to ensure you do not consider this a threat. When I see a months-long pattern of rejecting professional advice, refusing to work with me
constructively, and then asking to repeat the way we got here as your only next step, I am not so inclined based on the past.
For that matter, who on earth would be? Do you have a single positive thing to show for your plans? I was doing great with both our kids till July 4th,
and then July 5th. Our history shows that included you too. But under your watch, Max won't see me, and AD is considering suicide.
If I were the father in an awful book you were reading... would you really say, "Hell, yes! For Max and Adrian's sake, you gotta go with what got you
there. It has been amazing and healing advice so far. The Moyer's are doing better than ever with Christine at the helm now?"
Your watch, your plan, your results = another Christine and Annalisa plan?
I don't get this...

As you saw in my communication to SAAS attendance, Max hurt his foot and is resting today per recommendation from the Dr to elevate and ice for
24 hours.
Tuesday, he jumped over a chair at school and landed on it funny. I picked Max and Adrain up from the bus stop after school per regular schedule,
and he informed me what happened, it hurt but was fine. I observed it was slightly swollen, and we elevated and iced and gave him a Motrin. We
discussed an urgent care visit, but decided against it, as it seemed to be ok and he was walking fine but a little tender.
Max went to school the next day (yesterday) as normal. I dropped Adrain and Max directly at school as Adrian was leaving for camp. Max said it was
tender, but declined using a crutch or boot, as he deemed unnecessarily based on pain level at that time. During the day, he called and indicated it was
hurting a little more, and we agreed to have it checked out, out of abundance of caution. I made an 8pm appointment at Seattle Childrens Urgent
Care, as he wanted to attend the after school Tech Theater program. I picked up from his bus stop at 7pm, and we visited Seattle Childrens at 8pm.
Upon examination, they suggested an xray to rule out broken bones, and confirmed it was in fact just bruised. Said to take the day off school today to
rest and elevate, continuing the care we had been doing.
He is in good spirits.
Let me know if any questions.

I see in my email Max had an accident that required emergency medical attention. I want to confirm he is Ok, and does not need anything additional?
Please confirm.
I don't see anything here. I am blocked by you on any other way to communicate because of the incorrect RO that you and Annalisa refuse to update
months after saying it was filed by mistake. Despite Max and I being in the best place we had for years, it appears I am blocked now on Max's phone.
And I get worried because I think we agree that for various personal experiences, I have a pretty deep background on urgent/orthopedic/general care
situations. If you disagree, I'm not arguing.
I remind you emergencies are not planned or scheduled, so we need a way to communicate, but I can't seem to get that to resonate with you.
If AD requires urgent care when he is over next, and I have to rush him to see someone, I assume this is the rule we play by? No call, you will find out
when you find out. Maybe I'll respond.
I was not healthy before. I admit that. I needed help. I had the strength and courage to address that with four years of DBT and EMDR. I got better.

Christine-
I began writing the email before yours landed. I did not choose to ignore it. It was not there. As I started it I paused to make coffee. I assume you have
paused during a draft before?
“Max hurt his foot. Out of abundance Of caution I took him to Seattle children’s urgent care last night. X-rays did not show anything broken but
clearly bruised. Asked he elevate, ice and rest for 24 hours, so stay home and come back in 5 days if no improvement. “
I did not mischaracterize anything. In your original email it lacked any of the details you have since provided. I was going on the very limited info I
have living out of the loop.
I am not going to tell you how to behave, but you seem toxic. You say things and make accusations that are unnecessary and inflammatory. Do you
expect that to help our kids situation?
Please remember who, as parents, we need to focus on. I know who I was once upon a time. I realize you will never forgive me and will always want to

... But it's not for lack of trying. I told you in Kari’s office weeks ago that I had done a lot of soul-searching and had done a lot of reflection on our
conversations and the way things happened. I told you then that I wanted to work with you on a parenting plan that took my past behavior into
account. I told you I am not fighting you. I am not trying to point the finger or put the blame on you. I am accountable for my own actions and
acknowledge them.
And that's why it's so hard to talk to you now as you still can't find a way to hear me. You are my family. I'm trying to own what I did. I'm trying to
get better for god's sake. And that's why I would like to know what the boys are saying. I'm not in a scoreboarding exercise against you. We are their
parents and we're trying to do right by them. All I have is the information that I have from them and therapists. And must make my judgment based
on that.
But now you're saying that you've done some investigation, and I should go talk to Hamlin Robin and SAAS, and that you have secret diaries. You
suggested I go do my own research and talk to these people, too. I can do that, but I would rather work with you to arrive at a common viewpoint or
at least share the same info to make informed decisions in our boy’s best interest. I'm trying to work with you for the sake of the kids.
But you just don't let me agree with you, and you want to keep it all the secret. I have no idea how to get through to you. You seem so dead set on my
destruction that you will not acknowledge or help me be a better father, you just want to win. I don't get that, Christine. it's not winning if they lose. I
want to know all I can about Max and Adrian so I can be a better father to them. I hope we all deserve that. Please consider my thoughts.

Allen is gone. You made no effort to extend my time with Adrian after I asked all week.
This was critical, as noted by his therapist for the reasons below. You also limited any communications to this platform and went dark to do your
thing instead of engaging in the only four hours I have had for the last two weeks to accommodate his mental health.
I noted a big change in his behavior since this began so I wanted to note for you:
- Seems distant, mutters a lot, WAY into video games
- Would rather just sit around than do things we did
- Cusses A LOT now- "God Damn", "What the hell", "SHIT"
I am sure Alan also sees it but is too polite to say, but probably would if he was forced.
I will not make a value judgment on either your decision-making or what is happening progressively on your watch under your legal strategy. That
only inflames things, and I am pretty sure that just like anything else we plan to share, it stands on its own ko..
I am learning a lot about this supervision process. Alan has definitely seen the worst of the worst. I am extremely glad I have him to protect Adrian
and me. I'm not sure, but he must think I am a pedophile or something; he says that even his worst case gets 8/week.
Since you have removed every single memory of our past from the children, I'll share a few that popped up on "this day last year" for me. Perhaps you
can share since you have definitely cultivated an environment devoid of the happiness the Moyer's had as a family.

I hope you will take ten seconds and consider this from something I am reading on navigating co-parenting challenges in an acrimonious divorce. I
hope at some point we share the view that all of our kids should have a healthy relationship with us both.
It’s not a win for you to have them hate me like you do. We did have some amazing time as a family that is being completely scrubbed from their mind
to focus solely on the negative. And at the same time, I have no way to have healthy conversations to heal.
—————————————————————
When a parent will not show forgiveness to the other and openly harbors resentment, it will have significant implications for a child's development
and worldview. Not eliminating one parent from a child's life, despite challenging dynamics, is crucial for several reasons, to all involved, particularly
in teaching healthier emotional and interpersonal skills for all:
1. Teaching Forgiveness and Conflict Resolution: When a child observes one parent refusing to forgive, it models that holding grudges and not
resolving conflicts is acceptable behavior. This will impact how the child handles conflicts in their own relationships throughout life. Demonstrating
forgiveness and conflict resolution, even in difficult situations, teaches children about empathy, understanding, and the complexities of human
relationships.
2. Emotional and Psychological Impact:
Removing a parent from a child's life will lead to emotional distress and issues such as anxiety and depression. When this separation is compounded
by visible resentment by one parent, the child will be taught to associate relationships with perpetual conflict and negativity, which can hinder their
emotional development. It’s critical to remember how you want your child to be as their own adult.
3. Identity and Self-Esteem Issues:
A child's identity is shaped by their understanding of and relationships with their parents. Witnessing ongoing resentment will instill feelings of
insecurity and doubt, potentially leading to issues with self-esteem and self-worth as the child might feel they are somehow at fault or inherently
problematic. While unreasonable, a child will likely blame themselves for not stopping regrettable behavior.
4. Impact on Social Development:
Learning from the behavior of parents is a primary way children develop social skills. If they see that one parent never forgives the other, they will
emulate this inability to forgive in their own social interactions, affecting friendships and other relationships. Conversely, if they see forgiveness and

compassion, they will value these traits.
5. Long-term Relationship Skills:
Children model their future relationships on their interpretations of their parents' interactions. Exposure to unresolved resentment will predispose a
child to struggle with trust and to potentially replicate such dynamics in their own adult relationships. It is critically important to see how parents deal
with past situations even if there might have been conflict. This is true to life and they are learning important values now.
6. Promoting a Balanced Perspective:
Maintaining contact with both parents, when safe and possible, allows the child to receive a more balanced perspective on interpersonal relationships.
It helps them see multiple sides to situations and to understand that even people can have flaws yet still be worthy of love and connection. They learn
not to shut people out and to be compassionate.
7. Legal and Ethical Considerations: Beyond the emotional and psychological rationales, there are legal rights and ethical considerations that support a
child's right to have a relationship with both parents. Cutting off a parent without substantial reasons can contravene these principles and potentially
harm the child in the long run. When a child is cut off from another parent legal remedies should be perused. Unless there is active abuse, this is not
healthy.
It is essential, therefore, to foster an environment where forgiveness and reconciliation are valued, not only for the immediate benefit of the child's
emotional environment but also for their long-term ability to build and sustain healthy relationships.
Professional support from counselors or therapists can be vital in navigating these complex family dynamics, focusing on the child’s best interests,
helping all to move towards a more positive and constructive relationship without ostracizing a parent.
Again, I am asking to have a mental health discussion for our kids, free of judgment or finger pointing. How we got to this place is less material than
recognizing we are here and providing a way for us all to heal in a safe and therapeutic way. Separation is not the way.
I am not having that discussion with the architect of the “holiday freeze” plan that kicked this off in Nov.
Please advise...

Thanks for the great conversation this AM and even more for a commitment to at least discussing an option to break the log jam. I want the same data
and want to be your teammate for the PP>
After yesterday, I had the genius realization that it really does not matter how we got here. What matters is that we don't repeat it again and we
urgently address the here and now.
I hope that whatever happens tomorrow with Kari, we can start tonight and show Adrian the behavior we would like to see in him as he grows to
adulthood. Let's model. See attached.
I hope we can spare a smile for all our sakes... we can do this...
thanks again!

We had great, measured, peaceful conversations this AM. But there's no way to take the win with you. If I make a suggestion, you say you are anxious
and don't want to talk. Everything needs to go through your lawyer. Annalisa may be well intended, but I'm not negotiating my flesh and blood with
her in your place. You are no professional either, but you birthed them.
We were figuring out how to make peace in the Middle East today and be constructive moving forward, but nothing came of it. After spending the
weekend trying to figure out how to get quality time with Adrian to work on the issues we must address ASAP, I extended an olive branch to you.
But you clearly don't see it that way, no matter how I try or what I do. I can't win.
I do realize, however, why, this spring, with me fully acknowledging my disproportionate role in our past and the verbal abuse, along with all my
efforts to start the healing, you still bailed. It does not matter what I do. I can say it was all me. I try to keep trying to reignite the healing we started last
year you snuffed out, but I can't crack the nut with you. No forgiveness, no healing.
We are trying to do the same thing we were doing then. Everyone else has their hand in the pot and gives advice as if they know us. I don't understand
why we can't just start again. We were doing it. Even if the scab is pulled off instead, the graceful, measured healing journey we were on is out the
door. My mindset is the same: this was my fault; it's time to heal; let's do it.
Nothing has changed... but if we need to have me publicly acknowledge that I responded poorly to finding out you decided to bail on something we
all were proud of and seeing results with, at the same time you had the inappropriate relationship you lied about to me, then I agree. On both counts.
You twice broke our vows and rocked my world, but my response is not justified.
The ball is on your court if you want to bail again...

This was tough. Everything said was "I" about you and Max. You have eliminated me as his parent altogether. The only thing I was good for was 1)
accounting for his history (ultimate recount) or 2) how to approach the study skills conversations (which Rachel thought was a great idea).
I can only guess that you recognize this at this stage. You know that before you blew up the Moyers, my participation was the primary contact, and
our relationship was going strong. Even after, well into Nov when your legal parenting strategy went into effect, I was driving things.
I am not sure how you would like me to respond to your situation after I was eliminated from my son's life last year, despite and intense period of
personal improvement and time invested in healing with Max. I still remember sitting in the Kitchen when we all marveled at the progress.
A cynic might think you saw we are getting better together and wanted to stop it. The plan we hatched to heal from deep trauma wounds was going
great. I spent months learning and then growing medicine to help us heal. then you dropped a nuke and now we start over this all over.

We were on the path to healing. I was doing exactly what you asked. It started with the suggestions to consider Ketamine like Mira, then Ayahuasca,
back to the Mushrooms Mira had in her freezer.
We had a plan that would not kill the kids. We were on course. We were doing everything until you and Elsa had a knockdown drag-out; you spoke
with Mom and got serious about you and Kevin. Then BOOM.
Also, please do not say that was "not serious". It was severe enough for you to hide from Sbux servers, keep a secret " KO " folder, flat-out lie to me
about selfies, and then go to HR to say it was innocent.
But to the point, we were healing and executing our plan. I got a break from that horrible life I was leading for us, and we charted a new course. You
blew that up and decided I had to be destroyed instead.
Since then, the kids have changed dramatically. I have documented this along the way. Somehow, your hate and thirst for destruction were
communicable, along with the new language the kids use.
What you've done since July 4th and July 5th had a SeaChange impact on my relationships with all my kids. Now, I'm a villain, not the guy who made
huge changes and had us on track. No, I am unforgivable now.
I'll never get that. It was OK for you to say, "Too little, too late." But rewriting our kids' history and where we were so you can marshal them to
destroy me does not make sense. That was your decision.
What you have done to destroy me using the kids is relevant to co-parenting.
And please quit saying I'm threatening you if I bring up Kevin. That had a huge impact on us and recent history. You even made us all eat with him,
so Dr Brown added a special note to our PP because of you.
But again, I don't think you see anything you have done as counterproductive.

She also said given Max’s age, we cannot require him to attend if he does not choose.

We agree on Max and his attendance not being mandatory,
You can spin this any way you want. I intentionally asked you to be there for the discussion. I am so tired of hearing things are "not really that way"
because you have some secret, covert, shady ass story of how you were really there when it happened, or you really heard it but the witness got it
wrong, or now, that you refused to have the discussion together as I have asked over and over, even again today, that it is not what you heard.
How about this, if you want to engage constructively for our kids, stop all this secret bullshit and nonsense. I'm not used to this crap in my world.
And now ,you even say you have the kids' diaries but would rather use them against me than to help us define a better parenting plan for them both.

- Fighting in front of Max when I arrived at therapy
- Refusing to let me help my son Adrain feel better
- Refusing to meet with Kari, but then meeting her

Agreed.
You have too much going on to co-parent effectively, especially if it is related to me and not luxury vacation theme park planning. What would you

So my other pro tip would be to just answer instead of taking the time to compose an excuse for being unable to answer. It's the same time either way,
and the former saves oodles of follow-ups and time. Example- this email.
We still haven't gotten anywhere, but we have a thread seven entries long, and I am still no closer to resolution than when I sent the first
communication.  You have to be able to recognize that from the business world, right?
So... before sending an insult or excuse, may I kindly suggest you just answer the question?

Hey-
Just wanted to be sure you saw these in the best interest of Adrian. Kari confirmed she will keep the conversation between the adults, it would be great
if you could do the same. Based on the way you handled the holiday feedback, you confronted Adrian to investigate. I am trying to avoid a repeat
where you put him in the middle of our adult situations.
If you would like to discuss the bigger issue with Adrain, I am all ears. I always ask, and you only say you are unwilling, but I hope we can crack the ice
here. This is for Adrian, not us. Based on the limited information I have from long conversations with AD, the knee-jerk mandate to have supervised
visits might have backfired a bit, and he is resentful.
That said, I am not terribly surprised. Neither of us nor our attorneys are trained in children's mental health issues, and there is an alternative agenda
here. Plus, there is a clear pattern of perverting the therapist's feedback into something that satisfies personal narratives by ignoring professional
advice. But I fear we don't have the tools to help Adrian.
This obviously frustrates me. Last year, I admitted what I did, asked for forgiveness, and was given the chance to work with you. We agreed to a plan. I
put my whole life into it, and the results showed we were better than ever. We turned the corner. The Moyers were getting their long overdue reboot
to therapeutically address past damage. Then, BOOM!
Your watch, your plan, your results...  I liked our plan; the kids were healthy, and we were a family. We were destroying our retirement, and no one
was prosecuting a Sherman's March to the Sea retribution campaign. I showed contrition and was leading us down a path of recovery that is well
documented. Was this really a better choice for the children?
- Your watch
- Your plan
- Your results
Did your Mom really convince you hate and revenge were the better way, and it would be healthier for our children to choose this route? Or did you
leave out our spring and summer? Or did you feel Kevin would leave his wife when you two got hot and heavy with selfie/gift swaps, Michelin Star
dates, nude spouse pics at dinner. KO your big secret lie.
I just don't get it if this is about the welfare of Max and Adrian. Nothing is better for them now.

Subject:ADs Feedback - 4/27
Page 702 of 1048


Hi Ladies, Rather than rewriting this, I'm transparently sharing this outtake from my notes on the Saturday visit with AD. I hope we can all learn
from each other and compare notes to figure out what is best for him at this difficult time. You will also see Alan's trip report attached. Draw your
own conclusions; I am just sharing the info. PLEASE DO NOT share this with Adrian, though. I really don't want him to shut down again.     
------------- AD Visit Notes 4-27-2023 -------------  
I had a good time with Adrian on Saturday, but it was not as great as it usually is. Since the months-long separation started, Adrain has been notably
more distant, and his language and positions echo Christine's voice and POV. This is not at all dissimilar to what I saw in Max, which began sooner, in
October of last year (when he began asking me out of nowhere when I would get a job so I would be able to pay child & spouse support. Max never
much cared what our burn rate but he seems to now) Correlation is not causation, but there is a lot of correlation imho. I also shared some pretty big
changes in ADs behavior for Christine.    I noted a big change in his behavior since this began, so I wanted to note for you:
- He has a very negative now, and pushes back on our "lemonade life"
- Would rather "sit around" than do active things we always have done.
- In general, seems distant, mutters a lot, WAY into video games now
- Adrian cusses A LOT now. I hear "God Damn" | "What the hell" | "SHIT" 
But- and this is incredibly important info and something I will share with Kari Betts, AD reached out to me late (11:30 pm) sat night to say he did not
want to hang out. I called him back, and we had a very long discussion. He assures me he is not scared of me, but now he is very mad at me. And
he can not forgive me. I listened and apologized for my poor behavior. I asked what caused this change in his attitude and he said that he just never
had the time to think about it, echoing his mother's vocabulary. He also has no idea of my sober history or the program I am on now that verifies my
sobriety, which is painful since I blow for him all the time. I'm hoping for transparency about these efforts. So it was super important for us to TALK
about the past!
These discussions are critical right now. These are the same ones we all had in the spring before this started and in Jan when we started again, but we
were cut off and could not have meaningful conversations till Kari created a safe space again a couple of weeks ago. And while I like Alan a lot, that is
not a healing atmosphere for us. Adrian actually may resent the arrangement because it feels like a "set-up." We can't have honest conversations about
what's on our minds and important to us. Instead, we force conversation on the mundane while the painful discussions are locked away and ignored.
"Putting on airs" may be salt in the wound.

I get you don't know how that is possible, but it happened.

You also don't understand what happened with Blink cams.
Here is the problem: When you do it to me, it is a simple "not sure it's possible" while it has been clearly happening for months on end. And still is-
right now!' But for Blink, I begged you to let me show you what happened in real-time. But that did not support your narrative or advance your

This is especially important at this stage because you have made it crystal clear you have information that should be considered when we discuss
parenting plans. But you will not share. It's more important to be 'right?" than to inform healthy plans for Max and AD. Unfortunate.

I have shown you what I get. You know that but accuse me of monitoring you. Which you know is completely dishonest. Then you have Annalisa

And why would I take my kids off my Microsoft family plan? Are you the sole parent? How do you expect them to continue with all the Xbox
personas and subscriptions they have invested in for years?  We have eCompany store rights for life, you know that. Why would I kill that?
You really are trying to expunge and eliminate any of their life's history for you to re-write. You took every digital memory and picture frame from the
house. Now you want to cut this link too.
And what are you doing to support their safety?
How are you handling?
- Software Updates
- Parental Controls
- Enable Safe Search
- Content Filters
- Monitor Usage
- Secure the Wi-Fi
- Limit Screen Time
And then for "Drop-ins. I have no devices registered to me on Amazon." You just keep saying it when I see it with my own eyes and I have shared with
you many times that this is simply untrue. Why keep saying that?
If you are shown as calling me, it means you have a device registered to you, and it is calling me. You can say that the Amazon page says you don't till
you are blue in the face. But what I sent shows otherwise. Call their support.
That said, if we just screen capture a page to show nothing is happening, I'll be happy to share any screen captures you like of Blink. I have zero
accounts, and nothing has any history showing otherwise. So stop saying otherwise.
You don't get both ways do you? Or do you not understand what is going on? I am happy to help explain this to you as always, but you seem to feign
ignorance and fallback to message repetition to try and "create your own reality"

2. Using Another Registered Device: She might be using a device registered under a different name or account, such as a shared family device or one
registered under your name.
3. Third-Party Apps: She could be using third-party calling apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or Google Voice, which allow users to make calls using just an
internet connection.
4. Service Errors: There could be an error with the service provider’s webpage that shows registered devices. It might not be updating correctly or
displaying all the information.
5. Number Porting or Call Forwarding: She might have ported her number to another service or could be using call forwarding from a device not
listed as registered.
6. Using a Work or Borrowed Phone: She might be using a work phone or a phone borrowed from someone else that isn’t registered under her
personal account.

But we are seeing new info from AD, and I would like to consider that in case we are making things even worse. I'm talking about my info, even if you
keep yours a secret. But this is super important stuff to deal with sooner than later. So in the interest of our Kids, do we want to talk?
I have not changed since last year when we began this- this is mostly my fault (booze and comms); I am accountable, I apologize again, I have a plan
approved by you to address these issues, I really want to work with you to heal the family. It's the same 2023 commitment.
It was working, we all saw it. So how can we get back to that healthy place, just without you (and I going to Driftwood every week and 'other stuff') ?
I respect you wanted to make your own decision and while unfortunate, you do you. Too little too late. But can we talk Temp PP?

So laser focused on a vendetta of retribution that we would get to this, as your “best effort” for his best interest after we were so close in the Spring.
This is your watch, your plan, your results. Your path of destruction over last year’s progress will have a lasting impact and impart life-long lessons for

I may even hope you never realize what you have done because as a mother, that should be an unbearable weight to have to comprehend.
Revel with your divorce club pals, boast “I Am In Charge” like your post it notes. And gaze out on the damage and destruction you have wrought.
I can only feel sadness for you and for my son, Max on his sweet sixteen. And no father figure. This time last year we were good as gold. Better than

If you can find your way to muster an honest answer, I'd like to know if you have been discussing moving our kids out of state with them yet. You
told them you "would be divorcing Dad" when you were in Hong Kong, so I'd like to figure out how to deal with this one a little more proactively.
Since you asked me to make reservations for him to dine with my family at Harry's last year,  was that the official start of the "Kevin Clock"?  Dr.
Brown intentionally put that six-month note into our PP plan just to deal with you and him cavorting in front of Max and Adrian while we are
married.
Was that his "trial run"? How did the kids do in their audition? Did you guys giggle about the job opening and the poor fool who made the
arrangement for you two? He had no idea that he was training his replacement at the time. Something next level there, Christine. Next level.
By the way, your notes with Dr. Brown clearly discuss me and the kids in Cabo. Your insistence that it was never discussed would be mind-boggling if
not completely normal. I have you noted over and over, saying that it never happened. You lie with such ease, about everything.

You have had a couple of days now.
- You have drop-in devices active now
- These devices have shown to call me
- Amazon says the page sent is bogus
- I asked you to stop this months ago
When I reflect back on your accusations about me, we had a simple solution. We offered an RO that said we would mutually abide by a "no digital
monitoring" agreement. You lost your mind. You went nuts that you would be asked by us to follow that rule not to monitor me.
And then you filed an incorrect RO that said I was a "credible threat" to cause you and the boys physical harm instead. How you made that mental
leap will forever be a mystery, but you never fixed the RO after months of asking, and you preserved your freedom to surveil me.
Please send the list of devices you deregistered since it is still happening. I just don't believe you did anything months later. If you had, it would have
been an easy ask months back when I made the request, as you hounded me.  It all makes sense now, but is still very disapointing.

I look back and can't help but think it would have been better for Max and Adrian to have tried ANYTHING but what you did. Even if you had
concerns, it would have been better than this.
I was trying SO hard... I was SO sober. I was the husband and father you had asked me to be for years - at last.!! But you wouldn't try; even worse, you
made it your life's mission to destroy me.
Have you at least had the courage to be honest with the kids? Do you tell them Dad apologized, he was trying his best, he was trying to help us all, he
was doing everything he could for us?

The bigger issue is have you removed me from your contact list, as someone who has permission to drop in on the devices that are in your possession.
Please confirm this has been done. If not, why not.
It does not matter who the devices are registered to.
Message 2679 of 4024
So it’s my responsibility to block you rather than you taking responsibility for not dropping in?
Why would you say that?  Is that your stance with everything else? You should block me instead?
I’m offering to talk with a human being on the other side so we can both resolve that and quit this

You indicated you were concerned I was dropping in on you, for devices in your possession.
You told me any devices that were registered to me, I would continue to have drop in capabilities, and you asked I deregistered to solve the problem
and stop drop in capabilities.
I asked you to unplug all devices you were concerned about.
I deregistered all devices as requested, to stop this, as you said it would. I sent you a screen shot from the Amazon account and screen shot from
Amazon chat confirming no device registered to me.
I have never intentionally or knowingly dropped in on you.
I was told by Amazon today, the issue is not who the devices are registered to, as you previously told me.
I was told by Amazon today, devices in your possession, will allow any contact that has been granted permission, to drop in. Registration is not the
issue.
Ask:
1) Have you removed me as a contact, that can drop in on the devices, in your possession?
2) If yes, when did you remove me?
3) If no, why not?

Hi Christine-
I hope you’re well. I got a surprise call from Max.. he said that you were telling them about the parenting plan and that I was taking you to court. As
far as I know this is the first time they ever heard about the divorce. He also said you have terrified Adrian and he is scared that he is going to have to
come be with me.
We can talk about that later, and whether that is or is not true, of course it’s not, but I am going to kindly ask that you pause for the night until you
speak to Karri Bettts or somebody else professional. Maybe even reach out to a friend. But what I’m gonna ask, is until you do this, you please leave
the kids out of it.
I am happy to discuss adult business with you at any time, or through our attorneys. But I’m actually going to have to insist that you please not do this
with the children anymore. Please remember that they are not responsible for this and that they actually have no voting rights. We are the adults, this
is adult business.
Thank you in advance.

I am proud of Max as well. Please do not take it out on him if you were unaware. He only had the best intentions and it was the most meaningful
conversation we have had since you did this.
If I have gotten anything wrong that would be great. But for you to say I mischaracterized a conversation that you did not witness after I sent you a
note recounting what just happened is confusing.
I know you do that with every therapist we have, and have an overdeveloped penchant for “saying what I’m saying” ... but you simply were not there
and my recount is accurate and unfortunate.
Either way, somehow they knew the details of the plan, said you shared it, related phases and conditions, told them they should have a vote in this and
begged me to go through with it.
You did something similar with Elsa, but she is an adult. AD is on “self-harm” watch and we were told yesterday about how he is seeking out his
counselor at school now. Please consider our reality.
At some point I hope you will come back to the table and stop deferring all conversations to your attorney. Please reflect on how/where we are since
you began in November and reassess that decision.
Wishing you the best. This is not the woman who was my soulmate for 29 years. Please reconsider...

Unless Annalisa's facts are that Max is lying, I'm not sure how that helps. No matter what, you told them about court and the parenting plan. And
now I assume the divorce (which you have denied since July). Your 'selective' choice of what to share and when they get a vote baffles me.
But thanks for moving the ball forward with open dialog. Again, I want to work with you. And I don't get why you insist on the self-destruction of
your plan. I was doing amazing with the kids, better than ever. Now, after months of isolation and instilling fear, they are afraid of me.
On a positive note, I will share that it did open up the dialog with Max. We talked, and he acknowledged all the things we were doing last Spring—
bikes, camping, rafting, movies, camping, and anime. And it felt like he was fondly reminiscing like he wanted that again.
Let's keep our fingers crossed. I am in no mind to battle with these stakes. And to revisit my suggestion for a while now- I think that the family needs a
therapeutic intervention. Kari can lead, and I will listen. But this is going to leave lasting scars we need to address ASAP.

Can I get a sincere and meaningful update on the kids since the “read in” of the PP details Max noted and the adversarial legal picture you painted for

Adrian was whack, last night. Anytime he is with us is soul crushing to see. I already hear you saying “well, he is great with me.” Which makes my
point for me.
I’ve sent endless emails asking to help AD starting in the summer. Your response of “I’ll monitor” has been devastating. He is a shell of who he used to
be.
I have endless messages saying it is time for you “to put me first” and you were done with anything less. I know “I’m in charge” post it’s say it all. You
are.
Your watch, your plan, your results....
Side note. I get you 1) say you are using OFW but also  2) everything goes through Annalisa. Whatever, your call. Juts fwiw- my milestones don’t

You are not picking up. You never do.
I need to talk about what the kids have been told. Especially with regard to your assertion that “Dad is taking you to court”.
I know what you say Max told Adrian. But I want to known what you have told them as their parent. That is pretty important.
At this point you should just start being honest about the whole thing since July the 4th (not 5th) since it’s all been dishonest.
It is one thing for you to give up, want a divorce, abandon us. It’s another to create a whole new reality and force it on them.
Now they have zero pics and memories even of their childhood. You have expunged me from existence. This will never be ok.
But at a minimum, since you have done this and secretly alienated me, I deserve to know what adult things were said to our kids.
It is urgent because I can’t speak with them and keep them out of it effectively without understanding your story to them. Just like Elsa.
I don’t get the lies tbh. I did enough to be bad on my own. Why would you fabricate so much? Why would you lie to everyone?
Hoping you can find time to co-parent since you do zero during the week. I am formally asking to talk so I can speak with them.
What happens on your watch is inappropriate and scary to me. I would like to discuss asap now we confirmed what you are up to.

We just had our brief conversation. You answered and hung up as always when I asked to discuss the children. Nothing else- the children as detailed in

You said conversations about the mental health of AD have to go through Annalisa after you brought them to tears on Thursday. Is Annalisa around?
AD is. I can't chat with him
If this is the process you are mandating to help with my kid's mental health, who is threatening self-harm in your home on your watch, that simply
will not work for me.
I don't get it, but I don't need to. I need to stop you from destroying the childhood and future of Macx and AD. Chart their course so far, roll it
forward, how does that look ?
Everything that has happened has been your watch, your plan, your results. And as they progress from happy to bad to life-threatening, nothing ever

So.. you have read this. I have tried to call again several time and I have been clear that the subject is only the kids but you refuse to talk, explain, or
even offer a way to discuss our kids health.
I trying to do this today because Thursday was awful, Friday AD was in horrible shape. And I see him on Sunday. Today is the only day to chat.
Given the downward spiral under your roof, it’s a legitimate ask, especially when they are calling me with crying going on, and the fear of God after
you terrorized them with awful visions of me.
The notion you would demand sole decision power based on 1) your recent judgment and 2) you refuse to chat makes that idea utter nonsense.
At this point I will let you know this feels incredibly unsafe to me. You do not seem stable, and it appears you will do anything to keep the status quo.
Given that, and what I have seen you are capable of, I interpret your response to be a dare for me to take legal action against you to try to stop this.
If there is a more peaceful or constructive way to have a mature discussion, I’m all ears and asking. But at this point you seem dead set on a legal battle.

You had a “wheels up, rings off” policy, infamously like airline pilots. You know that bothered AD. I told you often. It’s part of the larger narrative
that includes you screaming “I’m going to be unfaithful to you” out of the blue for Max’s benefit and making the kids eat with KO. You used verbal
threats of infidelity and did things I felt were harmful to our children as a way of manipulating me, but much worse, them.
Documenting behavior harmful to the kids feels like a reasonable exercise. You went into great detail about how you felt compelled to tell me about
Mark or Mark because he was a guy you mentored and so incredibly hot. There was something about men who worked for you directly or indirectly
that you seemed to have a pattern with. That is what I’m sussing out. The spelling of his name is irrelevant. Forget I asked.

May we connect on what "you" told him about me during the episode that terrified him and made him cry? Not what Max may have said to him. I am
tired of being in the dark about how you portray me to the kids. It's not fair to anyone.
Let's be adults, discuss the situation, and figure out how to keep him from our adult situations. I think it is acutely beneficial, given the conversation I
shared with you in confidence and the fact that he wasn't able to even see Kari to discuss it.
Can we please do that before we all see each other today? This is for Adrian.
thank you

Thank you for confirming 
- You will not use OFW to communicate about the health and well-being of Adrain
- "No means no" when it comes to the mental health of a child you are terrifying
This behavior is unhealthy and not something I can't stand by and permit without doing my level best to mitigate it. You insisted on villainizing me to
the point where our kids were calling me directly and begging me not to do the things you said I had planned this week. Sit back and think about that
for a moment- You tell them terrible things about me, they are so scared that Max, who has not called me to chat for six months, felt the urgency to
plead your case because the two of them were so scared of what you were saying to them. 
It is astounding you do not see anything wrong with that. I realize I am the only one who does any reading on parenting, especially when it comes to
divorce, gifted, and special needs kids, but some of this is just common sense. You don't need "book learning" to tell you you should never bring kids
during a divorce into our adult situations or use and influence them. It is in every single PP we have ever looked at. This, coming full circle, may be the
exact reason you always say no to professional guidance. The kids are your pawns. 
What is it with you and this kamikaze death mission you are on for you and the kids? We were better than we had ever been in June. Since you have
our kids on suicide watch. Go be with Kevin; it's honestly fine by me. The kids know him; he knows them. I don't care to make a bigger deal out of it
now that there is water under the bridge. You two can have time with Max and Adrian during your turn. But stop destroying their history and
projecting your unhealthy behavior on them. Your watch, your plan, your results. Right?  
"I am in control" - Christine Moyer, post it notes all over the house.
P.S. I highly recommend "Recovery―The Sacred Art: The Twelve Steps as Spiritual Practice" by Rabbi Rami Shapiro. In a nutshell, it teaches
general principles about your "control philosophy" that can be applied to custody disputes; the advice is to recognize trying to control all outcomes, a
co-parent, or even the children's feelings and choices can lead to more tension and less genuine cooperation.

Embracing principles like acceptance and understanding and focusing on what we can genuinely influence, like providing a stable and loving
environment for the children, leads to healthier dynamics than an omnipotent "I am in control." approach by one parent. In a more collaborative and
less adversarial environment where one parent is not laser-focused on the destruction of the other, by any means possible, children can be
themselves, make their own decisions, and be generally happier, free from the pressure to conform to an alternate reality that denies where they were
last year.
I don't understand why I have to explain that to you or why your actions last Thursday (or since KO came to light for that matter) are so destructive.
This is brain-dead simple stuff.  Don't use kids as pawns. Don't bring Max and Adrian into our divorce as voting participants in our adult situations.
For Christ's sake, please just ask Kevin. From what I know, he would even agree.

When? Now? I have asked you to lead any conversation we have. I also asked to have a professional lead the conversation. I am asking you to describe
what a safe conversation looks like. I am making it clear, I will have a safe conversation with you under your ground rules. I want you to feel safe first!
By contrast, you said the kids have voting right in our divorce. You asked me to get their votes tonight. You told them I am taking you to court and I
would take Adrian away. Max even called me. Our children should not be involved in our adult conversations. I know you really believe they should,
but you’re wrong.
If they had voting rights, we should’ve given them the vote after they had to eat with Kevin. We were doing our absolute best ever and all our history
will reflect that. Did they get to vote on whether you should have an inappropriate relationship with a coworker? We know AD hated “wheels up,
rings off” is that a vote?
I am asking again after four disastrous days in a row, please let me know what will accommodate a safe space and your feelings so we can discuss the
kids. I’ll struggle to accept they should make the call for us given the manipulation going on. If you disagree and insist, we need to have a safe
conversation about it.
I’m all ears, but I am not prepared to put our divorce in the hands of our kids. It’s just not fair for an adult to put that weight on any child. Please
understand that.

We can do this if we try. 
Message 2728 of 4024
I’d like to take our truce up a level. I see and speak with people who have gotten divorced now. A lot of them have wonderful, healthy, satisfying and
even rewarding relationships with their ex, and the kids love seeing that. It’s healthy for them.
You and I will forever be the “unit” of family in Max and Adrian’s minds. They will always affectionately look to us as Mom and Dad. We had some
bad times but it will never erase the joy we shared together as a family as well. We can’t flush that.
I’d like to reconsider our relationship and approach all up. Like a fresh start. If we want revenge, let’s do it later in life when the kids are older. Right
now we all have too much living to do. We should not waste another day like this. Let’s fix us.
You and I moved mountains as a team. We came from the trash can and a one bedroom apartment. We have made miracles happen together. Can we
see if we have one final act between us? Can we put our own differences aside and try?
The sky is the limit when you believe anything is possible. Let’s consider what could be rather than what was. Let’s look to a brighter future together,
that creates an example, not just for Max and AD, but for the whole world to see.
Pressure and intensity turns coal into brilliant diamonds. I think we are ready to start cutting the stone and let a new light shine on the world. Let’s be
the couple that separated but everyone admires for their teamwork and bravery.
It means we have to be selfless. It means we have to put others ahead of our own agenda. But ... if Max and Adrian grow up seeing what we did as an
example, one that shows anything is possible, what incredible young men they would be.

We can have the discussion but I’m not optimistic about anything that fosters the current trajectory. Please look at the past six months, note that Dr
Brown recommended unsupervised visits three months ago, and after disregarding her professional recommendations we have no plans to end a visit
in a modality he has actively expressed distaste for and things have only gotten MUCH worse.
And if the plan is to go with the lady we did not select back in November, I’m even more confused.

We can't keep talking separately with her and then using it against each other. It's not helpful.

The most important thing however is that we move ahead with therapy we already have instead of waiting weeks for something new.
The other thing is that we are in the same room if a discussion is happening that involves PP definitions. Otherwise we interpret what we want to
hear.
Summary:
- It would be best if you and i talk rather than this
- OFW coms tend to redirect from the real issues
- We should take advantage of the offer from Kari
- It’s best to have us in the same room with Kari
- I am continuing to be peaceful and respectful

I realize some of these look wonky. For example, on the 5th it was in my bedroom and I spaced it. Then I started in the afternoon. But it shows me
taking the tests over and over.
This was because I ate some keto ice cream. Usually it’s fruit that triggers a positive but after doing some research some foods have sugar alcohol
instead of regular sugar, so it pops.
And then it makes you take it over and over till it doesn’t see even the smallest (four decimals) trace detected. And you have to do it at a weird random
moment after the last.
Then like last night, if I forgot till the afternoon, I take one or two even after midnight so you see I’m not stalling till the next day. You just don’t see I
did that in the daily report.
It’s also very flaky. And sometimes just does not connect. See attached. So then there is that...
Anyway, if you ever have any questions, just please let me know and I’m happy to explain. This is one area that we will never fight over and I’m happy
to accommodate.

FWIW- the reason I had reached out was to discuss Max before Dr Kwon, since I managed everything ADHD along with the medications and doses,
from Adderall, to Ritalin, to Vyvanse. But I never see him now.
I’ve was sitting in the parking lot for 15 minutes but am back in the car. The appointment I have sent from either you or the scheduler, never updated
my version.
There should be a better way. I always synced with in advance of these kinds of things. It would be wonderful and effective if you could kindly return
the favor.

We just had a call. During that call, I asked you why you were going to be pushing out everything including Connor, which I just got the note saying
that was gonna happen but you refuse to answer. All you would say is you’re badgering me about my attorney.
Even after I told you several times I am talking about the dates. You can have any attorney you want. Just because you put words in my mouth and say
what I am saying, (something we can search our artifacts and see over and over) does not mean it’s true.
That said I told you I absolutely want to speak about the kids. I don’t feel like I have to plead my case to have a discussion about my children and hope
that you grant me an audience. That’s not how this works.
- Specifically for Adrian I would like to discuss Kari’s  recommendations, I don’t think having a parent come in a week later is ever going to work.
These discussions are too ad hoc for that to be affective.
- Specifically for Max I would like to discuss my upcoming box office duty at sass. I thought I would see him today so I could talk to him about it, but
that did not happen. So I would like to discuss that.
- Specifically for both of them, I would like to discuss reunification. Given that our representation met with Jennifer, I want to make sure we are
aligned on its value and that we are going to do that for the kids.

I just had an interesting meeting with a therapist. They have been around for a while and said that if you go with Natalie, you are pushing all your
chips in and going with DV strategy. That is what she does and what she is generally known for. She is a domestic violence domain expert. I assume
someone in your "Joy Luck Divorce Club" (Mira, Tomoko, Heather, Chistina, Joyce, who else?) advised you that it was not a lucky Google search. 
This should not surprise me at all; you have been threatening that for months. Even in our parenting plan review, you made it super clear you did not
want to do it, but would have no hesitation if I did not accept your plan lock, stock, and barrel. I even remember you would not share the doc where
it was written, but you highlighted it on the screen multiple times during the Teams call, telling me you were hopeful I would acquiesce so you did
not have to do this.
But now, you are exclusively focused on proving I am a domestic abuser, destroying me and my life, and rewriting our kid's history. I wonder when
and why you became so vengeful. We created so much positive together. We were a fantastic team. We had it all, and I was the man you wanted me to
be down to your misogynist Instagram guy when we screwed. I did everything for you- kid duty, healthy lunches, beach readiness, Sunfday AMs, date
night.... etc. 
And you blew it all up for you. You were in zero danger and knew that. We were doing AMAZING, and you thanked me early and often for the
change you had seen, noting how great everything was; you could have just participated in the therapy I was begging for. Or just said, "Too much scar
tissue, let's have a civil divorce. But that was not enough. You HAD TO BLOW UP our family and finances. 25 years flushed violently down the
tubes. You had other options.

I'll also note this is really two fathers in a row, you and the Kwans have done this, to. You shut Leo out of his child life so utterly and completely that
he could never have any relationship with Elsa. He never did anything wrong to her. He was sixteen, for God's sake. But that good aloe Kwan gene has
to have it all. No biological fathers are allowed. That is two biological fathers in a row now. That is 100% of the baby daddies you have had. 
It's super weird that we were intimate 3-4 times a day and madly in love until you went to Hong Kong, chatted with Mom, and covered up Kevin, but
we still kept up the booty calls for a long while. We even had our catchphrase, "This does not mean anything." And now I see you taking every single
memory from the children's past, therapist and lawyer hop like it hopscotch, and made it your sole purpose to destroy. Collateral damage be
dammed. 
Side note- I asked about you sitting beside AD when he was talking to the Therapists. She teaches an ethics class and said that was 101. She even asked
if this therapist had ever worked with kids before. She was horrified.

Well, it’s been 6 hours now since I asked to chat with you about our children’s mental health and if we were going to be pushing out any of the
activities that have a high impact on that out further again.
Obviously, your MO in every opportunity is to push things out. Things that would shine a light onto what is happening so someone can decide if it is
right or wrong. But you won’t let that happen.
Additionally, it’s been two hours since you said you would call me back, even after you made plans and had a social hour. I respected that and asked
for a call afterward to discuss the kids together.
Christina is gone, and even though you’ve picked up Max in your home, you won’t call. And you won’t call because talking about what’s best for
Max and Adrian is simply not that important to you.
If it were, you’d make an effort. You don’t. You never do. On your watch, executing your plan, seeing your results, we have a child on self-harm watch
after being the happiest kid I’d ever seen.
Here’s the funny thing though. This really bums me out because it’s our children and they’re going through adult crap that will impact them for the
rest of their lives but none of this had to happen.
You forced this on all of us. It was your decision to blow us up rather than find a peaceful resolution that could preserve our sanity and our future
retirement. That’s all gone now, thanks to you.
I was safe, sane, and sober, and you absolutely knew as we made love regularly, more than regularly; it was crazy how often. And you were under no
threat or danger whatsoever. And knew that.
But here’s the kicker, Christine. That is just who you really are. That is the way our marriage was as well. You tuned out to attend to only yourself
with “I am in charge” post its all over the house for us.
You didn’t give any more of a **** to our marriage than you do now to our kid’s mental health. And that’s why you won’t call even after you said you
would. You’ve never given a ****. You do you.

It’s okay I found out what a horrible, self-centered, dishonest, selfish human being you are. But my ask is the kids do not because I will hold that secret

Hey Christine and Rob,
I wanted to write with a quick update on Adrian's work in English today. The kids had independent work time to finish and turn in late work. Emily
checked in with Adrien to ask him about his past annotations, hoping he'd brought his book to school now that we found it. Adrian told Emily that
he did not bring his book to school, which is surprising. Emily came to me asking for more context since she knows we've been working together to
find his book and help him track assignments.
I am wondering if you can provide some insight. We aren't sure if Adrian does not have the past assignments and does not want to tell Emily or if
there is something else going on.
I included Emily on this email so we could all collaborate together.
Thank you so much for working with us to better support Adrian.
All the best,

I realize nothing makes you change your mind or your perspective, but it's my duty as his father to at least give it a shot. Can't give up on my family as
I watched the destruction you cause. Just sit back and think about this for a moment. Adrian was with us at the beach all the time. He saw what we
were. He knew every weekend was date night, he knew we could not keep our hands off each other, and he knew I loved to cook and prepare the
house for you. He knew I would wake Harry early so you could sleep in. He knew that we were, as a family, the best we'd ever been.
And then you blew us up because you had a personal vendetta reignited by your mother because I got drunk five years ago. And you used it as a
justification to destroy our life. Like you've always said this will be harder on you because I've been thinking about it for a while. And oh my god, was
it ever, Jesus, you are so dishonest. But I can replace you, and in my mind, I have. Adrian, the guy we called Mini me, can't find a replacement dad no
matter how hard you think you can do that. I delivered that boy. He will never get another father. You think this is hard on me. Think about that
poor kid.
In the very best-case scenario, Adrian has been taught nothing in his life is dependable. Down to his father and mother. The absolute pillars of his life.
I am so ashamed of what has transpired. I am so ashamed of what you have done to this family. There were any number of ways we could have done
this without causing lifelong damage to these two children. But you had to prove that your post-it notes were true. You've never been through a
divorce. Ive been through several- at this age. You have no idea of the asting damage you have done. And you still won't even recognize it.
These kids didn't do this Christine. They don't deserve it. Just as you sat them down, shared the parenting plan, and asked them to vote on our
divorce, you pulled them into adult situations beyond their years. So eager to have someone on your side you mentally destroyed our kids to get their
votes. Guess what, Christine? Kids don't get a vote. They have a voice, not a vote, and what you have done since you covered up your affair and took
it out on this family is unforgivable. I'm just wondering at what point in Adrian's life will he stop considering suicide now. Who/what can he ever
trust again. 
The fact that I've got this running mail going back to summer screaming they need help and you've done nothing but disregard every professional
therapist that we have seen, along with their advice, in six parenting plans is absolutely maddening. In what world would someone say "yeah....
Christine's probably got it right, forget the professionals did some Internet research and worked with her attorney." Stop. Please Stop.  I still struggle
to think that you believe this was the best course of action July 5th, but is impossible to believe you think it is still the best course of action today.
Your watch, your plan, your results.... 
I'd like to know when we can discuss the kids, Christine. Is this the 12th time I have asked in the last two days, both before and after a call to action
from Adrian's school. If you think he is "thriving" as you wished, humor me. I want to chat about our kids. 
<<A sampling of my 911 pleas since you and Kevin>>
Please see the attached visitation report from Saturday for your consideration. We had a blast and always picked up right where we left off. The only
downside was that Adrian really wanted to stay longer and continue our father/son game competition. We were hot and heavy into our usual
Connect Four faceoff. I'll note AD is not the same kid when Christine is present. He shuts down. He goes silent and exhibits a very stoic demeanor.
IMHO- he realizes he is a pawn and tries to minimize his role by going "grey rock". He does not understand how we went from our "Dune II"
overnight to this format. It does not make sense. As I understand, this is all because Christine says AD does not feel safe with me based on Kari's
feedback. This might be true, and I am all ears. That said, with a full view of the facts back in February, Dr. Brown recommended an immediate
phased-in plan to preserve Adrian's bonds with me. Something changed.
- Source: Fwd: Moyer Supervised Visitation Report, 04-13-24
Christine- I realize there is hurt on both sides, but our priority in our conversation should be finding common ground to benefit Adrian's mental and
emotional well-being. I want to stop scoreboarding and focus on establishing a unified front for Adrian’s sake. should reflect on how our actions and
conflicts are affecting Adrian. He's not just an observer; he's in the heart of this, and it's taking a toll on him. He has said repeatedly that he feels like he
is in the middle, which is an accurate statement. And gifted children like Adrian can be more susceptible to our parental tension, leading to serious
issues, like the self-harm he's already expressing. Instead of focusing on our disputes, let’s concentrate on reinforcing positive parenting. Each of us
should build him up, provide stability, and show him unconditional love. Let's find a way to co-parent cooperatively, even if we need a mediator or a

out "no" to 4 more supervised every two weeks when I asked.  So this is the 911 call AD deserves right now. He needs to see we are listening to him,
and we want to move on to SAAS ASAP and he has a say. Most importantly, no matter what is going on with us, he will always come first in our life.
When he needs us, we will drop anything: appointments, schedules, our problems, for him. We put our differences aside and find one voice between
us, as it should be when he needs us most.

I have no idea how you came to the unilateral decision that I have no rights as our kids parents. Zero. But I know the courts have not said that so I can’
t understand why you think you are the sole parent now.
Please reconsider. I’m as much our kids parent now, as the night we made them. You don’t get to decide that I’m not one day. Today or ever, Oh
whether you can accept that or not.

I don’t wanna go after you. And this is not healthy for our kids. And to be frank, we did some wonderful things in our life, and had some grand
accomplishments including those two beautiful young men.
I don’t want you to look back on is like we hated each other, we honestly didn’t. We snuggled toes like lovers forever. I’m not asking to be friends
again, but for the love of God, I’m asking us for us to be nice to each other again.
And I’m not saying it just for the kids sick. I wanna do it for our sanity too. There is no school of thought whatsoever that says to harbor resentment
and hate someone for the rest of your life especially someone you were so close to.
I’ve begged you for months. And it’s just gotten worse. Can we please have a self-imposed intervention. The kids would love it if we could get along
and so would I .

It’s unfortunate that after ten months, some of which we were still being intimate, that you can’t sit quietly beside me in the dark for the kids tells me
two things:
- you are incapable of making decisions that are in the kids best interest.
- you probably should consider another therapist. You get worse by the week.
I don’t say these things lightly, and they are by no means meant as an insult. I am just giving you honest advice on what I see. Just like I did with
Annalisa.
I hope you get the help you need. No school of thought fosters hate and destruction outside of terrorist organizations. And I’m sure that’s not you.

I realize you don’t bother checking OFW but thought I’d do the courteous thing and remind you that 520 is closed and parking at SAAS is limited for

If you have a better way to keep in touch let me know. I think I say that about 3-4 times a week and it never really resonates. You seem pretty dead set
on parenting alone.
It feels like either narcissistic behavior or just mental illness when you know for a fact that two parents working together in support of their kids is
better, and yet you balk.
I don’t know what your Mom said in Hong Kong or Kevin told you to do so you could start your new life, but the “main character” syndrome is

request a delay.
As a sidenote, I am hopeful that you are on board with the reunification therapy. We started parenting plans in September so I am hopeful that we
can start reunification therapy ASAP. I lost all of fall, winter, spring, so far. It would be a crime to also lose summer without a professional, finally

law that gave you the power to do this while we share equal custody of our kids and both own the house? Or are you just doing it because you want
to, and you have figured out how to manipulate the system and avoid and stall any sort of court decisions.
You literally took my kids and my house, with no court order or legal right. Are we mutually abandoning the proper rules of family law? How on
earth did you get to be the one that does not abide by anything. At all.

Since you waited to sign her agreement till today and still have not paid the retainer in full, and your history with both professional advice and/or
procedural due dates, can we agree to get the intake form back to Jennifer this week so we can get started?
If you need me to send this ask to Lisa, to send to Natalie, to send to you to respond to Natalie then back to Lisa, then back to me, please let me know
sooner than later. I regret the kids bear the brunt of our inability to communicate, but your incorrect RO is still filed.

Why is getting you to answer basic, simple, straightforward questions so incredibly difficult?
"mind sending me the bills? You are at 30k after I moved all that money to BOFA."- no answer
"you are saying he wants to kill himself because of me?" - no answer.
"how is this happening, with the Study Skills class we pay so much extra for?" - no answer
"Everyone says “moving up” I think this is saying moving out. Is that correct?" - no answer

answer. It is like me asking you what your name is, and you respond with your zodiac sign.
Can I suggest that we save time and energy by asking that you read the question, just pause, read the question again, pause again, write your answer,
read the question again, and see if it matches the question you are asked?
All four are just in the 2.5 days we have communicated this week. If you are going to limit us to this platform, please don't play games. I want to work
with you, please. but I see this obstruction as intentional. Can you please show some effort?
Can we work together?
Also, please answer the original question I posed about the 37k instead of using this reminder that you never answered my questions as a reason not to
answer again. I hope you can reflect on the list and understand my frustration.

This is you. You have an Amex Platinum and Amex Delta.
Amex you: 14, 300
Amex you: 12,700
I am uncertain your spend on the MSFT Fidelity account.
This is me
Alaska: 16,200
Amex me: 14,500
In there were items such as boys camp fees (2.4k) and Seahawks tickets (1.7k), Max driving school (700)
Chase was a mix for 5.5K. I can ask for a breakdown of what was your spend versus mine. When I took a quick look:
Chase: Balance was 5,500 before we split it up. Mixed spend. When I took a quick look I saw Sonos, Roman Health, Ebay, Paypay, ccbill, applypay,
walgreens, linkedin. I only use the card for Amazon, so it includes both our Amazon purchases.
Chase: 6,200 - So I added 700 since we split up for Amazon

Are you pulling back this single way of communication and saying you will have zero communication about the kids or our community property at
this point?
It seems you refuse to communicate at all unless you are telling me to send money for community property spending that you keep secret from me. Is
that right?
Is this a safety issue, or are you just hiding stuff from me ? Just trying to respectfully understand how to work with you constructively on shared issues
we need to address.
Is there no answer?
Message 2852 of 4024
Christine,
I am reaching out because I am deeply concerned that we have not been able to effectively communicate and cooperate in making important decisions
about our children's education, health, and overall well-being. Open and transparent co-parenting is essential for providing Max and Adrian with the
stable, nurturing environment they need.
I respect your role as their mother and hope we can find a way to work together in a spirit of mutual respect, keeping their best interests at heart. I'm
committed to being a collaborative co-parent and am open to mediation or counseling to help improve our ability to jointly care for our sons during
this challenging time.
My goal is for us to make parenting decisions together, with input from professionals like educators and healthcare providers when needed. The kids
deserve to have both parents fully engaged and informed about their lives.
I also wanted to address a concern I have about our communication. I worry that our current platform may not be serving its intended purpose of
fostering open and constructive dialogue. It's crucial that we maintain a safe space to discuss matters related to our children without fear of our words
being misconstrued or weaponized against either of us.
Given the recent history, involving third parties in our communication complicates matters further. So I hope we can find a way to communicate
directly, focusing on our shared goal of co-parenting effectively. If you feel that the current platform is not meeting our needs, I am open to exploring
alternative methods that allow us to communicate transparently and collaboratively.
I understand that communication has been difficult, but I genuinely believe that we can find a path forward by focusing on our shared love for Max
and Adrian. I'm committed to creating a safe and constructive space to discuss these matters.
I believe if we can approach this as a team, with empathy and a commitment to healthy dialogue, we can improve our co-parenting relationship. I'm
hoping you'll be willing to work with me on this directly. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. I'm here and ready to work on positive
solutions for our family.

Subject:Who is at hoops with Adrian ?
Message 2855 of 4024
Ok... it’s been three days since you logged in. I’m the only one here watching AD. I ask you who is here with him because something is off. No reply.
When his ride does come in (you) he is an emotional wreck and wants out of the game. And now as we leave you hurry me away saying “I got him” .
Well you didn’t. And that’s why I asked who was there with him.
As I sit here watching you sort through his breakdown as if he magically got some flu since yesterday, that you just confirmed you had not seen till
then I’m going to ask we coordinate better. I realize your side is super concerned and eager to give advice on his best interest, so perhaps we start by
having the discussion I’ve asked about for months.
Please let me know when we can talk about Adrian. I trust that you have his best interest at heart, but I also realize you actually have no training and
for all these many years I’m the one who has coached him, taken him to every team event, been with him for the peptalk before, and the postmortem
after, so you may be a little out of your depth., no offense.
I know you want the best for him, so I hope you’ll have an open mind and perhaps consider the opinion of someone who’s been so close to him for all
these years, especially in moments like this when it looks like it’s actually much more emotional problem than a flu bug. I’m not trying to point fingers
or place blame, but I think we’re regressing and he’s bearing the brunt.

What I witnessed was more of a breakdown imho. You can have your opinion, I can have mine. But I would like to discuss it with you rather than put
up more reasons not to put Adrian first. You may be well intentioned, but so am I, and I have the experience.
I have been doing this with him his whole life. I put more ice packs/band aids on, wiped more tears off, asked him to take deep breaths and steady
himself, done more concussion tests, and carried him off the field/court more times  than you can ever imagine.
I’m fairly observant after being his coach, father, and mentor on a Sports field of most any kind (or bike trail) and I don’t remember him crying
because his nose was stuffy. You have seem me do this for years. I’m asking to have a conversation about Adrian again.
Whatever you think of me, you know this is true.

I am trying so hard to be nice.
Of course, I feel like I’ve been wronged. But I don’t want the boys to ever see their Dad look at their Mother and see anything but unconditional love.
Not “married love,” but the kind of love a man owes the woman who fought so hard for him and his family.
The kind that shows them they come from the look in their father’s eye as he holds his gaze on her with deliberation and intent, remembering kinder
times when she was his biggest champion, standing not just by his side, but helping him up when he stumbled.
The kind of love that transcends and empowers them because it is in their control to choose who you love and how you love them. And no one can
take that from them. I want them to be deliberate in their life and love who they choose. That is the world they will be creating for themselves in the
end.

It all hit me clear as day when a girl asked when I’d get your name removed. In that moment I had a clarity I had not felt since this all began.
Instead of making a dumb joke or quipping “as soon as possible”, the only correct answer, the only answer that represents the kind of men I want Max

And the lawyers are not going to help get to the bottom of it before August. So let’s at least talk.

Page 771 of 1048


In a nutshell...Kari says to wait for a parenting plan for the family discussion. I have a list of seven of those documented now. And the GAL has no
date in sight.
She is wrong. She is trying to avoid a honest and true discussion. And going into our second summer, waiting on plan number eight is irresponsible.
Happy to share the book. But it’s incredibly enlightening about all the damage we’re doing. And also the way that kid therapist can screw up families.
Her recommendation in the face of our very real and documented history and subsequent results is so tone deaf it’s disappointing. Always a reason to
delay.
I learned this book is a standard in the field, held out as a teaching too and it speaks to our situation with more accuracy than if we had written it
ourselves.
We should act with more urgency. Kids don’t always have the resilience she describes. It’s actually a horrible and devastating reality to understand.
Hope you are having a great holiday with the boys.
Looking forward to our chat!

M&R’s 30th Anniversary congrats attached.
I regret that this all blew up, and that Max and Adrian will never have the benefit of parents that were honest with each other so we could have
achieved the same.
Marriage takes two. I hope I did what I could given the info I had. But bad data leads to bad decisions. And Max and AD will never be the same as a
result.
As we kick off reunification therapy I’m hopeful we can take inventory of the impact of misleading one another. Maybe stop the bleeding from this
stuff.
Anyway just sharing as fyi if you want to send a note.

Start with coparenting there. If you fail, your kids will need their own therapist. Got that. If you still can’t get it together, reunification is up. Got that

I do not see any response to our discussion, and I have zero way to communicate now. Nothing.
I don't want to argue about whether you said I would have to go to court to communicate. If you say you did not, fine. I don't want to anyway. But -
I need a way to communicate with you if you are asserting 100% control of our kids. Absent due process, I have a legitimate reason to want to know
about Max and Adrian's wellfare.
No matter what happens in reunification, with the GAL, or in the Mediation process, no one will frown on us trying to work peacefully and
constructively together in the Kid's best interest. That is what they hope to see. Everything I have read and heard so far regards that favorably. So I am
asking you to propose how we do that.

I just spent the evening documenting. We both have a lot of narratives that we might choose to tear each other down, but I think you will be pretty
surprised by what our texts say day by day.
Example: You may feel you have a pretty good case for gatekeeping and parental alienation, but it was not for safety. You confirmed it is just a legal
strategy from your 3rd lawyer in Oct.
We have both repeated so many things so many times we believe them. However, the actual texts do not support many of those narratives. They are
contradicted by our own words.
My meta point is that neither the GAL or Mediator can make a legal judgment of guilt. They only make recommendations. So I'm not sure what the
end game is for tearing each other down.
I'd like to have a peaceful discussion about working together and arresting the long-term damage we are doing to the kids for what is, at best, a costly,
near-term, destructive, and selfish victory.
Let's get our heads together now, not later, to stop the senseless damage we are doing to our children. The people we work with next will want to see
that and appreciate our efforts if we do.
We spun out of control way too fast. It's too bad, but we don't need to make this worse.

I want to be transparent about my attempt here. I feel like we’ve outsourced our entire family to an industry. We’ve gone through more therapist,
parenting, plans, and lawyers than we have fingers and toes. You and I are worse than we’ve ever been. and we have seen the impact on the kids and
their relationships with me.
This is absolutely the opposite of what we had had envisioned when we started this. I’m not bugging you to chat today. But I am trying to plant the
seed to perhaps over the weekend have the discussion. You know I read voraciously. And lately a lot of my focus has been on the impact of the
“divorce business” on real families with real challenges. It’s not good.
You may disagree and think all this has been positive, and that’s your prerogative, but after we chat, perhaps you talk to your divorce crew and get
their honest perspective. I’m guessing, but I doubt there will be a lot of positive feedback on the “business of divorce” and many of the people paying
for private schools working in it. It’s a meme for a reason. It’s a real thing.
Want to take a timeout, step up to the balcony for a moment and assess what’s happening on the dance floor? It can’t hurt us to have the

You misunderstood everything I said. We do that a lot.
Let’s cool off and revisit this. When you said you were just gonna “tell everyone the truth” my point was we were a married couple. They have no
business, knowing what the truth is. That was our own private business.
Creating enemies of our families does not help our kids. I don’t want you to be my enemy and I don’t want your family to be my enemy and I would
like my family to have a good relationship with you.
So with that in mind, let’s just please cool off . we are both triggered and we can have this discussion some other time. Let’s don’t make a
misunderstanding, even worse.

Soooo... I am checking in peacefully ahead of time to wave the white flag from my trench as we get started. I don’t have anything pressing to chat

My offer for a strategic pause still stands. We could really use a larger pause and honestly some professional intervention, but I can’t do that alone.
So no complaints, bitching, arguing to ruin your day! Let’s just keep our “cooling off” from yesterday rolling. If you need me, I’m here to help in any

We have bills to pay Robert and have more to pay.
I am aware you have two Amex cards in your name. You have a Visa card linked to the fidelity account with msft stock. I believe I have a Visa card too
to this account but I don’t use it.
Your separate BofA account should have a debit card but I am uncertain how you funded that,l account and if funds are in there.
I have an Amex card, a chase card and an Alaska Visa card under my name. I have a debit card linked to my separate BofA account.
We both have a BofA debit card that is linked to the joint checking account.

- All Visa cards you mention are debit cards. I don't need a debit card.
- You mentioned that I have AMEX cards. I don't need another AMEX.
- You have several Visa cards and I have none. I am asking for a Visa.
And, of course, our BofA is linked to our joint checking. And I NEVER touch that because it would screw you like you did me yesterday. You made
that clear to me, and I have always respected that. I am not sure why that is not a two-way street for us. It's just mutual respect.

See attached for some spend that looked like yours from joint BofA jt. I can pull more, but if you are saying these are not yours they will need to be

I’d still like to come to an agreement on what parts of our private married life we are going to air for all to see and read because you feel some inherent
need to “tell everyone the truth.” about our marriage.
I don’t want to create unnecessary enemies. It’s not good for anyone. And the public has no right to know all that you and I got up to as a couple or
with others outside our marriage. There is no benefit to that.
Ideally we agree to chart a “least destructive path” forward that keeps our private life together, just that. We lasted 30 years. That is amazing. For real. I

Money withdrawals are happening and actual spend. Debit card fraud is incredibly difficult to get reimbursed if fraud so we need to notify bank
immediately. If you don’t answer I’ll get attorney guidance on this. You have stated you never spend in that account.

You never get it. Everything is transactional for you. It’s more than the investigation. I’m talking about the well-fair of our kids and keeping that part

and not trash each other and that includes friends and family.
Your response is always that it’s time to tell the truth. You’re tired of lying to people. I’m pretty sure that it’s up to you what you tell them about our
past just as it is for me. I’ve been mum on all the things that we did. At the time we did them because we liked it. You, by contrast have started an
advertising campaign of destruction and defamation.
So I’m asking if can we agree to stop doing that and work on honoring the years we spent together. If you don’t understand, please take some time off
work and educate yourself. It’s not a knock, you just don’t  know. So I’m asking you to learn how your vengeful flamethrower approach is impacting
the kids.
Frankly, I’m tired of having this discussion. All our messaging platforms are replete with examples of me, trying to get this under control and not treat
each other in horrible, thoughtless, and inhumane ways that screw up our kids for the rest of their lives. I’m actually tired of trying to convince you to

Hey-
I don't want to escalate this any further than you already have by emailing me with Natalie CC'd. You know she has sent numerous messages to Lisa
about pursuing legal action against me if I do anything that violates your admittedly wrong RO. That feels like an attempt to get me to do that.
This whole thing boils down to the fact that you are taking a statement by me so literally that it's counterproductive. You secretly took $10k from an
account where I said the money was earmarked. I responded by saying I don't do that to our BofA account so you could manage bills.
In response, you've gone through and picked out my grocery bills at Safeway, a $300 withdrawal, and a single bill pay to create some false equivalency
as if you're catching me out. Then used that to ask me If the activity was fraud. I confirmed below that no action was necessary from you.
So, from my perspective, it feels like you're playing games. Between the email with Natalie CC'd, ignoring the fact that I said no action is necessary
below, and the comparison between my grocery shopping at Safeway and you taking $10k, I feel like you are harassing me now.
I also sent an OFW message earlier today asking that we stand down as we are too triggered, and it would be counterproductive. You agreed but then
doubled down 'off platform.' I don't know how to work with you, Christine. Please consider a more constructive way for us to collaborate.

I am asking you for your rules about giving my son his presents. I am not trying to force myself on anyone or any place. That is what this thread says-
your rules. I am happy to meet you at Sbux and do a drop-off or exchange. This is in AD's best interest.
It is healthy for him to see I care about him. I am 50% of him and when you teach him to hate me, you teach him to hate himself. Please let me know. I
can meet you as you go to the play date or after your workout if that makes it easier. This is a reasonable ask.

I want to clarify that I didn’t say my communications with Adrian caused him distress. I mentioned it was an emotional situation covering a range of
feelings, not distress. If you identify anything contrary, please highlight it rather than just say it to create a narrative.
I agree working with a counselor on child-related matters would be great. I hope we can take their advice seriously moving forward rather than using
the internet and lawyers for guidance. It’s important for Adrian to feel supported without being caught in the middle of our issues.
I also wouldn’t expect Adrian to feel uncomfortable with either of us. It’s unfair to assume emotions are caused by just one parent without looking at
the big picture. To explain, I'd start with "Divorce poison: How to protect your family from bad-mouthing and brainwashing."
And before we forget what the title of the tread is, let’s figure out a communication plan that keeps both of us informed about our children's well-
being. I'm not comfortable with your presumed sole custody absent due process and want an effective channel to co-parent safely.

Sounds like you don’t read visitation reports.
Sharing again here to help you find in email.
I’d encourage you to follow along on these.
—————————————————-
FYI, the latest visitation report from Alan for Adrian and I is attached. We had an excellent time as always.
During our last visit, Adrian was really focused on making sure his room was ready here, as we had put it off in the past given our circumstances. We
spent about an hour and a half getting it set up, which wasn’t mentioned in the last report. The first thing he did when he arrived was run downstairs
to check if everything was still good to go, and it was.This is important to him.
Later, we looked through pictures on my phone since all the family photos had been removed from his house. I did this to show him that he comes
from
a place of love and ensure that we are all included in the pictures. We had a great time reminiscing, and Adrian enjoyed telling "his own stories" behind
the pictures. I texted him the slideshow so he could
keep those memories close and promised more.
Instead of our usual action movie, Adrian wanted to watch "IF," a childhood movie about a 12-year-old who keeps a picture of them and their parents
from better times. The story is about not losing a parent and honoring family memories. It was incredibly poignant and hit close to home.
Fortunately, the movie had a happy ending with the child reuniting with their dad. Talk about a tear-jerker.
Adrian's last two basketball games were tough, with emotional meltdowns. This time, I was able to spend time with him beforehand. He really
enjoyed
the game, was happy, laughing, and during the game, he came off the bench and said, "Nothing is wrong, Dad. I just wanted to tell you how much I
love you." For a 12-year-old boy, doing that in front of his team was a big deal to me. A WOW moment.

I am grateful Adrian got an opportunity to remember what we truly were for a bit. Even if Christine and I disagree on adult issues, he sees nothing
but love and support for what we were as a family. The visits gives him time, space, and permission to honor the part of himself that he has lost
touch with. Lots of laughs, wrestling, and healthy teasing made us feel normal for a few hours.

This style of cooperation, really makes it hard to co-parent from my perspective. But please add "no typos" to our OFW rules.

I started with a pretty snarky mail about your nuking all our subscriptions from Microsoft to Comcast to Apple so we pay not only double and triple
now but we have no family sharing either.
So I’ll just let you know that one of the kids Xbox Live subscriptions has expired and I would prefer that we let me use the Microsoft discount I
earned rather than go your route on these.
I honestly don’t know what the harm is letting me see what language Adrian is taking in Duolingo or Max’s favorite game pack that he’s downloaded .
Even if it is tracking, it’s my kids too, right?

you hide it and secretly make these moves for something I had earmarked for something else.
We had a plan to move money regularly that we agreed to. I noted several times I do not do that to the BofA account because it would screw you.
Your retort was to show me Safeway grocery charges were mine, and I confirmed they were.
If you somehow think $250 equals the $25k you just moved without so much as a peep you were doing it, we have an issue. The bigger problem is you
are doing this intentionally now with forethought and malice after I asked for a heads-up.
Why are you doing this, given we had an agreed-on solution, and I asked you to work with me instead of doing it secretly? As always, we had a plan to
ensure BofA would be funded. Yet you moved 25k without so much as a peep to me.
This creates yet another huge trust issue. To repeat myself from last week, how would you feel if I moved huge sums of money out of BofA when you
were trying to pay bills? You asked me not to do that, and while I bought groceries, I don't.
Please advise, as the entire discussion is in OFW. I am truly baffled at this intentional deception.

Are you stealing from us? We just had this discussion Wed, yet today you took another $16k.

The market, in general, is pretty healthy. That said, I do watch and make moves that maximize our gains. I have always done this, and the market has
never beaten me.
While I do not claim to be an expert, I feel like I am super lucky or have enough domain knowledge in the tech sector to make reasonably sound
predictions.
Examples include exiting Tesla, entering Nvida, and selling AMD and MSFT at 52-week highs. You would have been out on those moves and lost
potential gains.
So... if we wanted to consider an approach where I sell something (AMZN or AMD) and we spilt those proceeds now w/o splitting everything, it
might behoove you to consider.
I am not going to die on this hill. I will continue to manage my portfolio and try to do what I have always done. But if you want to slipstream off that,
I am happy to continue.
If you do not understand what I am saying or think I am trying to do something nefarious, I will be doing it to myself as well in this scenario, which I
have no interest in doing.
We may be fighting like cats and dogs right now, but long term I want you to be as successful as we always have been. And I'm rooting for you for you
to do great things.

would be used for discretionary spending. The net being is we don't want to pay for each other's Botox or massages.  We would need to agree on that
definition, but we could do that.
So, if that is the case and the lawyers are interpreting your ask correctly, I will proceed. If that is not the case and the lawyer <-> lawyer

Yes split that joint fidelity account 50/50. All other accounts will be frozen, including fidelity with msft stock, retirement accounts, hsa accounts etc,
so no further stock sales or movement of money out.
The amount we receive now will be factored in once we finalize the final asset split.
The amount we receive will be used by each of us to pay our own expenses moving forward. You pay your rent, upkeep of rental, insurance, food,
clothing, etc. Yes I pay for my Botox, and other personal expenses including home mortgage payment, clothing etc
At final settlement, we will settle up anything that was paid individually that should have been borne by the other party.
Kid related expenses will be split temporarily 50/50. We will need to align what these are like tuition, camp fees, school related expenses etc. my
suggestion is we both deposit an equal agreed upon amount from our split of funds, into the jt BofA bank account, and only use that for kids
expenses. Ie monthly tuition payments due starting July. No personal spend from that account or it will need to be reimbursed.
My income is my separate income, as is any income you may earn, and will be deposited into our separate accounts.
I will stop college contributions for the kids and savings into Vanguard until we can align what are contribution should be.
I believe the cash deposit from your Deferred Comp plan was earned during the marriage, as are your remaining RSUs that are vesting. Those should
be preserved until final asset split. I will treat the vesting Sbux RSUs granted during our marriage the same way. How these are treated will be finalized
in the split.

We share the same text and email history. You should be as aware of what was shared as I am. If I have seen any pics that were of an adult nature, I
have deleted them. I have told you that many times and it is still true. I obviously sent pics too. Please let me know if you have done the same.
My concern below was about handing a “complete history” of our texts and emails where something could still exist. Not to mention the fact our
“complete history” won’t match each other. If you are going to turn this into another harassment opportunity I’m stepping away.

decisions separate from our counsel, as demonstrated by your history with the pareting plans.

- Christine- why haven't you sent the Hong Kong release?
- Robert, why haven't you fixed the incorrect RO on record?
Our OFW is filled with you saying, "Speak to your lawyer." I have respected that, and let's use your same tool to avoid conflict here. But if we can
figure things out peacefully, that will be very helpful and save us money. Even if it is for only 50% of the things, that is 50% we will save on.

Boys summer schedule was shared with you.
Jennifer was informed of Max and Adrian's dates (including Max in Texas and Hong Kong) and expressed no concerns. After yesterday, she said she
will think about her proposal, and will come back with recommendation.
I am asking Kari for dates in July for Adrian. Max has asked to pause for now.
Do you mind sharing a full list of all the therapy that you are proposing both kids skip to accommodate the schedule you are proposing?
I swear to god, Christine. There were so many better ways to have done this. I was so onboard for us and the boys. Also the healthiest I had (and we
had) ever been.
If you had just said- "let's take care of my scar tissue like you have been asking me to do" or even "i'm still gonna leave you, but let's do it peacefully and
in a healthy way"
I will never understand why you had to do it this way. If there was damage before, what is there now?

Stated he did not want to do it.
I asked if you had spoken to him about participating in the league. He said no. I said, I thought he wanted to and had discussed with you. If there was
a miscommunication, to connect with you directly.
Yes - Agree to engage lawyers on this one.
So, AD said you spoke to him and let him know he would be gone for the summer. I think I will take issue with your assertion of 100% parental
control. Please don't go after him again like you did last time because of what he said to me.

And then for vacations, how we handle them. Let's not fight; we know the deal. All our "at cost" stuff was given away (Presidential, Executive, Studio)
or is not usable till Oct. I know I banked Rancho, you canceled Sol Mar. Can we agree on something? If we can't let's not bother. Let's let the lawyers

The mortgage tuition and other big bills are due.

I have been trying to work with you all day. And you refuse and then say you don't understand
I want to talk about the kids and what get some feedback so we are better co-parents for them.
I have a ton of questions about the bills and finances. I am trying to work with you, but you won't.
Can you please call for five minutes so we can stop this and figure out how to move forward?

I won’t talk to you when you pepper the communications with statements with digs and issues you state as facts and are not. I have stated repeatedly I
refuse to defend or refute because that’s how you draw me into a longer conversation and confrontation.
You then accuse me of not working with you.
The finances are a known, the timing and what the amounts we need to pay are. They are due Robert. The mortgage, the tuition. To act any different
is disingenuous.
The spend we have/had was based on two incomes. You have decided not to participate in that anymore. You have since increased your spend. I
broke down the chase card. I am 12.5% of that spend. You will see the breakdown.
The result is you have put me in a situation where I am now reliant on you to sell stock to pay my expenses. This is another way you have decided to
control me.
I have asked to split finances immediately.
The delay is another example of your attempts to control.
The travel authorization. People are waiting for you to return that to either finalize plans or decide if they need to change plans.
We have Cabo as a proxy of what you will do. You refused to return it despite saying you are not saying “no”.
I have a full work day. I have demonstrated how you will repeatedly interrupt it. This is another example.

We were so successful, Christine. From stocks to real estate. We did not just 'dumb luck' our way into our money, going all the way back to Cisco 25
years ago. We were thoughtful and planful. Ying to each other Yang. We are good at this.
I sincerely hope we find a way to communicate so we don't make foolish or impulsive mistakes.
Let's figure out how to co-parent first, then we can make more rational, generational decisions.

I worked hard to create and maintain this for the Kids and Family events. You obviously don't allow that anymore. I might have some visibility on
important dates, but only if I catch them in the email and get all the updates.
Examples:
- Lot's of my events are out of date now- like anything school-related
- Some are wrong- like the Dr Kwon visit I showed for that was cancelled
- Some conflict- like I have AD down for Kari and Jennifer at 5:00 Monday
I also have no way to contact you in a timely way if I have a question.
Examples:
- AD is missing basketball because you misunderstood
- AD stranded w/ no phone, no ride, and not at the bus stop
- AD has no ride home while sitting in the Nurse's office
- AD needs to leave basketball at halftime w/ a breakdown
I acknowledge you assert that you are the only parent to our children and act accordingly. But may I request that you reconsider the situation and

Documented here in OFW i informed you of the facts regarding Adrian summer basketball participation, desire not to do it, and his statement to you
was not based on what I told him about not being able to do it.
You have chosen to ignore this documented communication to you and have used your lawyer to communicate a false narrative.
Documenting I have this OFW message and reflects your decision and choice to engage lawyers to spend time and money on this false narrative.

Documenting this was communicated to you and timing.
Mortgage, insurance etc are also coming due.
We had an agreement for at least 25k per month to cover some expenses paid from BofA.
Your lawyer has stated no division of assets unless we agree to your conditions to equalize income and I bear a greater portion of children costs.
I did not see proposal on how to pay bills that are coming due that you have been made aware of.
I don’t see the cash in the other fidelity account, and have no access, so shall assume that is not being used to pay your bills that are due until the
disagreement on how to pay bills and who has access to what cash, what permissions are need to move it, pay bills is resolved.
You have demanded I request permission to move cash to pay bills. Assume same conditions placed on you.
Assuming your lawyer is aware you did not ask permission to pay your 31k for your Amex card.

Ok-
Rather than triggering a fight, I am just moving $35k to BofA from MSFT now. It's at a 52-week high and ready for some pullback.
If I do it straight from Moyer, I think we might have to cover the margin first and I'd rather do it my way than fight about that.
I am happy to work with you on fine-tuning our monthly move. We can get this dialed in till we divorce. It's not rocket science.

selective adoption of therapy rules is not all what I proposed.
BTW- “Till we get a determination” , I realize you have outsourced your marriage in parenting to a series of lawyers, Susan, James, Annalisa, Natalie,
but on my side, I make the decisions. So no “determination” happens without me. I hope you will consider taking control again. This doesn’t work.

Got it- Therapy counts as 1-1 visitation time to you.  I disagree but you twist it up as you like.
Then, the next time I see him will be in two weeks. He has expressed concerns to us that I have documented and shared that "Alan" time is not real-
time. So you know that. Given that is the only thing that you are even permitting this summer, is it fair to say that I might not get to have this
conversation mano-mano till there is a parenting plan (Sept?)
Stepping back, you, as a highly educated person, have to be able to see that you have decided unilaterally to be a vigilante parent, unenforceable by
law. You have had 4 lawyers, 6 therapists, and 7 parenting plans. And here we are. You have effectively learned how to "donald trump" family law. It's
unenforceable, just my choice not to be an a-hole about it.
So when can I see my son 1-1 to discuss the trip? That is healthy for him mentally of course.

I’d love if we could have a two way conversation about the mental health of our kids and doing what is right by them for both of us. So can we have a
one topic conversation about our kids? You keep logging on, shooting arrows and logging off immediately. It’s not helpful.
One is leaving the state. The other is coming back to shore and I won’t see him for two weeks at best except maybe therapy. I had zero say in anything
this summer after being the primary caregiver giver last year across three different countries. Sixty six total days w/o you. The same number of days
without incident.
And in the last two weeks:
- You did not allow me even a hello for his birthday
- You didn’t take him basketball so I missed him there
- You threatened legal action for our phone call
- You would not let me drop gifts off at the mailbox
- You will not permit a welcome home hug from me
- And just now, you asserted you have a plan the allows me zero visits apart from the six supervised hours every two weeks. And that is all I get, period.
I reread the communications. You are incorrect. And it speaks to other options to see him in the same mail. Your assertion is patently false. You know
that.
I am asking you again, please don’t block me from my children or my children from me. Just like his birthday, then his gift dropped at the mailbox, his
basketball games, this hug is simple, harmless, but a small gesture that demonstrates I am there for him. No matter what adult business we have going
on. He sees he is number one, not taking a backseat to personal agendas. I know this is healthy for him.
I think it really comes down to the fact that you believe you are the singular parent to our children and  they are better off with only you instead than
having both of us. I don’t know a single expert, who says that. Please reconsider your total blackout. You were not even in the country for 2.5 months
last year and I did great! After no mishaps- I get nothing?
Please reconsider, this is so small and still so big.
Thanks!

So... you did your standard drive-by and logged off. Here is what Natalie will tell you:
My stipulation is just a temporary arrangement that outlines supervised visitation with AD, specifying six hours every other Saturday, supervised by
Alan, and includes participation in reunification counseling with Jennifer and me. That is it. Nothing more or less. Done.
It is not a comprehensive residential schedule or a complete parenting plan. It does not provide a detailed weekly or monthly schedule, address legal
custody or decision-making authority, or cover holidays, school vacations, and other important aspects of our children's routine.
You know this gets old and I honestly don't care to make you look bad. And even after all the character assassination that you and your family have

So they did this.
Crazy. Crazy. It makes me reflect of course. Especially on my pleas for counseling last spring. We were the opposite. We had it all. And bed was
unquestionably the hottest and most incredibly intimate place we could be. After 30 years it could not have been better. Crazy. Crazy. At least we

I just sent you my photo getting my Vivitrol shot. You knew I could not show signs of drinking. So did you explain that was medically impossible?

was "mini-me" until you did this.
You have continued to limit contact between us, further creating a space for misconceptions to grow and create unfamiliarity. It's natural for children
to struggle with understanding complex adult situations, but without regular, positive interactions with both parents, these misunderstandings can
solidify into harmful beliefs.
Let's work together to increase my time with Adrian. This would allow him to form his own opinions based on direct experiences rather than

stopped every memory of me from him.
For AD's best interests, I would propose:
- Increase my time with Adrian, including more frequent visits and activities. We saw each other daily this time last year
- Consideration of family counseling sessions to help navigate our overall situation. You have never allowed this to happen.
- Involve a family therapist or mediator to create a balanced, positive co-parenting environment. You have refused this.
You are probably not the best messenger as I am your target. He has no safe space as he has to please you for the basic necessities of life. And not
explaining the medical impossibility of what he said seems misguided. This of course, also calls into question past recollections from you and he.
Example: Cabo is your favorite.
Attachment theory explains that a child's emotional and psychological development is deeply influenced by the quality of their bond with their
caregivers. When one parent targets another, this bond is disrupted, making reunification therapy ineffective if it is bookended by the alienating
parent's influence to and from the appointment.
I'm committed to addressing any concerns you or Adrian might have to ensure he has a balanced, healthy relationship with both of us, benefiting his
emotional well-being and our ability to co-parent effectively. Could we discuss a plan to help Adrian with professional support to ensure the best
psychological outcome?

I hope you will consider getting help for us; that's all at this point. Trying to win a point here or a point there does more collateral damage than it's
worth. "The juice is not worth the squeeze," as we said.
There is no harm in trying something new at this point. What is the worst that can happen? The courts would probably appreciate it if we could
proactively agree to some improvements before we see them.
If my suggestions make you uncomfortable, I'm all ears... honestly.

Proposal is jt BofA is just for kids expenses, jointly funded.
Move personal spend currently impacting jt account (and msft fidelity account) to be paid out of own bank account or personal credit card.
Some of your expenses I see on jt BofA to move are ATT cell phone, comcast, puget sound energy, medical insurance (business solver), care insurance
which is long term care insurance (transamerica), rocket money. There may be others. No personal withdrawals or personal spend with debit card
from jt account.

See communication below on June 14th which I shared to you.

issue.
2) He did not want to do it, which he told you.
I asked you to confirm prior to sign ups, Adrian did in fact want to do it, given he did not like Spring Hoops. You said yes and sign him up.
Your lawyer sent communication on June 18th which included below. You were aware this was a false statement.
Christine then told Adrian he could not participate in basketball due to their summer travel plans. Adrian called Robert to tell him.

From prior communications, I understood you were not impacting that account, however as noted below and attached, and based on Rocket Money,
your personal bills are still coming out of funds in this jt account.
I saw a Safeway purchase yesterday using your debit card.
As these bills have not yet come out of the account - you can go into the accounts online or call, and update so have these bills paid from your credit

A year ago today, our lives changed irrevocably. After months of intense emotional connection, I kissed you and our kids goodbye as you left for
Hong Kong. The same people never returned. The moment you landed, you were bombarded with a stream of hate and vitriol. Our daughter missed
her flight, and somehow, this was all your fault because you got the boys on the plane but not our 31-year-old.
It was as if a long-dormant emotional monster, held inside for the last three decades, was suddenly unleashed. Elsa berated you relentlessly, telling you
over and over what an awful mother you were and how you had ruined her life. It was unbearable, and then you asked me to step in; the abuse was
soul-crushing, and to be honest, you sounded as if you would break. Even as I tried, I could not stem the tide of Elsa, the blame, the hate.
In the following days, you revisited the same spots you frequented when you were pregnant as a teenager, staring at the harbor with the sights and
sounds of Hong Kong in full effect. The vibrant colors of the city, the bustling streets, and the smell of the sea must have triggered a flood of
memories. My heart aches for the emotions you must have felt and the onslaught of painful memories you endured on the heels of the assault.
Then you talked with Lilian, who piled on with stories of me being drunk on a visit before the pandemic. I had embarrassed your family and never
been back to apologize. This was unforgivable, and she let it be known what a coward I was for my absence, not apologizing face-to-face even years
later. I deeply regret this incident and acknowledge that my past actions seriously strained our relationship. For that, I am genuinely sorry.
Our minds, fresh from our own spring of self-created amateur “mushroom therapy” to help ease our own trauma and PTSD scars, were perhaps also
open to triggers we were unaware of. It was the downside of uncontrolled experimentation with neuroplasticity, And we would never be the same. All
the pain, anguish, and deep hurt came out in our next phone call. After all that was happening and a well-deserved reason to blame me, I became the
target.
After the best months of our life as a family and married couple, I was the problem now and had been all along from this point of view. Everything
that had happened and gone wrong since leaving Hong Kong was my fault. Then, after you landed, Max told me that in Hong Kong, you had decided
to divorce me when you all got home. Since then, my life has been rewritten, and others have taken over my marriage and parenting.
The changes have profoundly affected our children in the last year, who left that day as happy and optimistic kids and now see us as lifelong enemies.
My primary concern has always been their well-being, and I am committed to maintaining a healthy relationship with them even as this explodes
around us. I have continued to take steps towards sobriety and reconciliation and worked hard to improve myself as a parent.

I am fully committed to cooperating with professionals, including Connor and Jennifer, to ensure the best possible outcomes for them. I hope for a
positive co-parenting relationship with you, and I am dedicated to providing a stable, nurturing environment for Max and Adrian. My goal is to move
forward constructively, focusing on the well-being of our children and the potential for a harmonious family dynamic and will continue.
I have done so much research and pored over books, presentations, and white papers, all of which I am happy to share with you. But please know that
It is very possible that the intense emotional experiences and unresolved past traumas, combined with mushrooms, triggered a mental regression in us.
Psychedelic substances sometimes unlock deep-seated memories, bringing them to the surface in unexpected and overwhelming ways.
The sudden flood of painful memories and unresolved trauma, especially those tied to your formative years in Hong Kong, could have caused an
intense psychological reaction that may have led to a well-deserved sense of anger and overdue blame towards me that had been simmering for years. It
was what we talked about fixing before you left. Understanding this does not excuse any harm I have done, but it might help explain the instant
change.
Our passion burns white-hot on both sides of the coin. There is no in-between with us. We went from being the two most seemingly in love people
the world had ever seen to mortal enemies. So for one moment, just a moment, please, after 30 years together, fighting like cats and dogs and
snuggling toes and making love, consider the fact that perhaps we flew too close to the sun and our wings melted. But let's remember who we were,
acknowledge who we've become, and see if we can forge a new path of understanding. But we don’t have to hate each other.
It's been a long year. May we please consider a change?

Let’s don’t blow it out or proportion though. It’s a thing we can work on. Not a big deal.
And today was a win! Neither of us got what we wanted but we did not yell or hang up on each other. We both communicated some outstanding

Those things are different and I am getting frustrated when this could have been a 30 second call and you don’t seem to understand the ask on the

Is there a way we can work on communicating better? We could have spent the morning together instead of him playing video games. Frankly, he has
no idea what's happening, so I assume it is not a big deal.
Plus, it can't be a tradition. The 4th of July was the biggest holiday of our year. Our tradition. The boys and I had everything planned, and the beach
camp was prepped early, ready to pamper MOM. It was our family's big day!
I guess I am just super hurt. You take every holiday, every break, everything. Even the things that were solely focused on us just chilling as a happy and
healthy family together and being thankful for each other. I have all the pics!
I feel like I'm dead to the family, and it's not right, especially after your secret 4th last year.

childhood memories from our house, but this is who we were as a family. So I'd love to see him for the fireworks tonight to remember.
Of course, I also understand today is your "Independence Day" with Kevin, but tbh, he doesn't even know AD apart from the few times you made
them eat together. So, I'd appreciate it if we could continue our Moyer family traditions and let you and Kevin just create your own.

It is always tough to talk to them when you have the kids. I think we saw that yesterday. Ideally, you would suggest some convenient windows to chat
and even note some of your activities that I could ask them about so they know we are on the same "parent team."
It is incredibly awkward for us to talk while they are on vacation and not be able to say, "Tell me about your day" without them feeling like they are
being a spy by saying anything about their vacation or I am spying on them to try and figure out what's up.
If we can't find a good way to keep me current and in the loop with the kids, given all that you have arranged away from me overseas in July, it's going
to be a super long month and really unhealthy. I'll need you to help overcome the barriers put up.
- Nov-Feb: Saw AD about five times a week
- March-June: Saw AD about three times a week
- June-Today: See AD once every two weeks
- July: I'll see AD twice this month after 66 days solo last summer
The longer I demonstrate my sobriety, the less I see my kids. So please help me stay in touch while you jet-set around the world, taking every single
holiday they had since last year. Especially back to where they said, "Mom said we are divorcing you in Hong Kong."
Your help will be much appreciated as you have taken sole custody and left the country.

I’ve obviously powered through our homework books from Jennifer. I’m sure she feels like these are important for us to read and understand so we
can be better parents raising Max and AD.
But the last two books are only available in hard copy and on Kindle. So I read them and I am realizing that will be a challenge for you given the
limited cycles you have and our history trying to find time.
So I figured out a way to “de-drm” the books, convert to PDF, and then use an accessibility app to read the book aloud as if you were on Spotify. It’s
not as good as Audible but it’s a still way easier.
It’s all paid for if we use the family sharing we agreed on to save money. So I’d like to set you up. Then at least you can listen on the way to and from
work. I can make this brain dead simple for you.
Please let me do what I have always done for us, and give you a little edge or leg up to be more successful. The sooner we operate from a place of
common understanding the better the kids will be.
Please let me know... it will take 10 minutes max and save you days trying to find time between meeting to sit and take notes with a hard copy. And
you can always go back and do that if you need.
I hope you’ll let me, help you, help us, help the kids.
Thanks!

Thank you for the offer. I am good.
Strange on availability as I thought I I ordered them in paperback version. They should be at the house when I return.

You are welcome.
Please consider the request I sent for time and opportunity with the kids. It is based on professional guidance from Dr. Brown, a well-respected Co-
Parenting counselor I see, and consistent with the books Jennifer has asked us to read. It is the healthy thing to do.
I'd also appreciate your partnership getting us all together with Jennifer ASAP, before HK for sure. I don't think there is an argument, so please let me
know if you disagree. I honestly hope we start with an intervention since Kari refused, but we will let Jennifer decide of course.
So, I'd like us to agree that we will both move heaven and earth for our boys. It starts with making sure that the people and processes we have agreed to
adopt and follow happen promptly—i.e., Jennifer's plan. Running out the clock does not make sense for anyone.
No time like the present to do the right thing for Max and Adrian. We on the same page?

The best practices were what we paid Dr. Brown for. Not you picking email rules and ignoring the actual therapist part of the engagement noted

Best practices are actually in the two books that Jennifer asked you to read. Should we agree that we will start following those now? I’m game.

I have taken it up with Lisa, and she has sent emails to Natalie. Those have been ignored last week.
Now you know that they have been ignored, is it still your advice for me to go through legal channels?
Divorce and child custody is a $28 billion business. I’m asking to do something helpful for Max and Adrian not pay for college and vacations for
someone else.
You outsourced parenting to lawyers. I’m going to hold firm that they may be well intentioned but unqualified to be my kids decision makers.

If you have responded, you made my point. Our conversation and the mental health outcome of our kids is sitting somewhere in an email folder
between the three degrees of separation established in the $28 billion parenting model that’s been chosen. (that number is 5-years old btw)
This time last year I was floating down the lazy river and lining up for adventures in Leavenworth with both our kids, their friends, and Katherine’s
family. I was an amazing dad then and have only improved. There is no legal reason for me to be blocked right now so we should discuss how I can
parent our kids.

Here is what I had asked of you that I wanted to reach an agreement on as well for the kids:
"’l'll just wait till everyone is home before reaching out.
Are there things I can ask about that you all did so we can have a natural conversation and it not feel like “spying.”
I want him to feel at ease and see we are aligned when it comes to him. We don’t keep secrets and this is normal."
Please let me know so I can engage in a way that he feels comfortable. AD has not picked up in five days, and that gives me pause with your travel
plans and our inability to work together on healthy solutions. You did not even answer this.
I'll also ask that you give Max his gifts that I have sent to the house. It is important that the kids know that even while you have declared all our war on
me and removed every single reference to me in their lives, that I still think of them.
If this is going to be like my meds or UAs, and you are just going to refuse to give him my gifts, please let me know. I'll obviously have to make it a
legal issue, but I REALLY do not want to do that for something as simple and reasonable as this.

Your position is there is no reason the kids do not have time with you.
There is no reflection or acknowledgement of the cumulative and long lasting impact your actions over the decades have had on all of us.
To attack the family that provided support and protection to kids and I, and to yourself over decades is telling.
To state it is all heresay is also telling. Why even look from that viewpoint unless you intend to deny all the incidents or take the position that everyone
is lying.
You did everything that was been outlined. Every one of them.
Your position is either we are all lying or yes you did it, but ignore the impact.
Ultimately we all know the truth.
If you are able to convince Connor or others,  what has been described were lies made up by me, kids, family and friend’s, that will be informative as
well. Everyone who has been impacted will have their own perspective and view of that outcome, but facts don’t change.

Cabo was remaining issue as noted last week in your response. Rosen could have been cancelled last week but for whatever reason your side made

In my POV that is strange and expensive to hold Rosen for this one issue but strategy you decided to take.
The money in attorney fees generated by Cabo discussion is an interesting choice on your side but it is your choice and spend.

Blocking what? Cabo was an issue you raised last minute, over the holiday weekend, using your lawyer. We responded immediately on Monday.
This is documented. We can share details and timeline with Rosen if you want to blame.
Your lawyer is blocking if they have not shared with you and no way for you to respond.
Why did you use your lawyer on this issue at the last minute, if you really wanted to align without lawyers?

You use your lawyer, then it seems you are asking me not to respond through my lawyer? Thats strange.
You are continuing to make the decision to have lawyers manage this issue. If it’s solved then that’s all you needed to tell them but you have not.
Again you sent this through your lawyer over the holiday break, then they left town.
What was expectation on your side for reviewing and managing a response? I did not see in your letter, I’m sending this over the holiday weekend,
but because I will be away when you respond, please have Christine respond directly with Robert.
How was Lisa supposed to cancel Rosen if she’s gone?
It appears your strategy was never to cancel Rosen as that would have been impossible given Lisa is out and could not review any response after the
holidays.
I guess I have my answer.
We will be discussing Cabo solely on Friday. All other matters are resolved. It should be quick but cost thousands.

That is one of the things parents who are targeted to be erased are advised to do. Like my volunteer stuff and attendance at everything he does. At
some point he will look back and know that the man who he is named after, loved him unconditionally.
He might even realize that if everyone got to just kick people out of their family when they were unhappy with them, there would not be any families
at all.

Message 3560 of 4024
Christine-
Adrian met with Kari yesterday, and we received an excellent report card. During their conversation, they decided I would attend the next
appointment to address some things on Adrian's mind. This is a significant breakthrough, as it's the first time he has agreed to have me join his session
in all the months he has been going.
I am excited about this opportunity, especially considering our near-total estrangement and the upcoming trip to Hong Kong, where all of these
issues began after Elsa and your Mother's advice. The timing is perfect for a breakthrough, especially given the professional advice that there might be
better ideas than the Hong Kong trip. 
I wanted to let you know that I was looking forward to a professionally facilitated discussion. However, you intervened and stopped it. You listed
many reasons against it and stated that Adrian voted against attendance because that would mean two full hours in a single week and you two felt like
that was too much to invest.
My Concerns:
- I think you should have talked with me instead of letting Adrian vote on therapy without discussing it.
- As the targeting parent, your influence in this discussion with him may affect his decision to talk to me.
- You are making 100% of the mental health decisions for our family without any legal authority to do so.
- This is not what the books Jennifer recommended say to do. We need to heed the advice we were given.
Reflection:
During my first reunification meeting, you told Adrian that I had not blown, implying I was under the influence, which is medically impossible as I
am on Vivitrol. Despite knowing this, you and Natalie demanded I take two 12-panel tests.
This is akin to giving Max a pregnancy test after a date – unnecessary and misleading. This demonstrates either a total lack of understanding of my
sobriety program (big issue) or nefarious intentions. (bigger issue.) by you two.
Either way, your actions misled Adrian, and you both used him as a pawn, especially troubling given Kari's concern that he was considering self-harm
because he was caught in the middle when we started with her. He thinks this was him.
Recap:
- First reunification session: Adrian was misled and used as a pawn.
- First requested Father/Son session: You unilaterally canceled it.
Moving forward, I hope that any decisions regarding our children's mental health (or any other significant decisions) will involve me.
Additionally, I ask that we collectively make an effort to:
- Start being honest with Adrian
- Stop defaming me as his father
- Avoid using Adrian as your pawn
I remain optimistic because you were always a great mom before July. Even in December, when we had the Phase I parenting plan, things were good,
and we worked well together.
ASK:
- Stop interfering with the mental health engagements run by professionals

That was only issue remaining last week? We have repeatedly asked this question.
The delay and refusal to cancel had been on your side.
Your side is either intentionally avoiding this topic, or secretly planning to do Rosen and not being forthcoming.

You should have everything you asked for. Everything. I did not push back on a single demand. Nothing. You refused when I tried to work with you

beyond to screw me, cancel me and give away community property.
You did not compromise or work together on a single item—nothing. Even though you have a full salary and our cheaper home mortgage because of
my decisions to purchase and refinance, And, you actually stalled both of those things. Although you never had an issue with the cost disparity when I
was in the dump in West Seattle, you just won't allow equity in our lives.

The original language for Cabo was drafted by your lawyer, approved by you and sent to us on July 1st. This was your original proposal. We did not
write this language, it came from you.
We approved the Cabo language drafted and approved by you on July 3. Cabo was not an issue.
All issues were agreed middle of last week July 3rd.
We asked to reschedule Rosen on July 3rd.
Your lawyer sent back revised language for Cabo on Friday July 5. Your lawyer was aware everyone was out for the holiday weekend. She had receipt
of out of office replies stating as such with return on Monday. This was only issue remaining but there was no indication to cancel Rosen on your
side, as we requested. You continued to reserve right to have Rosen decide this issue.
We responded Monday July 8 am, once everyone was back in the office. Again we asked to reschedule Rosen if this was one remaining issue. Your side
did not agree to do so.
This has cost you thousands.

What a new start really means to you on OFW - OFW is a safe place for communication. The OFW message sent with story about ex-boyfriend killing
ex-girlfriend at her workplace was very alarming and I felt very unsafe. It was and still is very threatening and scary to me. Communications to be on
OFW and focus on issues related to the children.
Adrian’s visit tomorrow and what he should bring - Done.
Confirm that you will be sending my mail over - Done.
Discuss the mail I have addressed to both of us - Please confirm which one.
Confirm your stance on seeing kids before trip - Adrian had a visit with you today as scheduled
If you plan to stay at war with me as promised - ?
Agree on Hong Kong communication expectations - Please share what types of communications you are requesting from me and/or boys.
Agree on practical terms of Fridays agreement - Please send your proposal.
Figure out how to get camping stuff in garage - Please send your list.
Swap our thoughts on the house we both own - Please send your proposal.
If you think we have a parenting plan in place - This was a question in the Discovery package sent by your lawyer. I will review with my lawyer.
Understand your thoughts on our reunification - Jennifer has been engaged and has shared next steps.
Find out how many developer weeks we have - This was a question in the Discovery package sent by your lawyer. I will review with my lawyer.

I can’t stand (or believe) you did not realize that was an ad targeting joke. We have made those exact jokes for years. I thought you would see the
humor. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. There is no threat whatsoever. I don’t understand how you could just turn on a dime when this
time last year we were having lunches every day, sex three times a day and still had our regular date nights. This seems inconceivable. But I respect
where you are at and will not make jokes in bad taste again. Please forgive me.

May we please touch base tonight? I feel like we are on the cusp of communicating again. I hoped we were at a  stage where we both want to bring the
temperature down. But that’s only gonna happen if we start taking control of the situation. And that means understanding each others intent.
I am more than willing to work with you and I keep trying to show you, so I hope you know that. If we can start with better communication I am
sure we can work wonders together. I’m not going to push you, I’ll defer to the professionals and I think that should help. But nothing happens
unless we can communicate.
Please respond. I do not want to escalate. No matter what. If it’s controlling to say chat tonight, fine,
let’s do it tomorrow. When you have time. I’m not going to push and make this a test of wills when we chat. But please communicate. Without that,
nothing happens, except escalation. Please work with me.

Message 3632 of 4024
What a new start really means to you on OFW - OFW is a safe place for communication. The OFW message sent with story about ex-boyfriend killing
ex-girlfriend at her workplace was very alarming and I felt very unsafe. It was and still is very threatening and scary to me. Communications to be on
OFW and focus on issues related to the children. <<Sound good and I agree. But please note that my mail was clearly an attempt to make peace. This
was in no way a threat. I actually said: "Wanna try again? I really would like to touch base briefly off this horrible, no good, awful platform and find
some common ground. " It was sent in a playful way, referencing an ongoing joke we have had and it says specifically that I am extending an olive
branch to heal.. Adrian’s visit tomorrow and what he should bring - Done. <<Thanks. Super helpful>>
Confirm that you will be sending my mail over - Done. <<I did not get the mail I needed. I had asked separately if you have checked the mail lately.
Please advise. It is important. >>
Discuss the mail I have addressed to both of us - Please confirm which one. <<Not worth the back and forth. I'm going to open>>
Confirm your stance on seeing kids before trip - Adrian had a visit with you today as scheduled <<I'd like to consider the plan Lisa sent that was
created with a child therapist that is at least a little closer to Dr Brown's advice. I will resend it again through the attorneys>>
If you plan to stay at war with me as promised - ?
Agree on Hong Kong communication expectations - Please share what types of communications you are requesting from me and/or boys. <<I sent
this through the attorney. I will send it again if you won't talk to me and just agree. I trust you and would instead hope we just agree. I'm not going to
bother you, I need a reliable way to get in touch with you and the kids>>
Agree on practical terms of Fridays agreement - Please send your proposal. <<It is your plan. I just want to put some process around it.>>
Figure out how to get camping stuff in garage - Please send your list. <<Thermarest is the most urgent. That is what I really need ASAP. Not the Kids,
mine. Thanks>>
Swap our thoughts on the house we both own - Please send your proposal. <<This is not an OFW email. It's a $3m decision that we need to swap

For Adrian, I noted your email communication in regards to his telephone call.
I’m not comfortable sharing my thoughts with you as it does not feel safe for me.
Either way, our interpretation is just that, our POV.
As Adrian is speaking with both Kari and Jennifer, they are in a good position to determine his perspectives, separate from how you or I may view or
communicate a situation.
On a positive note, we have witnessed Adrian become increasingly more comfortable verbalizing how he feels, and addressing a situation
independently. I have noticed a marked change this year in his communication style and confidence. I am very proud of him.

I have shared that OFW and other forms of communications with you have become an unsafe space for me where I feel attacked and threatened,
causing great anxiety and fear. It is real for me.
Example: I received in one day, two very direct OFWs, one attaching an article that discusses an ex boyfriend killing his ex girlfriend at her work place,
stating how the recommended targeting was scary personal for you, and another “expressing concern” for my well being.
This is causing me great distress, they are alarming, I feel unsafe, threatened, anxious, and scared.
Below feels like another attempt to bully and shame me, disregarding my multiple communications to you, since you sent those specific ones
referenced, on the direct impact what you have sent has had to me. This is scary to me. I cry when I think about it and hyperventilate. I feel attacked.
I have on multiple occasions expressed your communications feel unsafe and bullying and abusive and am doing so again.

insurance, Amex payment etc. see attached.  Can you deposit those amounts back into the jt account. I totaled at it was about 2,510.48 but lmk if you
see different. I saw one vanguard still went through for kids savings so I’ll cancel that. I’ll split the Safeco insurance and let you know your share.
My understanding is that no personal spend from jt BofA, the msft fidelity accounts etc.
Hope Bali was good.

Adrian and I walked through SAAS opening day page.
He asked to do cross country for Fall sports. I purchased SAAS sports bags for him and Max and t shirt/sweatshirt using the jt BofA debit card.
I started a shared folder that I’m going to put receipts in and excel file to show/track expenses incurred for the kids. Lmk if you don’t see that.

I moved a portion of my 50% share of the cash proceeds from the stock sold a few weeks ago, that we are splitting.
We will need to split the rest of the stock in the account per agreement.
I set up a shared folder for kids receipts and tracking of kids spend from the Jf BofA account. Let me know if you have issues accessing
Msft fidelity account - Per agreement - there should be no cash payments, money movements or stock sales. Please confirm.
Jt Bank of America - There is still some of your personal spend from that account which should just be for kids, if you can deposit back in. Please
confirm
I sent you a list a while back of all your expenses that were hitting that will need to be stopped. Let me know if you need me to resend.
Seahawks - I set up an excel for us to pick tickets. You can have first pick. Let me know if you have issues accessing.

Thank you for the message. I agree a more friendly tone is much needed. I appreciate the outreach. I am glad you had a good trip to Bali.
Max arrived home yesterday. It was a bit of a journey to get him home, but a learning experience for him.
I saw your moms message for a visit. I sent some dates, Oct 5/6 work well for me. She said she is getting your feedback.
... are all out of town this weekend. Any chance you and I can take a deep breath and try to smoke the peace pipe? I would love to sit down and talk a
little about how we get those two crazy people we have seen over the last year to be kind to each other again.
It’s the one thing we have not tried... but when we used to do it, the risk/reward curve was always in our favor. I solemnly swear not to talk visitation
at all. Hell we don’t even need to talk “running list” at all. We can just find a way to be peaceful and graceful to each other, in a public place.
Wouldn’t it be a Christmas miracle if the kids came back to town and mom and dad (both equal parts of their whole) could actually communicate
and put them first. I honestly believe at some point the courts will ask us to do it anyway, so let’s just impress the hell out of them and beat them to

I’m proud of Max. I hope Incheon was ok. I have a good hack if the layover is more than a couple hours I can share. It’s a game changer.
October seems like it could be a really busy month I think that we have Mom, Mediation, Grand Sol Mar. I’d like to map that out with you.
It’s so much more than tone. “I’m not ready for that” has only really translated to “I’m ready to continue to have things get even worse”
We should acknowledge that, and be deliberate and transparent about our intentions because hate and destruction appears to be sustainable.

In this OFW was an attachment that showed amounts from your personal bills that are still impacting BofA.
I have sent my lawyer a list of some spend that has come out of the account since July 12 - over 2K.
If you can go in and transfer back into that account from your personal funds, that would be great, and then set up your accounts to draw from your
personal accounts too.
We will both need to transfer amounts in to cover Aug tuition bills, and make sure balance does not drop below 10K.
I sent you OFW detailing where I have been tracking Kids expenses in an excel, that has been shared with you, with receipts, that I bill to Jt Account.
I also sent OFW for Seahawks spreadsheet so we can start dividing the tickets.
For both shared accounts, can you confirm you can access them?

If you can't access let me know or let me know if you have any edits or changes.
Open to other ideas for tracking and managing the expenses we are splitting per the temporary agreement.
I had also shared with you a listing of your personal expenses that are still hitting the Jt account, which is drawing down funds to be used for the kids.
Please transfer those funds back in. We are also about to fall below the 10K threshold and will need to top up to pay for upcoming tuition and other
kids expenses.
Fidelity - I initiated a transfer of half the stock in the jt Fidelity account to my own Fidelity account per the agreement. I confirmed with Fidelity all
the stockholdings were purchased in one lot, so all have the same cost basis. I left the remaining cash balance which we will also split 50/50.

In April I called them as it was not functioning properly. At that time they could get it back on the rails, but it is so old (17 years) you could see it
degrading and they indicated it would just keep doing it. It was a temp fix. I got a quote then.
Max bumped the garage door on Monday with the car. He has started driving. That was enough to push it completely off. I forgot he had done it and
hit my button and made it worse.
I have them coming out on Sunday to look and give another quote.

Dear Lisa
I think both parties and the boys should have a preliminary session before we start talking about changing the temporary plan we have in place. I did
hear that Robert wanted this weekend again with Adrian, and I agreed to another weekend visit this weekend.
I understand at the last visitation they played ping pong and they had lunch. I would like your client to consider a more constructive activity with
Adrian that would be a little more meaningful towards building a relationship. I think they might spend some time brainstorming with the supervisor
ideas and then there could be enthusiasm built around doing more fun activities.
You may know I have 6 boys (now adults) and 11 grandchildren, and they always wanted to do something and with nice weather that could be a
sports game, an exhibition, a fair, go on a hike, etc and on rain days a science museum, a home depot project event, Dave and Busters- you get the idea.
There is so much to do around here I urge your client to build fun time and activities with Adrian as well as just doing lunch and a game of ping pong.

So now I need to move here to track emails rather than actually communicate and ask questions. That is super unfortunate. But I am at your mercy.

When can I ask questions for the doctor since you are our only mouthpiece and have gone from email, to text, to call, to text, to OFW in the space of a
few hours. It’s really hard to chase you down and communicate in a timely way when I’m playing Where’s Waldo about my son’s heart condition.
Please ask:
- What might have caused this AFib episode, and how can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?
- What kind of follow-up or monitoring should we do to keep an eye on his heart health?
- Is there anything long-term we should be concerned about, or could this be a sign of something else?
Beyond my family history, if you remember this time last year I was solving his cardio problem. I think that was a total of five appointments in three
weeks? I also track everything with his medication and ADHD treatment. I hope you will involve me next time. I know more about Max and his
health and medication than anyone alive, including him. I can help.

Reference to “block from both of us “ is inflammatory.
Max had multiple confidential discussions with Seattle Children’s and has ability and right to ask and share certain things. I was not privy to those
conversations as they asked me to step out each time. If you have an issue with Max’s decisions please raise it with Jennifer directly.
If you had concerns with actions Seattle Children’s took please also raise those directly with them.

Thanks you. I’m glad to hear that Max is physically okay after last night’s scare. I am concerned about the mental aspect, especially the screaming
"Robert stay away" into the phone. That isn’t normal, and we should consider accelerating therapy as he is getting worse.
Regarding his medication, as you know, Dr. Kwon involves me in discussions about Max’s Vyvanse—his dosage, diet, and overall health. Last time,
we agreed to reduce his dosage to 30mg and emphasized the importance of taking it daily, especially since he lost 10 pounds.

I was surprised Max stopped taking his medication without consulting Dr. Kwon. Vyvanse can impact appetite, weight, and heart health. Stopping
suddenly might contribute to afib. We should follow any Dr's recommendations and involve them in any decisions about Max’s treatment.
Let’s work together to keep Max on track and healthy.

Sorry. The first line is not about you. Natalie used a forked thread that presented a different picture of what actually happened when communicating
to Conner about Hong Kong.
I had said explicitly that I was not going to block the trip, but the fork made it appear like was doing that to “play games”. She said I was “playing
games” in three emails after that.
But I don’t want to fight. I have the email. It could have been a mistake. And it is not directed to you.
No gotchas. I’d like to smoke the peace pipe. Want to
give it a shot? We really were on a roll yesterday. Two days in a row. And the we had an unlucky spanner in the works (see what I did there? )

Court Order says no margin activity in the Jt Fidelity account.
Court order says only children's expenses from Bank of America account. Your personal expenses have removed over 5K which has dropped the

Your lawyer asked for my credit card balances as of June 12, by end of week, but has refused to share your balances. This should be excluding legal

I realize you did not sign in blood. But agreeing today and giving it serious thought is in itself still a commitment of great magnitude.
The fact that it happened after the week we had, in a sunny parking lot with church hymns singing in the background, was a sign of divinity.
My commitment to start the week:
- No flames  for any reason
- Write up and share Kari notes
- Write up and share Alan notes
- Tackle your Excel todo list
- Find and start DV classes
- Attend meeting with Jennifer
- Go to ADs hoops tryout
I’m sure there are more, but if you see something missing please just let me know. I assure you I will tackle it with speed and cooperation.
If we can even commit to giving each other a chance before handing it over to the lawyers, that alone is a huge victory for our kids & family.

Fidelity:
I think I can explain all of this, but if you did not get your half of the $400 Apple dividend, and I have the calc correct for the margin purchase, I
would owe you $3,874 to settle Fidelity.
BofA:
I think I stopped all auto-pays
- ATT
- Comcast
- Business Solver
- Power Bill
Then, I deposited $5,375 into the shared account that I think I owed back to the boys.
If that is not correct, please just let  me know and we can talk through any concerns. Between us please.
The next thing we need to tackle is how we get liquid in the Moyer accounts. And formally split them in terms of access and ownership.
It’s weird though, right? We will do this for us mentally and functionally, but we will still be viewed as a married couple when we file?

I don’t know Stephanie who lives 5 Minutes away. Or her daughter who is in charge of my kids. I just know what I saw yesterday was concerning.
We are on day two of having this person I didn’t even know existed, be in charge of my children. I assume it’s all good. I honestly trust you vetted her.
But yesterday you saw we crossed wires on both the drop off and then the pick up. Adrian kept asking to call her so we could figure out where she

Message 3810 of 4024
So... since you are not going to provide contact info, my ask is that AD goes to bed at a decent hour. He is always exhausted when he gets here and it
takes a while to warm up.
This may be even worse tomorrow if he has the freedom to stay up extra late playing Xbox because he has a sitter. I like him to be rested and ready for
the home visit Sat.
I hope you can understand why that is important.

We talked about this with Jennifer. I don’t want to spend half our time doing thumbs up or down.
Not an issue for now but let’s reach a friendly agreement on caretaking for our children. And help me understand why it is so important to keep her
contact info a secret from me. It just gives an odd appearance, right? Especially after yesterday.

I trusted you all week and we were a team. At least I was, even when you went dark (and I still didn’t bother you.) about it.
Why would you go in and block me as we try to turn the page to be nicer? What signal did you mean to send by doing that?
You had to take the time, knowing I am doing my best on every item on your todo list, and intentionally block me.
Why would you do that secretly? So now it’s back to the attorneys? We talked about all this. I thought I had your word.

Welcome back...
I hope it’s fair to ask the status of our kids supervision at this point since you are back on the grid. I feel like I was exceptionally patient given the
circumstances. And when you have a moment I’d love to know why it was essential to keep it all a big secret from me.
I’ll add that the one time I was able to reach the kids, it was a one minute phone call with AD. I asked about the sitter to be sure he had her number.
He got weird and immediately asked to get off the phone without answering. He said he would call back and never did.
I’d prefer to have a reasonable dialogue rather than test the expectations of the legal system at great monetary expense and further strain an already
toxic and counterproductive relationship. A week ago we agreed to strongly consider divorce counseling.

my "todo" list to demonstrate my intent. That is not meant to be an escalation. It's an effort to find peace with you.
- No flames  for any reason
- Write up and share Kari notes
- Write up and share Alan notes
- Tackle your Excel todo list
- Find and start DV classes
- Attend meeting with Jennifer
- Go to ADs hoops tryout
I agree to keep the tone friendly, but I also hope to move the ball forward for the kid's sake. May we consider meeting with Jennifer at least to discuss
the topic together? It can't hurt.

We should probably discuss the next visit if you have not. I think getting back to the “regular schedule” is a week off between you two.
I think in his mind, next weekend is the original schedule he is trying to get back on track for. I am not sure you have that in mind.
I think the two hour Conner Saturday visit was the exception to his regular schedule. Have you had any discussions or should we talk?

Hey-
This is not an escalation. As we discussed, it is a simple request to address outstanding issues without including the attorneys. But I don’t know what
you are expecting if you are not responsive. Please help me figure out how.
- On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's
been fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?
- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.
I have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.
- On 8/17, after asking several times about our Seahawks tickets, I tried to make some progress. Obviously, AD's decision to honor his wishes matter

here since we do every game together. I’m still waiting to hear back on this decision.
- On 8/18, I felt like we had a huge breakthrough. You expressed a willingness to consider divorce counseling for the kids under Jennifer’s guidance. I
have gone to great lengths to meet your every wish, but you still won’t confirm.
- On 8/23, you told me as you went off the grid that I could not have contact info for our kid's caretaker, despite mix-ups the prior day and an ER
visit with Max days before. You said we would discuss why, but still have not.
- On 8/28, I pointed out that you and Alan seem to be talking past each other about the “regular schedule.” We are less than two days away, and your
speed in responding to these questions worries me for the weekend.
On 8/28, I noted that the AAU hoops email was out and that we should have Adrian’s team assignment or at least a pointer to when we see his
schedule so we can plan. You have chosen not to reply to that mail at this time.
I have other issues also, like the kids in Macau w/o a release, Nanna’s upcoming visit, DV accusations during our ER visit, disregarding Dr Kwon, and
my SAAS involvement. But I am shouting into the abyss at this point.
We used to have our “running list” meetings, but this has been the pattern over the last six months since you ended them. May we please stop this and
sincerely work together without the attorneys? I really want us to heal.
There is no ill will or animosity on my part by sending this reminder. But I really don’t know how to try any harder to work peacefully with you to
resolve mutual issues if you don’t reply or take days to do so. Please help me help us.

If you remember the rest of the story, you remember when we sat at Driftwood. Their only regulars, at "our table". No limes in our soda water. Every
week w/o fail, we made it. We did whatever we had to do to be sure we had our regular date night. It was our reward and a special time for Mom and
Dad to kick off our "mini-vacation," as you would thank me each week.
We waited for the oysters to see what crazy thing the chef wanted to top them with. Then came the charcuterie, the bok choy, and a nice seabass or
pork chop if we felt brave. And we would chat. We talked about how great we were and how CRAZY Brian and Tomoko's husbands were. Who on
god's green earth would not sober up to see their own kids? 
They had to be supervised! That was crazy to us. It seemed as unimaginable as the first dates going on at the tables next to us. It was totally alien. Then
we would pay with Beth's gift certificate and laugh so hard you peed your pants on the way home to enjoy a White Lotus or Succession, followed by
the best part of the evening. We were happy—truly happy together.

So please take a moment to consider if I am one of those guys. With no demonstrated history of solo care? Not able to stop abusing? Was not a
coach or volunteer? Did not play Uber for all the kids' friends? No ongoing program to assure their sobriety, And no sterling history of supervised
visits for six months since this started without even a hiccup along the way. I'm not them. 
But please, with that in mind, check out the custody table attached. Take a look at the splits. Look where they landed, and then look at me. I am at
1.5% vs. 98.5%. I'm not going to start a fight. I am not pushing for anything more than our agreement to see Jennifer made today. That is a miracle.

This has come at expense of and sacrificing,  stopping monthly kids college contributions, potentially moving them back to public school, and change

Obviously you knew about the other unvested RSU account which is clearly not in the x9039 as I disclosed it in the discovery. I don’t have access to
those shares until they vest. They would never vest if I left SBUX. Some were granted before the divorce filing and some after.
Agree post divorce shares granted and vesting will be deposited into account 9039. I will move those out immediately so need to adjust the language in
the stipulation.
Yes we can memorialize everything including your spend from the jt BofA account and fidelity account in violation of the order.
I still have not seen statements from June July and Aug from msft fidelity account.
Based on this tone and accusations I no longer feel comfortable with assuming you will repay me the 3.7k that you used in violation or other

So... I made a minor correction noted with track changes, a simple “his” vs “her” thing.  See attached.  Other than that, we are mostly good to go
except for the questions below.
With regard to your x9039 account, are you leaving the amount in the first exhibit like we discussed (governed by the freeze order) but moving the
remainder of the stock in the second exhibit?  I am not sure I understood that you had another 46k in RSUs just sitting around in that account you
had created before the mediation. I thought you just had the 10k in Sbux stock you disclosed yesterday that were “easy to track.” If your RSUs were
granted during our marriage, they are generally considered marital property and are subject to division. Were you going to mention those? I think that
would be the same as stock and we would not want to co-mingle that with the predistribution. But this is all news to me anyway. Just let me know.
Also, do we want to insert amounts transferred into the stipulation so we can memorialize the predistributions?

I asked for a simple clarification. One that you admitted would require an update now. So in pointing that out to you, and even as you acknowledge
that we need to update the stipulation, you go back on your word and say I made accusations.
I would prefer we walk this back. If you insist on going nuclear for asking about a correction that needs to be made I don’t understand. It feels like an
overreaction and misdirection by you to a mistake that I identified and you agreed to change.

"Sat Aug 24 or Sunday Aug 25 - To confirm date (This gets us back on regular schedule)"
Did Alan ever agree that this was the regular schedule, or were you just telling me it was? We both knew Alan was only available to accommodate
Conner.
I was grateful, but 90 minutes was NOT a visit. Given the earliest I see AD is the middle of Sept. I'm trying to figure out how we can communicate
better.
Please work with me because the math this summer works out like this:
- I got 7.3 visits in total or 43 hours over 120 days this summer.
- That is about 2.5 hours/week and/or about 10.75 hours/month.
- Hours with Dad vs. hours with Mom work out to be 43 vs. 2,837
- You had every holiday, international trip, and the month of July
- Legally speaking, custody sits as 1.5% with Me vs. 98.5% with you
- The missing 5.5 hours on Sat is actually 13% of my whole summer
- By comparison, that 13% would be like you losing  a full 16 days
Do you still need me to ask Jennifer to verify what Adrian said, or will you do that? And if she does, will it even matter to you? I don't want to put
him in the middle again if it doesn't.

So tonight you have my money, my house, my kids, my life. You even got money that should still be frozen by all accounts. And I don’t merit your

I am just curious if you are ever going to make a reasonable attempt to work together for the kids. Would anything get you to try to co-parent?

That's a hell of a long time to be gone,.
It’s none of my business what you are doing in your personal life, but I have to ask if those plans impact my ability to see my son and if you are
introducing new partners to my kids now.
It just seems crazy that we couldn’t squeeze in six hours over four days instead of having to go three full weeks between visits, especially since the last
visit was 90 minutes with Conner.
Please note from August 17 and his next visit on September 13, we will be averaging 90 minutes over 28 days or 0.22% of his total available time. This
is an average of about 3 minutes a day.

- I'm not asking where you are. Who are Max and Adrian under the care of now?
- Are you really spending all Friday through Monday out of town with him?
- I have to ask if theses plans impact my ability to see my son
You drive to Whistler for an overnight. But 90 minutes so I could see him is too much?
I could have come to you. You realize I took both kids and all their friends there last year.
Since you won't budge, even on a holiday weekend, between August 25th - September 14th
• My time with Adrian averages out to 0.5 hours per week and approximately 2.16 hours per
  month for this period.
• During this period, the hours spent with me are 1.5 hours, while the hours spent with you are
  approximately 502.5 hours.
• The legal custody split over this time period is approximately 0.30% with me versus 99.70%
  with you so I have to note.
I am effectively down to zero custody even after your July. Seems crazy this is what you want.

There was not a plan for Adrian to see you this weekend. I shared earlier this week Adrian’s friends invited us to join them at their cabin. It would be
strange if you showed up and I’m not comfortable with you joining us.
This feels like an escalation.

There was not a plan because you ignored the fact that you and Alan were not coordinating. I saw it coming a mile away and said so.
So instead of coming up with a solution so Adrian could spend at least a few hours during the four day holiday you keep saying you have plans.
Make Adrian having a father a priority. Our custody split is 99.7 vs .30. This is on your watch of your doing. You own his whole schedule.
BTW- it’s pretty crappy you blackballed me with all of our 15 year friends, and now as he makes new ones I have no place there either. Thanks.
Do you ever step back and think about the destruction you are causing? You make it “strange” for Adrian to have a father... why do that?
As you refuse to let me see my kids and diminish any opportunity for me to be a good parent who can involve his friends, this is an escalation.
4th try- can you answer the questions I keep retyping?

I'm not interested in going back and forth when you intentionally don't answer my questions below, make zero effort to let me see my son over a long
holiday weekend, and are willing to create ill will by saying it would be "strange" for AD's father to be around him or you.
I can't even imagine the picture you painted of me to make that so forbidden. But that's what you did with our Cabo Crew. I don't get you, and I
can't understand why you would make the kids feel hate and shame for 50% of who they are. You really changed, Christine.
But I do know nothing ever changes your mind, so I'm done. Hope you find peace in this new life you have created ...

Adrian was not scheduled for this weekend.
We should align on how to schedule Alan moving forward in a way that does not cause conflict or confrontation.
October is going to be tricky.
Alan can’t do Oct 5 or Oct 6 when your mom is in town.
I’m taking boys to do college tours weekend of Oct 12/13. I’d like to keep those dates if possible. Let me know if that will be an issue.
You are gone Oct 19 and 26. I’ll let you propose make up dates.
We have evening activities planned so can come back to this tomorrow.

You let him go off his Rx that I was very diligent about discussing it with Dr. Kwan, and you knew he was not to do that without discussing it. He
ended up in the ER after this unilateral decision.

Let me know if you disagree with anything. Happy to work with you to resolve.
- On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's
been fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?
<<9/3 Update: You said you would not honor his wishes and denied he said it, putting him in the middle. You asked that I get Jennifer to tell you
what he said.>>
- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.
I have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.
<<9/3 Update: Blocked on you. You said you were ready to sign but keep changing the doc. You promised to resolve on Mon. It's Tue and we are
going backward>>

<<9/3 Update: You said you would not honor his wishes and denied he ever said it. He asked for this before Hong Kong>>
- On 8/18, I felt like we had a huge breakthrough. You expressed a willingness to consider divorce counseling for the kids under Jennifer’s guidance. I
have gone to great lengths to meet your every wish, but you still won’t confirm.
<<9/3 Update: We, appropriately enough, have a meeting with Jennifer on 9/11. I hope that she can help us move forward peacefully>>
- On 8/23, you told me as you went off the grid that I could not have contact info for our kid's caretaker, despite mix-ups the prior day and an ER
visit with Max days before. You said we would discuss why, but still have not.
<<9/3 Update: Still no response. You did the same thing again this weekend when I asked for information and you refused. I still don't know who
watched my kids>>
- On 8/28, I pointed out that you and Alan seem to be talking past each other about the “regular schedule.” We are less than two days away, and your
speed in responding to these questions worries me for the weekend.
<<9/3 Update: I did not get to see AD and you let me know I will go 28 days between my supervised visits with the next landing on 9/13.>>
- I have other issues also, like the kids in Macau w/o a release, Nanna’s upcoming visit, DV accusations during our ER visit, disregarding Dr Kwon,
and my SAAS involvement. But I am shouting into the abyss at this point.

you were simply dark on my requests for cooperation. Can you imagine if you had actually chosen to respond on the date you noted as highs below?
- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.
I have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.
<<9/3 Update: Blocked on you. You said you were ready to sign but keep changing the doc. You promised to resolve on Mon. It's Tue and we are

It taught me a lot, however, about the value of your commitments, even when validated by your attorney. You don't honor them. The mediator
agreed you should, so I got what you had promised. Having him point out the obvious seems like a huge waste of time and money to me.
All of this is the official record so no need to debate it...

After ignoring my request to discuss for the last two weeks, are you telling me my choice?
- On 8/17, after asking several times about our Seahawks tickets, I tried to make some progress. Obviously, AD's decision to honor his wishes matters
here since we do every game together. I’m still waiting to hear back on this decision.
We need a better way to resolve issues. It seems like the pattern is you ignore things - Fidelity, visitation, Seahawks, Alan, etc.- then tell me your
decision. How can we cooperate so I am involved more in the "answer" side of the equation and not always only on the "question" side?
As noted in my update today, I am really trying to work with you peacefully and cooperatively. But tonight, you are just telling me what you are
doing with everything you control. You literally have my kids, my money, my house, and continuing to add to it today, my life's calendar.
I think the cherry on top is giving AD a vote to skip his Nanna's 80th birthday after she flies across the country at that age to be with him. Some things
kids don't get a vote on, Christine.
BTW- I am done with this for the night. When you send control messages that reinforce that you own every aspect of my life, it gives me severe
anxiety and is not good for my mental health. I'm really breaking at this point. Hope we can try again, and you will loosen the reins on me a bit.

I offered to work with you. I even went as far as to say that I would stop this track, attend counseling with you, and begin a collaborative divorce

This is as you have always said. We always agreed to let professionals decide, but this feels like control to me since you have cut off all contact with my
kids. I don't think we can collaborate if we start from a place where you are coercing me to acquiesce to DV claims to see my kids.
That is not how a healthy divorce is supposed to work. I want to continue the conversation without the coercion and control. We can have a
professional guide us through it. But this feels like , along with the finance piece, just committing DV against me.  You see that right?

I never said it was because he stopped it. I said I did not know. This is just like when you said I called you a liar today but said, "I was unaware." This
stuff is all written down, Christine.
On the night of the ER visit, I complained that you unilaterally decided against Dr. Kwan's orders to discontinue his medication without telling him.
This bothered me because when we had just seen Dr. Kwan, you both noted Max was taking it on and off and had dropped 8 lbs. We all worked on a
plan. You adjusted his Vyvanse to 30 mg from 40mg, agreed he would take it daily, and had a small meal before bed.
I was expressing my concern about your disregard for Dr Kwan's orders. And it would be reasonable to ask the question at least if it could have been a
part of the reason we were there.  You have said it was not after taking to him. That is good news for everyone. But I would also ask that when we have
clear orders from a Doctor, we follow them or let them know that you plan to try something else. I hope that is reasonable.

Can we sort this out? I don't want to fight over misunderstandings. Either you will let me see AD or not, share caregiver info or not, sign fidelity
papers or not, or require the DV box to be ticked or not. But this back-and-forth is pointless and has become counterproductive at this point.
Before we go to Jennifer, let's make a list of things we seem to disagree on and whether we actually believe them and can stand by them. Then, by

super simple. No hearsay, just a plain statement of facts and our point of view.  It's the most honest thing we can do together.
Of course, it binds us to our word, but it should. We should be honest and collectively stand by what we say to whoever asks. Not a different story to
every person, across any medium, on any given day. Let's share the doc, *track the changes*, and be accountable for our actions.
I have no issue standing by my statements. I assume you feel the same way. Can we try that?
Message 3970 of 4024
Let’s wrap this up.
You say Adrian did not want the meeting with me and that he did not say that he would feel safe at a Seahawks game alone with me if I blew on the
SoberLink before, during, and after.
We disagree. I think he wanted to have the meeting with me, we discussed it. I also know that he said what I reported in both meetings: We have
witnesses. How do we get to the bottom of this?
btw- if I used incorrect syntax, I am totally ok with your corrections. I believe the spirt of my statement is accurate though. But let’s ask Jennifer and
decide. That’s what she is here for, right?
That’s one thing off our list!

You have decided to ignore important things and cause fear and control me, even after I told you.
If you want to work together please be constructive and answear the questions instead of threatening me.

You know I will answear because you said I was bugging your phone in December. But I wasn’t I get alerts. And despite that, you do it every time to
control me and show me you can refuse to cooperate on anything constructively.
You did it last week when you went out of town without Fidelity solved costing me over 20k, refused to say who was watching Max, and violating our
signed residential agreement. I won’t see AD for 28 days between visits now at best.
You do this to torment me. You know that you have caused extreme anxiety and the loss I feel from you alienating our kids and disparaging me to all

street tacos...
We used to say “ego amo te” to each other every day. It’s Latin for “I love you.” It was our special thing. We don’t do that now. It’s days since we
talked. He was “mini me “ as you called him. We had a bond so strong in Dec that Dr Brown repeatedly called it out as a possible issue. We were “too
close” she said.
We went to Cabo on our own, multiple times. You like to say on one night he thought I was drunk. That’s what you say. But we got our wires crossed
during the national championship game and could not find each other for a few minutes. And he has never been right when he thought I was drunk
since this started.
You put him in the middle of every single situation and use him as a pawn to execute your personal vendetta, pissed off the “perfect mom” was
discovered having an affair with a married man that worked for her. But you will do anything in your power to keep that squeaky clean image fresh.
You and I both know the truth. We both acknowledge that when you and Lillian (who made me her mule to secretly smuggle spores into Canada)
decided this, I was the best Dad and Husband ever. We both remember the conversation in the kitchen where you said it and Max overhead, loudly
agreeing with you.
But you decided that instead of a kind divorce like we agreed to, and nesting as we said, you would destroy me. Take everything from me. Wife, kids,
home, money, friends, freedom, future in your crusade to make me the second biological father you stripped of his own children. Even using the same
playbook.
The funny thing about this all is that I always said we had a busted system. We needed help. But you have put the singular blame on me. Never seeing
a good day in 30 years together. That’s crazy btw. But since, your harassment and personal destruction has only proven the kind of person you are.
Always were.
And even though I was an amazing Dad and husband in 2023, you deny it. And even though all evidence points toward both my ongoing sobriety for
a year now, and many months of positive trip reports, you cling to a past to show I never changed so you can justify taking my kids. You simple ignore
reality.
But it’s all there. Tests, shots, Alan’s reports. Even if I was the only problem and you are blameless for events years ago, you can’t deny what I am now.
And have been. Yet you have still chosen to destroy the kids relationship with me. Taken their father away. And control my kids, my money, my
home, my future.
Let’s see what today holds.... more ’s for me instead of trying to work together and actually answering questions that help us move forward in a
constructive way. More “I wish you well, Robert’s” as you violate the residential plan and keep the kids caregiver information from me. It never
ends....

It was nice being there with you tonight. Together as their parents. SAAS is a safe zone. If we just designated anything to do with our kids as a "safe
zone" with the same "no shop talk" rules, we would be a much healthier family. We could literally open any door if we followed that simple rule.
Our "rock quantitative/qualitative" exercise also felt good. Someone else was leading the class, and you and I had instructions. If we extend the same
rule as above, we really could glass blow, cooking class, whatever. It's a baby step, but if we find humanity in each other again it's a game changer.
I actually think it is WAY SAFER than therapy or cofeve. Let's start by being human to each other.

But,  at a minimum, we still have not even figured out the Seahawks, or if I can see AD, so it's not a full month between our visits. I don't want to

I gotta really figure out another way to ask you how we resolve parenting issues and work together. It’s the one thing that we will have to do for years

Even after last night for 2.5 hours, elbow to elbow for 8 classes and a lab, where no one in that entire school would have thought we were not normal
husband and wife without a care in the world. It feels like we never let ourselves take the win and improve.
I want to offer suggestions to consider, but after a year, I’m out of those too. And you won’t see anyone to even get help. It is literally a Gordon knot.
It’s unsolvable. I assume you want to try??? But actually feel the need for you to confirm that first.
Do you want to do anything to improve our relationship to co-parent and get past this bullshit “parallel parenting” justification to never cooperate.

You sent a couple of emails with statements that lead me to believe you missed this. Was that the case?

We know we can do it, and I mean what I said to start the thread more than ever 
Thursday, we did well and enjoyed ourselves. Do you want to ride this success and continue to develop a more positive f2f rapport in the kid's best
interest? There are so many opportunities.
Let's find an excuse to work together as co-parents! We both look better in the end so we cancel each other out ... lol

I would like to cooperate and move things forward. I see no benefit when it results in anger, disruption and accusations. Looking forward to helpful
suggestions to keep the tone down.

I didn’t see any movement to moved forward. If you want a game I picked let me know.

This is the updated two week calendar.
Alan indicated to me, he communicated with you that he could not do Oct 26. You may be in Cabo so would have missed this date either way.
I had shared with you I had a conflict for Oct 12 and asked for an adjustment. I didn’t see a response so I’m adjusting on my end and Adrian will be
there.
Note Oct 5/6 is not covered.

I sent the schedule for Alan that I am aware of.
Seahawks - I sent my picks. Happy to swap if you feel strongly about a particular game, or want to buy me out. Please let me know any proposed
changes by end of week.
Thank you for preparing the letter to Fidelity. I can e-sign after reviews are finalized.

You told me that you scheduled to have Max and Adrian out of town *again* and would prefer not to change that.
I think the highest-order bit is the residential plan. So we need to accommodate that first, rather than an after-the-fact.
Do we agree?

As I noted, I'd like to discuss this. We have the tickets for AD and me, which you are blocking. This is not a great mystery. Let's have the discussion,
please.

I have replied to both of your forked topics now since we did not get to discuss after you went dark
