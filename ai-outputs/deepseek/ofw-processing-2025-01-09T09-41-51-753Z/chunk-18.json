I’ll take him after the game tomorrow for a few hours. If have at least 24 hours it will help us all. Thanks for thinking of the two of us.\nPer below, should we discuss with Dr Brown so we make some progress and create some allowances before this screeches to a halt with Phase I?\nSent:03/01/2024 at 06:37 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 08:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nMessage 1780 of 4024\nPlease get some ice on his arm.

We sat and talked for a while but he’s not great. The guy has no base. No stability. So everything seems bigger than\nit needs to be. That’s my opinion anyway. I know we are both on board together to do the right thing.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 07:28 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 08:09 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\n\nAlso! I know I’ll have him for a bit after the game (6:00? Drop off) but I never heard back in how I can help. Please don’t be too proud. Let me\nshoulder some burden to let you catch your breath!\nNo harm in that!\nMessage 1782 of 4024\nI agree. We have a very different perspective on how we got here.\nI’m doing and have done what I believed to be in best interest of boys and will continue to do so.\nSent:03/01/2024 at 08:12 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/01/2024 at 08:22 PM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1783 of 4024\nNot to argue but perhaps we do as Dr Brown said, “disagree on the past, focus on the future”\nAgree, this has all been your plan. I have no influence at all. Do you think it’s going pretty well so far?\nNot fighting, just suggesting some reflection. I think both things could be thoughtfully considered.\nHope this lands in the spirit it is intended which is child focused solutions for their mental health.\nI’m not expecting a debate. I was not even expecting a response. I said “we are both on board together”.\nThanks!\nSent:03/01/2024 at 08:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:08 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1784 of 4024\nHey- If you could let me know the answer to at least the Sonos questions tomorrow it would be great. Ideally I could get the sub from the computer\ncloset after or at the game. It’s still in its box I think. It’s heavy though, so I do not mind grabbing it myself under your close supervision. I’m just\nblocked again trying to rebuild stuff. I really appreciate it.

Once I understood I pulled out what was not needed to make space.\nFor the Sonos I just snipped the black tie that held it in.no damage was done prior to removal.\nI pulled all Sonos speakers I was aware with exception of one in the porch mailbox. It would not open. I’ll look for speaker in computer closet and\nbring it if I can locate it.\nIf you want any of old computers to start breaking them down just let me know\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:24 AM)\nSubject:Re: Hardware Questions <not urgent>\n\nMessage 1789 of 4024\nYes but we can’t sweep things under rug in regards to impact.\nFocus on future does not mean ignore that and you get clean slate.,\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:25 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:32 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1790 of 4024\nDo you know if they win and what options are?\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:30 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS boys state tournament\nMessage 1791 of 4024\nI am sorry you interpreted that as surveillance. I hope they explained my explanation to you so you know it was accurate. Perhaps hire an IT\nprofessional if you still have concerns. I know what happened, can show you live in front of your eyes, you see the same behavior yourself, and have\nsent me the\nOriginal cams you thought did not exist.\nSure... whatever was done broke the bridge. I have been at it for three days and am still working on it now.\nI think there are two on the fireplace porch.

Forgive, don’t forget.\nThe problem is, your whole focus is on retribution. You want to punish me at great expense to the children’s mental health and our relationship.\nI was on a path towards solving the problem as you had asked already. We saw that. It was slow but tracking. You took a different path as iyour\nchoice.\nBut perhaps you should ask yourself if you and the kids are better today than on June 30. Was this really the way to do this? Even if we were getting a\ndivorce.\nPerhaps in our discussion with Dr. Brown it would actually be beneficial for us both to understand the role of punishment and creating a successful\nfuture\nSent:03/02/2024 at 08:35 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 08:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Drop Off\nMessage 1794 of 4024\nWe have a few outstanding issues we are discussing but you tend to fire off a response and then go dark for 4-12 hours instead of responding. This gets\nfrustrating and creates tension as a result because I don’t get to see my kids or solve issues in a timely manner. I don’t think it’s how you would handle\nan ask from Julie, but that’s your choice.\nBut please understand this is an example that I consider to be poking at me, intentionally making our relationship difficult by refusing to move things\nforward, that keeps me sitting on my hands or missing time with my children. This is not an unfounded criticism. It’s born out of months of\nbehavior. It would also frustrate Julie I’m sure.\nI tried to be very kind yesterday. I recognized you needed space and help. I tried to do that and my offer still stands today. I don’t harbor any ill will.\nBut it makes things hard when you are intentionally counterproductive with most every OFW problem solving interaction.\nYou are smart enough to realize you do this and then tell me you want to see a change. Catch-22, Chinese finger trap, or like they say “the beatings will\ncontinue till morale improves”. It weaponizes what it is supposed to be a safe platform for communication by making it a power play.\nIf this is the only way you will communicate, perhaps step back and understand the damage it does from a neutral perspective. Or we can ask Dr\nBrown. Either way, it goes back to the original issue which is you refuse any professional recommendations to improve our communications.\nJust something to consider as it goes from bad to worse. I’ll save yet another “definition of insanity” quote. You clearly either don’t understand what\nyou were saying for years or are intentionally doing it with malice and forethought. What would you suggest to have constructive communications?\nI’m all ears...\nSent:03/02/2024 at 09:02 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 09:25 AM)\nSubject:Are you done?",
