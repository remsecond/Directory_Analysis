Any insight there since\nyou are the single source of information?\nAnd please, please do not go after him again like you did vacationing in California, and talked to me. For that matter, I’d rather not know than I\nwould want to put that boy in the middle of our mess even more.\nJust trying to effectively coparent in a very awkward situation..thanks!\nSent:04/05/2024 at 09:18 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/06/2024 at 08:50 AM)\nSubject:Re: Spring break\nMessage 2378 of 4024\nI’m struggling with why you won’t answer that question, Christine. Why wont you work together on what we’re telling the kids? We should not\ndisparage each other to them, right?\nThat has been advised since the first court video we watched “What about the Kids” and with every therapists since. So please don’t keep your “Dad\nnarrative” top-secret?\nAs mentioned, I feel like there has been a steady drumbeat of parental alienation since this all started. And, yes, that’s just my own POV. But it’s these\nthings that fuel those concerns.\nI know that is not your intent. I know we both only want the best for them. So please help me, help our kids, so we leave them out of adult business\nthey should be insulated from.\nLooking forward to your feedback as your coparent.\nSent:04/06/2024 at 11:37 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/06/2024 at 05:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spring break\nMessage 2379 of 4024\nThe kids were told we would pivot and look at alternatives.\nIt appears you spoke to Adrian. Asked I don’t verify what you are saying he said.\nI am looking at options in the US for Spring Break. Adrian will not attend the game tomorrow night.\nThe Cabo number below works. I called yesterday and was informed you had just called and cancelled the April 6 week, and was told it’s still available\nto use for another week.\nI cancelled April 13, which is still available for use.\nSent:04/06/2024 at 05:11 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 04/06/2024 at 05:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spring break\n\nMessage 2380 of 4024\nOf course, I spoke to Adrian. I was walking him to the car, and that is when he discussed not being able to go on Spring Break like all of his friends.\nThat is when I got the impression it was portrayed as \"my fault\". If it was not, great. All I can do is trust you, and I appreciate the partnership in their\nbest interest. Thank you.\nI worry when you say things like this: \"Asked I don’t verify what you are saying he said.\". I feel like Divorce 101 is not putting your kids in the middle\nof your crap. I gave the example of when you brought him into our business In Cali and how awful that was for his psyche.\nIn our final visit, Dr. Brown noted that I needed to \"take one for the team\" and not explain what happened with the cam to him. I did, and I have\nnever brought it up since. As I have said, the kids are not supposed to be a part of this. It is our business and our fault.\nSo, getting them to \"verify\" statements for you to triangulate is a horrifying thought. Please don't make me ask you not to put them in the middle. If\nwe disagree, can we at least sidebar with someone ASAP? If we disagree there, it is a big problem.\nPlease see the attached for the warnings I sent in Jan. This is not a mystery. I  saw this a mile away, told you about it, and asked to partner, but you\ninsisted on your plan instead of professional recommendations. I really wish we had worked together back then.\nI am also unsure why you would cancel Cabo. I asked for two dinners—three total hours at most over a full week. I was going to stay far away and not\nsee you. I don't get why taking away the entire vacation I take AD to every year, with you guys joining later, is good parenting..\nIt honestly feels like you would do anything to them to punish me. I hope that is not true.\nI would still like to see them as requested. That has not changed, so please let me know.\nThe number did not work. See attached. You can see multiple failed calls. Please don't try so hard to be \"correct\" on everything that you feel the need\nto point out that someone in the tech industry for 30 years can't recognize when a phone number does not work. That doesn't make sense.\nBut I finally got through when I called the lady who I worked with on the \"30-person weeks\" you booked for someone else during the prime season\nafter saying I had them this year. I'd love to understand what the heck that is and what we got in exchange so I can use it, too. Just let me know what's\nup. honestly, please\nAnd so what was April the 13th? Is that the other Presidential at Grand Sol Mar? Please don't tell me that you had that during prime time and just\ncanceled it w/o offering it to me after you said I had it this year and next. I was on the phone with them last week to figure out how to get into Sol\nMar, and it's obviously impossible to do.\nSo if we had that, given you know what that means to me, and just killed it, that is an extraordinarily vengeful and malicious thing to do. Doing\nnothing would have been easier and I would have loved it. But you purposely went out of your way not to let me have something nice.\nThis whole thing is so far out of hand now, Christine. I would love to find a way to peacefully uncouple and help the kids. They don't want us to hate\neach other. Can we just start playing nicely together? I'm not asking to be friends, but let's please partner to co-parent. We don't have to hate and\nwant to destroy one another. There is a better way that we won't regret for years to come. Please consider it.\nQ's:\n- Can I see our children over their spring break?\n- Can you explain the confusion on the Time Share?\nSent:04/06/2024 at 06:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/06/2024 at 11:56 PM)\nSubject:Re: Spring break\nAttachments:911_AD_Needs_Help.pdf (74 KB)\nAD_Text_1.jpg (85 KB)\nimage_123650291.JPG (377 KB)\n\n- Any way we can pause and partner for the kids?\nAttachments:\n- Plea to you back in Jan dialing 911 for AD's mental health\n- Text of him blaming himself because he is in the middle\n- Call log of the Grand Sol Mar phone # not going through.\nI really would do anything to try and get this on the rails and give them the childhood they deserve before we steal even more than we have.

It is still available to use this year, and you need to\nrebook subject to availability.

And now I\nam increasingly more inclined to look at the past through your eyes. You were sober and wanted the best for the family, us, and frankly me most of all.\nYou did your level best and I am forever grateful to you for that.\nI may have been angry at the way things went down, and not getting the chance to continue our positive trajectory, but that’s my problem. Not\nyours. All I saw was that our life finally seemed happy to me. I was finally making in roads with Max, AD and I were peas in a pod. And you and I, i\nhad never in our entire 30 years been happier or more hopeful.\nBut you had a change of heart. It was too late. I missed the last train leaving the station and you and the kids were on it . That’s not your fault. I was\nthe one who got drunk and lost my ticket. You did all you could to be sure I’d make it. I can be bitter and point fingers but we both were there. We\nboth know who is at fault. It was me and I have to accept that.\nSo... if I am weaponizing this thread, I guess I have some splaining to do, because this is not exactly a ringing endorsement for me...\nAttached is what I see for the beavers.\nI think you are good. Hope you are having fun.\nMessage 2427 of 4024\nSooo.... It was a contentious call and we needed to go toe to toe on some things we disagree on but the gold is mined when we realize that nothing\nconstructive will come from those arguments.\nI own what I did, you own what you did. We can both share immutable facts and color them with our own narrative. The question is if there is more\nharm than good that comes from that public declaration.\nCorrelation is not causation. But someone else (Conner) will decide if it’s more than correlation and if one of us is truly at fault for the difference in\nour family today vs the last day in June.\nSo I’m not really interested in assigning blame. I want the problem fixed. I want to get our kids back on track, including a relationship with me that\nany court will want to see a path to as healthy.\nI’m not saying we have to be friends, I am asking that for our kids parents that we appear to be. We need to start behaving normal. Going on like this\nis counterproductive and unhealthy.\nSo you said you would think about it. On the plus side you say you will give it some consideration. On the negative side, you say that every time. So I\nhave to temper my hopes for a better future.\nI can suggest a process and perhaps some tangible next steps or deliverables so we partner instead of plaster each other. It’s not going to be easy, but\nthe alternative is likely far worse and public.\nI will be reasonable in waiting on your decision within reason. I’ve sent this same note too many times to be strung along without results again. The\nCharlie Brown & Lucy metaphor just falls flat now.\nSo I’d like to know your thoughts. If you have changed your mind, just let me know and we can man our battle stations. But I hope you see I’m trying\nto do right by you as you deserve.\nSent:04/12/2024 at 04:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/12/2024 at 06:30 PM)\nSubject:Progress...\n\nPlease advise...\nThanks\n-robert\nMessage 2428 of 4024\nI’ll call when I find it..\nSent:04/12/2024 at 06:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/12/2024 at 06:30 PM)\nSubject:I’m trying\nAttachments:IMG_2629.jpg (10 MB)\nMessage 2429 of 4024\nSo you don’t look at OFW and you don’t answer calls as agreed.

The way I read this is that all relevant emails and texts that pertain to the parenting issues being evaluated would be\nconsidered important documents to be turned over as part of the evaluation process. Just my take.\nConnor is looking for comprehensive information to assess our situation. So any communications that provide insight into our parenting dynamics,\ndecisions, and interactions are relevant. Based on what you shared last week, I assume you agree.\nSo my ask is that since all of this is going to be publicly available, is if it was worth it to establish scope & subjects that are or are not relevant. That’s all.\nI’m not doing anything nefarious. If you agree, I’d love to work together and not blow each other.\nObviously we need to ask our attorneys if this is a correct interpretation.

Once the agreement is incorporated into the final divorce decree and the divorce is finalized by the\ncourt, the division of property as agreed upon in mediation is then legally effective and binding.\nSo, while parties may agree upon the division of community property during mediation, this division doesn’t go into effect until the divorce is\nofficially granted by the court and the agreement is entered into the court order. It’s also important for individuals to follow the specific court orders\nand local rules, as procedural requirements may vary. Consulting with a legal professional familiar with Washington state divorce law would provide\nthe most accurate guidance for an individual’s specific situation.\nSent:04/14/2024 at 01:11 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/14/2024 at 02:06 PM)\nSubject:Community Property\nMessage 2470 of 4024\n?\nSent:04/14/2024 at 01:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/14/2024 at 02:04 PM)\nSubject:Password\nAttachments:IMG_2643.JPG (3 MB)",
