Other than that, we are mostly good to go\nexcept for the questions below.\nWith regard to your x9039 account, are you leaving the amount in the first exhibit like we discussed (governed by the freeze order) but moving the\nremainder of the stock in the second exhibit?  I am not sure I understood that you had another 46k in RSUs just sitting around in that account you\nhad created before the mediation. I thought you just had the 10k in Sbux stock you disclosed yesterday that were “easy to track.” If your RSUs were\ngranted during our marriage, they are generally considered marital property and are subject to division. Were you going to mention those? I think that\nwould be the same as stock and we would not want to co-mingle that with the predistribution. But this is all news to me anyway.

So in pointing that out to you, and even as you acknowledge\nthat we need to update the stipulation, you go back on your word and say I made accusations.\nI would prefer we walk this back.

Happy to work with you to resolve.\n- On 7/10, Adrian requested a Karin meeting to share his wishes. On 8/18 and 8/21, we confirmed Adrain feels safe seeing me solo when I blow. It's\nbeen fifty-three days since AD's request. When will we honor those?\n<<9/3 Update: You said you would not honor his wishes and denied he said it, putting him in the middle. You asked that I get Jennifer to tell you\nwhat he said.>>\n- On 7/15, I offered a way to comply with our court order. You never replied. On 8/05, despite our order, you took ~$400k in stock and $15k in cash.\nI have been working since to try to fix it, but we are still dead in the water.\n<<9/3 Update: Blocked on you.

I want to continue the conversation without the coercion and control. We can have a\nprofessional guide us through it. But this feels like , along with the finance piece, just committing DV against me.  You see that right?\nSent:09/04/2024 at 12:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 01:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: May we Please Finish?\nMessage 3944 of 4024\nTo make peace, I signed your version.\nSent:09/04/2024 at 12:49 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 01:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Doc\n\nMessage 3945 of 4024\nSounds good.

I asked you to quote me, and you read every word I said, and it simply\nread, \"I was unaware.\" There was nothing even close to me calling you a liar.\nIf my interpretation is incorrect or I used incorrect syntax, please correct. You definitely said AD did not want the meeting. Since Jennifer and Kari\nmade him do the meeting against his wishes, let's address this with them.\nSent:09/04/2024 at 02:41 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: Email- Kari\n\nYou need to be able to stand by what you say in front of other people if it impacts Adrian. This is a straightforward ask. You said he did not say he\nwould feel safe with SoberLink and he never wanted the meetings. Is that true?\nMessage 3950 of 4024\nI write things down because the moment you say them and play them back, you deny them.\nPlease correct below if you did not demand that I tick 3a and agree to a DV parenting plan.\nOr even confirm you didn't say it, and we agree that 3a is not a demand you expect of me.\nYou have demanded it for months and kept my kids from me as a result.  Let's put it to bed.\n3a or no 3a?\nSent:09/04/2024 at 02:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: May we Please Finish?\nMessage 3951 of 4024\nI have requested that we subpoena the tape as you asked. I hope it gives us peace and allows us to both use it to help us understand what DV is and is\nnot. We will finally have a witness after years of accusations. It can be a teaching moment for us both.\nSent:09/04/2024 at 03:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:ER Night DV Accusation\nMessage 3952 of 4024\nToday we had a moment to discuss the weekend. Specifically around why would not tell me, for the second week in a row, who was watching my\nkids.\nYou had AD and you explained you would be sleeping with the parents of his friends, who invited you but not me. And you would not tell me about\nMax.\nWhen we disagreed on my right to know, you explained that I have been stalking and harassing their caregivers so I had no right to this info.\nI asked when I had done this but you had no Answear. But I can’t even recall the last time they had overnight care, much less stalking or harassing\nanyone.\nThis is false accusation and you have no proof of the behavior. And not permitting me to know who or where my kids are feels malicious and uncalled\nfor.\nSent:09/04/2024 at 04:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 09/04/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:Stalking and Harassment of Cargivers",
