  "text": "[Section: Page 414 of 1048]\n\n\n\nThe irreparable harm done over the last seven weeks is devastating. It has literally torn the Moyer family apart and cast reputations asunder. Just think\nabout if we had done this the next day, instead of now, given the result and recommendations. There is a lesson to be learned.\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied\" and we both got the justice we wanted so would you like to discuss next steps, or should I assume we are back into\nthe plan as recommended as a stopgap till the attorneys do their thing? Just let me know if you want to discuss here or by phone.\nWe both have crazy bitterness for the way this transpired, festered, and destroyed us as a family, just to end up here. Even though she was crazy hard\non me today, it is clear that if nothing changed except for fostering hate and distrust for a month and a half, we missed the mark.\nGiven we are both parents forever (co? parallel? fuck all?) to our kids, I hope we refer to her thoughtful words as we make decisions and consider their\nbest interests moving forward. What a total fucked up goat rodeo this was and the relationships it destroyed for me, are very real.\nPlease let me know if you are going to make time. I assure you I'll be peaceful and constructive.\n-robert\nMessage 1578 of 4024\nYou know we got Dr. Brown’s parenting plan back yesterday. Afterwards you checked out and I assume I won’t hear back from you till you get\naround to it in the morning. You can make up any excuse that you want, but you got exactly what you asked for and now you’re kind of being a bit of\na weenie. Just like when she told us last Saturday that I could see Adrian and it took you days to get back to me.\nYou can pretend like you don’t know what you’re doing but no one would buy it. It didn’t serve you well this time and it’s not gonna serve you well\nnext time. At some point, you actually have to put the children first as Dr Brown or the next court appointed facilitator will do and quit thinking of\nyourself. Obviously, I’m documenting a consistent pattern going back to October for one thing or another.\nI’ve always had 50-50 custody of our kids but you block me at every move from seeing them since it is not “on strategy” with Anna Lisa as you told\nDebbie and she reminded me of. Even when I’ve done every thing you asked- blow test, meetings, dna analysis (not your bullshit hair test) your\nfreaking RO, that says I credibly will beat my kids.wtf is that?\nAt some point an adult will seethis Christine. One did yesterday. The difference next time is that you will have a proven track record of obstructionist\nbullshit to go along with it to reinforce you are a shitty mom who is focusing on deflecting blame. Just like you did for blowing up our family, or\nbeing inappropriate with Kevin Otero and lying about it.\nI wish I could respect your journey and feel like it had some merit, even if misguided. But it does not. You lie, cheat, and blame everyone but yourself.\nI actually feel bad for you. It’s a sign of someone who can’t cope with their own actions and needs it to be someone else’s fault. Always. Always.\nAlways. The reason you hate me, is I call it out.\nGood luck with that! Hope he makes you feel better about yourself and tells you that you are always right.\nSent:02/24/2024 at 12:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Just another day with V little\nMessage 1579 of 4024\nJust re-read Dr Brown’s note.

I’ll get really frustrated when you don’t find time, so I’m just gonna propose something that I’m gonna\nsend to Lisa. But I would like your approval at least for Phase II\nNote this is the fourth time I’ve had to type this up. I am really frustrated with OFW.  It fucking sucks.\nI would like to propose amendments to the restraining order in a phased approach. They include all the standard language about civility, decency, and\nkindness applying to topics around the kids and/or our fiscal situation. No change to that part.\nProposal to assure your concerns are met:\n\nPhase I - now we try to do everything here, it sucks\nPhase II - next RO, allow emergency/urgent OFW calls\nPhase III - use OFW for documentation purposes\n- Email\nPhase I - now I am a bystander not a participant\nPhase II - next RO, allow forwarding of fyi emails\nPhase III- tbd? allow for inline/normal emails\n- Text\nPhase I - now, nothing allowed\nPhase II - I’d like emergency/urgent texts\nPhase III - tbd? return to normal text communication\n- Calls\nPhase I - now, nothing allowed\nPhase II - I’d like emergency/urgent calls\nPhase III - tbd? return to normal text communication\nIdeally, we can agree that we could move forward with Phase II suggestions, if we both agree, via an email from Lisa to Annalisa on Monday. Then\nwhen she fixes the wrong RO she can make the change one time.\nJust like we were doing with Dr. Brown, if we do not adhere to the guidelines provided we revert back to the prior phase. This will incentivize us to\nboth make it work and be constructive and helpful moving forward.\nWhatever you do, I am asking you please to take the 10 minutes we spoke of earlier today, spend it on this,\nthink about it, and let me know. I hope this is a reasonable compromise that you feel good about.\nPlease give me a call for 5 min if you have concerns.\nThanks!\nMessage 1626 of 4024\nThank you for outlining below.\nI am extremely concerned and have been advised against texts and calls given the demonstrated history of harassment, anger and bullying, for topics\nthat are unrelated to parenting.

We will adhere to all the \"child or property\" related constraints as well as the civility and tone standards that\nneed to be observed. We will do this in a way that addresses your very real concerns about feeling like the mediums below are misused for attacks and\nthreats. Ideally, this is a baby step in a phased approach to normalcy.\nBelow is what I think we can agree on. I included \"urgent updates\" to the OFW call approvals and will adhere to the spirit. The purpose is if we have\nplans that go sideways that result in an inconvenient hardship or an urgent FYI but are not technically an \"emergency\". School nurse call or missed\ndrop off is what I am thinking. It has to be real. It has to be urgent.\nBlessed Updates:\n- Use OFW email for urgent updates but allow for OFW-facilitated phone calls if necessary and always for emergencies.\n- Allow emails with 3rd parties as proposed, and for \"fyi\" 1-1 initiated updates and inline responses, as necessary.\nOther Updates:\n- We sent Anna Lisa a request to remove a \"credible threat for physical violence \" last week, which I'm sure you saw.\nI think this covers the most critical obstacles to a constructive working protocol. I even think it could accommodate a \"running list\" format if we\nmutually agree it fits the definition proposed. If you do not, I am open to updating if you like, or just not facilitating that discussion for now. But I\nthink we desperately need it, and just need to be disciplined not to pervert the intent.\nI truly hope this is an accurate interpretation of your wishes and accommodates your concerns. If you feel like I am trying to nefariously manipulate\nyou or the situation, I am all ears. That is not my intent. It would be great to have this in place this week and see what it gets us. If you green light, I\nwill send to Lisa this AM. You may need to push Anna Lisa. tbh, she is slow.

Let’s not be those parents please.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 05:23 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 08:02 PM)\nSubject:What are you doing?\n\nMessage 1664 of 4024\nBy the way, it really hurt my feelings that you said I took everything. That makes me feel really bad. And I had hoped we would discuss it with the kids\nbefore it looked like I was stealing all the Kirkland stuff. You and I had agreed on the list to be sure it was fair.\nI think I took the couch and two chairs . I think you kept all the other big furniture in the whole house. I also took the bed at your suggestion, but\ngave you the beach bed. Then I took the outdoor furniture that you don’t use at all, no one does. And I got a bunch of junk from the beach but\noffered it to you first.\nI thought that was consistent with what we had agreed to. I was in no way trying to screw you at all. I thought we did some edits and updates by\nswapping things back-and-forth like the bed and the TV in the spirit of cooperation. I thought it was fair.\nThen I purchased a pit group from Amazon that was cheap and everything else has been consignment shopping or craigslist. I don’t like the image\nthat I have just stolen everything against your wishes.\nPlease let me know how we can resolve that situation if you feel like I’ve done something unfair. But also, please remember that dad‘s house is the boys\nhouse too. We just don’t have a parenting plan in place.\nWhat do you want back?\n-robert\nSent:02/26/2024 at 06:34 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 08:02 PM)\nSubject:Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1665 of 4024\nYou asked to take the table and guest bedroom  so I would have been left with the big couch and coffee table and kids and I bed.\nYou took the tvs off the walls and gave me two tvs that didn’t even work or fit in the brackets.\nIm keeping this short at Dr Brown advice and don’t care to go back and forth.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 08:06 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 09:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1666 of 4024\nExample of you getting upset at me when you gestured I come down, visibly frustrated then telling me to come down.\nIt’s not even like I have a reason or choice, just straight into do it my way or I will get annoyed and angry.\nThere is a reason I prefer not to.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 08:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/26/2024 at 09:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: What are you doing?\n\nMessage 1667 of 4024\nI wasn’t upset. I didn’t get angry. And I just like to put on a good face for AD. You always find a reason to say I’m bad but I’m not going to bite. I\nwish you well, Christine. I am really trying.\nSent:02/26/2024 at 09:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: What are you doing?\nMessage 1668 of 4024\nThanks for the feedback. I am going to wait to reply to this in the hope that we can find a constructive resolution. Thank you!\nSent:02/26/2024 at 10:09 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/27/2024 at 07:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Taking all our stuff\nMessage 1669 of 4024\nI’ll forward you the email I’m copy and pasting from below. We did as agreed except you kept the guest bedroom.\nYou also never had less than three working TVs on the house at all times- Master, Man Cave, AD’s room for three people.\nI moved TVs. I also had everything I owned put into trash bags. Tens of them, plus garbage. That was hard on me too.\nAs mentioned, just tell me what to send back I shouldn’t have taken. I’ll also help you find a cat room couch replacement.\nHave a great day!\nBest\nrobert",
