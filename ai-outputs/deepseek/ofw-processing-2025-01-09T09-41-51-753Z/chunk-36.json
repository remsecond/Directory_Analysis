During their conversation, they decided I would attend the next\nappointment to address some things on Adrian's mind. This is a significant breakthrough, as it's the first time he has agreed to have me join his session\nin all the months he has been going.\nI am excited about this opportunity, especially considering our near-total estrangement and the upcoming trip to Hong Kong, where all of these\nissues began after Elsa and your Mother's advice. The timing is perfect for a breakthrough, especially given the professional advice that there might be\nbetter ideas than the Hong Kong trip.\nI wanted to let you know that I was looking forward to a professionally facilitated discussion. However, you intervened and stopped it. You listed\nmany reasons against it and stated that Adrian voted against attendance because that would mean two full hours in a single week and you two felt like\nthat was too much to invest.\nMy Concerns:\n- I think you should have talked with me instead of letting Adrian vote on therapy without discussing it.\n- As the targeting parent, your influence in this discussion with him may affect his decision to talk to me.\n- You are making 100% of the mental health decisions for our family without any legal authority to do so.\n- This is not what the books Jennifer recommended say to do. We need to heed the advice we were given.\nReflection:\nDuring my first reunification meeting, you told Adrian that I had not blown, implying I was under the influence, which is medically impossible as I\nam on Vivitrol. Despite knowing this, you and Natalie demanded I take two 12-panel tests.\nThis is akin to giving Max a pregnancy test after a date – unnecessary and misleading. This demonstrates either a total lack of understanding of my\nsobriety program (big issue) or nefarious intentions. (bigger issue.) by you two.\nEither way, your actions misled Adrian, and you both used him as a pawn, especially troubling given Kari's concern that he was considering self-harm\nbecause he was caught in the middle when we started with her. He thinks this was him.\nRecap:\n- First reunification session: Adrian was misled and used as a pawn.\n- First requested Father/Son session: You unilaterally canceled it.\nMoving forward, I hope that any decisions regarding our children's mental health (or any other significant decisions) will involve me.\nAdditionally, I ask that we collectively make an effort to:\n- Start being honest with Adrian\n- Stop defaming me as his father\n- Avoid using Adrian as your pawn\nI remain optimistic because you were always a great mom before July. Even in December, when we had the Phase I parenting plan, things were good,\nand we worked well together.\n\n- Stop interfering with the mental health engagements run by professionals\nSent:07/11/2024 at 11:42 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/11/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:Therapy and Decision Making\n\n- Do not assert sole decision-making for the kid in the absence of legal orders\nrobert\nMessage 3561 of 4024\nI can't understand what you are saying here.

I felt like this was a pretty good explanation of our family. Of any family. Recognizing the dysfunctional past\nwe shared.\nI thought we were on the same page, making hard won progress. I wish I knew you felt differently so I could have tried to do even more. I just didn’t.\nWhen this all happened, you were my world. I would have done anything humanly possible for you. I tried to show you every day- lunches, dates,\nwalks, sex.\nI honestly believed what I was seeing.\nSent:07/13/2024 at 01:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/13/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Our Books\nAttachments:IMG_1444_1.PNG (147 KB)\n\nMessage 3618 of 4024\nYou are not really doing anything different.\nIn fact two letters in 50 hours is far worse.\nYou are just poking at me to fuck with me.\nSent:07/13/2024 at 10:48 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 06:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Reset\nMessage 3619 of 4024\nI would like to discuss:\nWhat a new start really means to you on OFW\nAdrian’s visit tomorrow and what he should bring\nConfirm that you will be sending my mail over\nDiscuss the mail I have addressed to both of us\nConfirm your stance on seeing kids before trip\nIf you plan to stay at war with me as promised\nAgree on Hong Kong communication expectations\nAgree on practical terms of Fridays agreement\nFigure out how to get camping stuff in garage\nSwap our thoughts on the house we both own\nIf you think we have a parenting plan in place\nUnderstand your thoughts on our reunification\nFind out how many developer weeks we have\nIf you plan to start applying what we are reading\nI’ll have more but that is a start.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 02:03 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 06:58 AM)\nSubject:Things I’d like to chat about\nMessage 3620 of 4024\nPlease stop the threats here and in email.\nSent:07/14/2024 at 06:58 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 08:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: OFW Reset\n\nMessage 3621 of 4024\nI will review and can respond in OFW later today.\nThere is one piece of mail that I will send with Alan.\nCould you keep communications to OFW please.\nThank you!\nSent:07/14/2024 at 07:00 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 07/14/2024 at 08:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: Things I’d like to chat about\nMessage 3622 of 4024\nI did not make a threat.
