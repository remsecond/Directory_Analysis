It is you and Annalisa. Every comment is\nabout what you and Annalisa are doing after my one request, which was that \"we\" and \"us\" would be the actual parents of Max and Adrian.\nYou say I am threatening you by asking to share notes on what has transpired on your watch. They will be shared anyway, but I hoped that you and I,\nas \"we\" and \"us,\" could partner together on the children we brought into this world, not you and an attorney vs. me and an attorney.\nCurrent Proposal:\n- Christine and Annalisa\nRejected Proposals:\n- Christine and Robert, the Moyer parents\n- Yurushka and the Moyers (rejected: regular dinners)\n- Debbie and the Moyers (rejected: new traditions)\n- Dr Brown and the Moyers (rejected: two parenting plans)\nThe entire descent into chaos and thoughts of self-harm started with the team you choose when we were in Debbie's office. We agreed that if you\nwould not let me be involved with the family for the holidays, I would get a place in Bellevue to begin \"new traditions.\"\nThis was horrible and painful to me, but I did it at a significant cost to our fiscal health because it was what we agreed was best for the kids. Then you\npulled out and attributed it to the plan Annalisa had advised. You said it plain as day to Debbie, and I have plenty of details.\nSince it has been Kabuki theatre with you, over and over, we see professionals and get advice, spending Dec-Feb to get Dr Brown's feedback. And with\nthe brief exception of the end of December, you defer to the plan you and Annalisa have devised instead of recommendations.\nI want to ensure you do not consider this a threat. When I see a months-long pattern of rejecting professional advice, refusing to work with me\nconstructively, and then asking to repeat the way we got here as your only next step, I am not so inclined based on the past.\nFor that matter, who on earth would be? Do you have a single positive thing to show for your plans? I was doing great with both our kids till July 4th,\nand then July 5th. Our history shows that included you too.

I picked Max and Adrain up from the bus stop after school per regular schedule,\nand he informed me what happened, it hurt but was fine. I observed it was slightly swollen, and we elevated and iced and gave him a Motrin. We\ndiscussed an urgent care visit, but decided against it, as it seemed to be ok and he was walking fine but a little tender.\nMax went to school the next day (yesterday) as normal. I dropped Adrain and Max directly at school as Adrian was leaving for camp. Max said it was\ntender, but declined using a crutch or boot, as he deemed unnecessarily based on pain level at that time. During the day, he called and indicated it was\nhurting a little more, and we agreed to have it checked out, out of abundance of caution. I made an 8pm appointment at Seattle Childrens Urgent\nCare, as he wanted to attend the after school Tech Theater program. I picked up from his bus stop at 7pm, and we visited Seattle Childrens at 8pm.\nUpon examination, they suggested an xray to rule out broken bones, and confirmed it was in fact just bruised.

I'm trying to work with you for the sake of the kids.\nBut you just don't let me agree with you, and you want to keep it all the secret. I have no idea how to get through to you. You seem so dead set on my\ndestruction that you will not acknowledge or help me be a better father, you just want to win. I don't get that, Christine. it's not winning if they lose.

I\nhope at some point we share the view that all of our kids should have a healthy relationship with us both.\nIt’s not a win for you to have them hate me like you do. We did have some amazing time as a family that is being completely scrubbed from their mind\nto focus solely on the negative. And at the same time, I have no way to have healthy conversations to heal.\n\nWhen a parent will not show forgiveness to the other and openly harbors resentment, it will have significant implications for a child's development\nand worldview. Not eliminating one parent from a child's life, despite challenging dynamics, is crucial for several reasons, to all involved, particularly\nin teaching healthier emotional and interpersonal skills for all:\n\nresolving conflicts is acceptable behavior. This will impact how the child handles conflicts in their own relationships throughout life. Demonstrating\nforgiveness and conflict resolution, even in difficult situations, teaches children about empathy, understanding, and the complexities of human\nrelationships.\n\nRemoving a parent from a child's life will lead to emotional distress and issues such as anxiety and depression. When this separation is compounded\nby visible resentment by one parent, the child will be taught to associate relationships with perpetual conflict and negativity, which can hinder their\nemotional development. It’s critical to remember how you want your child to be as their own adult.\n\nA child's identity is shaped by their understanding of and relationships with their parents. Witnessing ongoing resentment will instill feelings of\ninsecurity and doubt, potentially leading to issues with self-esteem and self-worth as the child might feel they are somehow at fault or inherently\nproblematic. While unreasonable, a child will likely blame themselves for not stopping regrettable behavior.\n\nLearning from the behavior of parents is a primary way children develop social skills. If they see that one parent never forgives the other, they will\nemulate this inability to forgive in their own social interactions, affecting friendships and other relationships. Conversely, if they see forgiveness and\nSent:04/28/2024 at 08:20 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/28/2024 at 12:37 PM)\nSubject:For Your Consideration\n\ncompassion, they will value these traits.\n\nChildren model their future relationships on their interpretations of their parents' interactions. Exposure to unresolved resentment will predispose a\nchild to struggle with trust and to potentially replicate such dynamics in their own adult relationships. It is critically important to see how parents deal\nwith past situations even if there might have been conflict. This is true to life and they are learning important values now.\n\nMaintaining contact with both parents, when safe and possible, allows the child to receive a more balanced perspective on interpersonal relationships.\nIt helps them see multiple sides to situations and to understand that even people can have flaws yet still be worthy of love and connection. They learn\nnot to shut people out and to be compassionate.\n\nchild's right to have a relationship with both parents. Cutting off a parent without substantial reasons can contravene these principles and potentially\nharm the child in the long run. When a child is cut off from another parent legal remedies should be perused. Unless there is active abuse, this is not\nhealthy.\nIt is essential, therefore, to foster an environment where forgiveness and reconciliation are valued, not only for the immediate benefit of the child's\nemotional environment but also for their long-term ability to build and sustain healthy relationships.\nProfessional support from counselors or therapists can be vital in navigating these complex family dynamics, focusing on the child’s best interests,\nhelping all to move towards a more positive and constructive relationship without ostracizing a parent.\nAgain, I am asking to have a mental health discussion for our kids, free of judgment or finger pointing. How we got to this place is less material than\nrecognizing we are here and providing a way for us all to heal in a safe and therapeutic way.

She offered this Wednesday as an option if all parties wanted to do it.\nMessage 2624 of 4024\nShe said she is all for more shared family dialogue.\nShe said she would love to lead the discussion herself.\nShe suggested we do this as soon as Wednesday if we like.\nWe agree on Max and his attendance not being mandatory,\nYou can spin this any way you want. I intentionally asked you to be there for the discussion. I am so tired of hearing things are \"not really that way\"\nbecause you have some secret, covert, shady ass story of how you were really there when it happened, or you really heard it but the witness got it\nwrong, or now, that you refused to have the discussion together as I have asked over and over, even again today, that it is not what you heard.\nHow about this, if you want to engage constructively for our kids, stop all this secret bullshit and nonsense. I'm not used to this crap in my world.\nAnd now ,you even say you have the kids' diaries but would rather use them against me than to help us define a better parenting plan for them both.\nWhat is it with you and never being above board (I'll leave Kevin out this time)? You were never this way before. But now it's honestly your MO.\nSent:04/29/2024 at 07:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 04/29/2024 at 08:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Family Meeting Idea\nMessage 2625 of 4024",
