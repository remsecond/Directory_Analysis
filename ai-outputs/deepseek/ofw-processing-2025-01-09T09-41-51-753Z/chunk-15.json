But we can discuss. Dr Brown not only did not do what was outlined. She went further to say she is specifically avoiding doing\nthat. Given it was your suggestion, and I wanted to work with you, I agreed. I think that was fair. But it’s so far off the rails I have not destination even\nin sight.\nAnd I agree that it was traumatizing. It was for you and I both as well. But you and I have been given a small chance at least to discuss. We still disagree\nbut we can be civil and even see each other. AD has not had that opportunity. He is shut out of both an explanation or what I have apologized for.\nThe net is it continues to fester. The fact that he can’t get a reasonable explanation from his father just reinforces the idea it was nefarious. I know you\nare doing what you think is right, but shutting out one whole side of the story and allowing him to draw his own conclusions seems\ncounterproductive.\nLet’s shine some light on this and let him decide.\nDr Brown has no intention of helping the situation.\n\nSent:02/14/2024 at 11:11 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/14/2024 at 11:12 AM)\nSubject:Re: AAU\n\nMessage 1389 of 4024\nHe knows your side as he shared it with me.

That is super easy to\nunderstand.\nI don’t link her to Yurushka. She had an obligation to talk to you. It’s probably an oath they take?\nBut she did not have an obligation to say she did not talk to you, when she did.\nIf this was a police investigation do you really think that would fly? Hell no.

I don't care to fight.\nFor that matter. Given your reaction this morning, I want to respect your position and don't care to communicate much anymore. You said we both\nwanted peace and explained what it would take to get to normalcy. I tried for almost two weeks, and you were mostly pleasant in OFW for which I\nappreciate. But we got nothing done, no olive branch, and today we only got worse. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy kicking the football. You can\nGoogle it...\nBut you asked about the cams that you sent over with the exact same mounts (one single, one none) you said you never knew existed and if they did,\nyou never knew about them. I won't disagree with you. I just saw you had packed them away and eventually sent them to me. I won't confirm or deny\nyou knew of them. You just handled them. I gave you the ring for xmas. I did not install it. The others were set up but were not reliable or all that\nuseful. We took the white indoor cams down, you put the away, but left the outdoor cams up as a deterrent.\n- Sending a pic of the Amazon purchase before Xmas in 2020. Install date is unknown tbh.\n- Sharing a pic of the outdoor cams, please note how the mounts match the newer ones.\nAt the risk of repeating myself, I am not saying you knew but you asked two questions I'd like to offer my thoughts on.\nOne: \"If we had them, why didn't I have the Blink App installed?\"\nI don't know. If you say you never installed it I believe you. I had it, they did a shitty job so perhaps we stopped using them before you even needed to.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 02:42 PM)\nSubject:Your Questions This AM\nAttachments:Amazon_Screen_Purchases.jpg (261 KB)\nimage_50434817.JPG (1 MB)\n\nYou never installed the Beach Cams either. But I had shared them with you (indoor and outdoor) and knew those worked, but never installed the app\nfor those.\nThat said, you also never installed:\n- Nest App- It works well, you are aware of it, and never installed it, but ask me to use it for you.\n- Sleep Number App- It is also helpful but you never installed it. But maybe just did not need to.\n- Frame Apps- We had them in the living room and used them daily. You choose not to install.\n- Samsung App- It sets the picture you see in the cat room and bedroom. You did not install.\n- Alexa- You still have several cam/audio devices that can drop in on me. Not sure what's up.\nWhen we were a loving couple doing our own thing, lots of times I would be geeked out on something, you would smile and nod, feign interest but\nnot really act. That was normal.\nTwo: \"If we had them, I would have remembered them?\"\nI don't have any reason to believe you would not, so this may be true too. And I won't fight if you really believe that you have no memory of that. I\nwill say that we do forget things sometimes, however. Everyone does.\nThis could be a long list, but you will get the point:\nCarbon Monoxide Detector- I made a pretty big deal of this, explaining that I always am sure to take them on vacation with us. I talked about why I\ndo that and all the crazy AirBnB stories that made me scared. I wanted to protect our family and noted that I would be taking it to protect your\nbrother along with Justin and Josh. For some reason, it was being used as a WiFi repeater in your clear line of the site where you spend hours every\nweek. Maybe you forgot?\nPrivate Moments- I asked you recently if you remember our Hyatt stay. You didn't. This surprised me. It was one of the few times we made time for\nan overnight together. In the end, we bickered on the way home, but that night, and especially the morning, was an all-time great freaking sweaty, sexy\ntime. WOW!! And.. we took crazy explicit pics of you. By far the hardest core thing we ever did. Face and all. I won't attach pics. I would think you\nwould remember, but don't.\nMy point is everyone forgets things but believes they are absolutely in command of the facts. I have even watched Netflix documentaries on it. It is\ncalled the \"eyewitness memory distortion \" effect. It's a fascinating human phenomenon and it's super interesting to see it broken down and explained.\nThat said, who knows, maybe I did not even mention it to you. I may be guilty of the same thing and thought I told you but didn't. But like the\n\"Alexa drop in\" we used often at times; it was just normal when we were a happy family. We did not think of it as spying.\nThis is of course equally true of:\n- Our shared ATT family plan\n- Parental control for the kids\n- Screen time alerts for the kids\n- New device joining Xfinity alerts\nI don't really care about what the Luddites in the family law world or the perversion of good intentions into bad, that this has become. When we were\na happy family, this was all approved, discussed, and, welcomed. Protecting your kids in the real world is expected. And phone bills have had call/text\nhistory since long before cell phones even existed.\nYou didn't ask about things rejoining the network today or about alerts that pop like Blink did. But you have seen them with Samsung Alerts. So, at a\nminimum, you have to realize this is a true and demonstratable network phenomenon. I can also prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the cams DO\nNOT work in the places you saw them, in the open, pointing at exterior doors.\nAt this point, I have digressed. But you asked two questions about the cams, and I wanted to give you, my thoughts. If in reading this, you think that\nit is simply impossible that what I am saying could ever be true, that's you right. I am only offering my true and honest perspective on the event that\nhas traumatized you, because I never had any desire to surveil you.... ever.\nAs mentioned, many times before I am happy to prove this to you in front of your eyes. I have also told you that I bought the new ones at the\n\nNorthgate Target and the Blink account was deleted when I realized what it was doing. I wish I could have shown you everything the moment I\nrealized this was happening when I cam over the next day. But we are where we are.\nMaybe someday we come to terms with all this, but I'm not hopeful anymore. No dialog or shared exchange of perspectives will only entrench and\nincrease the hate for one another.\nMessage 1424 of 4024\nI appreciate you responding to my questions below with that level of detail.\nOne thing that really jumped out for me, and now I am terrified of, given the volatility of the situation, and past threats, is mention of explicit pictures\nwith my face on them.\nI am going to ask you destroy those. Please confirm once that is done.\nWhen reading the different forms and options, pics, videos and other images of a sexual nature, that could be used as a weapon, could be ordered\ndeleted.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 02:49 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 02:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nMessage 1425 of 4024\nSo...

You seem dead set on not even considering an\nalternative explanation for the cams or the physical abuse claims you levied against me.\nIn your heart. Like really deep down below all the hate and willful destruction you have for me, you know, the kids know, the world knows I never\nbeat you or my kids.

You also had one on your desk but not sure what it was used for, but\nknow it acts as the receiver for watching video and listening for audio. I didn't know about them so moved them from Alki to Bellevue thinking they\nwere innocent. I still assume they are, but want to confirm.\nBut both have drop-in enabled. So as we have done so many times in the past, you can just \"drop in\" unannounced and see and hear everything that\ngoes on in the most private spaces of my home, not outside in public view where the expectation of privacy is far different. These were great when we\nneeded them for a quick check in on the kids.\nThen of course, a bunch more (registered to you, again) came over recently that if I plug in, can also monitor audio and video via drop-in. That is\nactually how I found out about the other two that were in my place for who knows how long. I drilled into who they were currently registered to and\nwhat they were capable of.\nSent:02/15/2024 at 05:55 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/15/2024 at 06:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Your Questions This AM\nAttachments:image_123650291__10_.JPG (269 KB)\nimage_123650291__9_.JPG (289 KB)\n\nI want to be helpful and hope after all of this mess on my, you are not using these \"drop-in\" devices for anything nefarious.

And again- I honestly do not think you are.\nThis was one of the core reasons I tried to open a dialog with you this week. It is in the emails I sent and on the list you asked me to document of\nthings to discuss. I don't believe this is intentional, especially after all we have struggled with in this area. And that's why I wanted it to stay between\nus. I totally give you the benefit of the doubt here.\nSo let me know how would like to proceed given we can't communicate peacefully. I still want to resolve this constructively, but I'm stuck between a\nrock and a hard place if I can't even talk to you about it. And I am NOT making any threats. I am NOT coming after you for cameras in my place. I\nam looking to resolve this and prefer not to go through attorneys.\nCan you let me know your thoughts? If you go dark, I'll assume you are going straight to Anna Lisa instead of working with me. I hope that is not the\ncase for the aforementioned reasons. I honestly believe this is an innocent mistake we can just resolve. I can even talk you through \"unregistering\"\nthem so you can't drop in on me anymore!\nLet's please use common sense and just let me help...

The continuing blame on me for how you feel and situation is incredible. You have control of\nyour actions.\nIf you have decided you can’t look for gainful employment, that is a choice you have made. The relationship with Max is a direct consequence of your\ninteractions with him. I can go on. Putting blame on me for your situation is again a choice you are making.\nA theme that has been recurring in your life has been its always someone else’s fault for your woes and resulting behavior that results, your\nupbringing, your mom, your dad, your boss, the therapists, and now you have trained it squarely on me as the reason for all things bad.\nIt’s certainly one way to go through life if that’s worked for you. The past 25 years, I pushed forward inspite of what was happening. I could have\neasily taken the same approach but I didn’t.  I’m going to continue that approach but have also pivoted to not accept actions towards me that are\ncompletely unacceptable and will not sweep things under the rug. That did not serve me well and I finally woke up to that.\nActions have consequences which you have never fully felt, and are understandably jarred that you are being held accountable.\nEverything that took a turn was a result of some action taken.

Why would I subject myself to that other than to calm and appease you.\nSent:02/16/2024 at 06:04 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 02/16/2024 at 06:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Touch Base\nMessage 1466 of 4024\nI’m on now.

If I never get the chance I cannot. Everything gets more frustrating and the issues that cause the anxiety\njust compound. Two minutes, that’s all.
