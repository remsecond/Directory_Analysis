That is the reality that majority\nof humans deal with.\nI don’t see any outstanding issues at this time that need me to be in this platform for the next few hours, so yes I am going to pivot to chores I can’t get\ndone during a working week PLUS work.\nSent:03/02/2024 at 09:29 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/02/2024 at 10:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Are you done?\nMessage 1796 of 4024\nThanks!\nThat is not my expectation. My expectation is that if we are solving an issue, we either do that or you let me know you are stepping away.

They both seem to need an answer so I can plan.\nThe suggestions for Dr Brown improving us can wait but are important.\nAbout the whole job thing, I know you mentioned that a lot, and don’t understand why I don’t do the same thing you do.\nI think the easiest explanation is a simple recognition of what is going on. I had my whole life turned upside down on July 5. I found out you were\nfooling around with a married man who works for you. I soon had my kids taken, my house taken, and then a restraining orders put on me that say I\nbeat you and my kids.\nSo think of it this way. You launched an unexpected attack on a neighboring country-me. You bomb me day and night. I thought we were at peace,\nallies. We are not now in a covert move. So you go about your business. Your attack was planned. I alternatively am fighting for my life to understand\nwhat my future is.\nIt’s a pretty accurate metaphor.

I recognize and respect your need for time and space to heal as we navigate the\ncomplexities of our current situation. The point I would like to make thoughtfully and constructively again is that the \"time to heal\" path is the one\nwe have taken since this began. So, reflecting on the results of that path, I am discouraged. I would propose balancing the \"time to heal\" with an\noption that at least changes up the recipe that has only made things worse by engaging in a neutral activity, which could serve as a meaningful step\ntowards this goal.\nI want to remove the tensions that mark our interactions by providing a space where we can be in the same room and enjoy a shared moment someone\nelse is directing. It is not about forgetting the challenges we face or disagreements that remain; it's about creating a moment that reminds us of the\nfundamental respect and connection that sustained us in better times. I hope the new ingredient in our recipe helps us respect our shared history and\nour love for our kids so we can establish a more congenial relationship that allows us to make decisions with less emotion and in their best interest.\nI understand this is a small step in a much larger journey of healing and reconciliation, and it doesn’t pretend to be a cure-all for the challenges we\nface. But given that what we are doing today is not working, I believe it's worth taking if it can lead us towards a more respectful and understanding\nrelationship, acknowledging our shared history and our love for our family. As mentioned, I'm open to this or any other activity that feels right to\nyou, and I'm committed to listening to your thoughts and suggestions. I'll wait, but let's find a way to move forward that honors our children and our\nindividual paths to healing.\nI know this scares you. I know you have concerns. But I assure you it is not meant to replace your healing process, which I fully respect and support. It\nis to complement it. What we are doing is not working, so I'm grateful for your willingness to consider this on our journey toward becoming effective\nco-parents. And we can always just walk away if we don't enjoy it. Let's blow some glass!\nHave a great day....\nSent:03/03/2024 at 11:12 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/03/2024 at 11:26 AM)\nSubject:Re: Improving our Relationship for Everyone\n\nMessage 1811 of 4024\nThank you for the thoughtful words.

This period of separation has prompted me to appreciate the magnitude of what we've achieved over the\nyears. Despite our differences, perhaps even our incompatibilities, we've built something truly significant, and it shows in our kids. It's a testament to\nour efforts, my deep respect for you, and what we've tried to accomplish together.\nPerhaps later than you, I realize that we are far more different as human beings than I knew before- on so many levels. I believe neither of us was ready\nfor what we dove headlong into on \"Ashbury beach picture day\" with a belief we could will our way through, with best intentions, ignoring our own\nbaggage from our pasts. Our commitment to making marriage work was remarkable in itself. Whether driven by love, duty, or the sheer desire to\nuphold our vows, what we did was real, challenging, and worthy of recognition.\nI don't want another long message, instead, I'll simply express my hope for a future where we can sit down together, acknowledging the good times\nand the tough, with a focus on moving forward. In a future where we appreciate our efforts without judgment, we understand that we may not have\nbeen fully prepared for the challenges we faced, but we recognize the sincerity of our attempts. I'll be the first to admit that I wish I had the wisdom\nyou have now, back then, and made an effort to change sooner. Hindsight is 20/20.\nI acknowledge your efforts are coming from a place you believe is best. But I hope you will open up to a shared perspective from someone who has\nlessons of his own from the past he wants to share from also.\nI'm here if you need anything. And I mean that. Have a great day.\n-robert\nSent:03/04/2024 at 05:42 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/04/2024 at 06:48 AM)\nSubject:Hoping for a Good Week\nMessage 1820 of 4024\nFigured out a way to use the component you had in the car Saturday.

The second could be dicey, right? The simple answer for her is to say, \"Submit\nand let the attorneys duke it out.\" In theory, that's great, but it really translates to \"we won't have a temp in place before a formal mediation.\"\nWe have flat out agreed 100% to terms of an RO, in writing and we are still arguing about it a whole month later. That is probably a bunny slope\ncompared to the triple black we are about to point our skis down. She said to \"disagree and move forward\" but we are not, and we are stuck.\nThis is not a dig. It's a realistic assessment of where are before we talk to a mental health professional when we have a history that we cannot agree on,\nand who we seem to selectively take advice from. IMHO, what we really need is a \"temp mediator\" and she won't play that role.\nI almost think we should have a list of things we know we are going to disagree on and just ask her for help. Otherwise, it's a rinse and repeat where she\nwill say \"This is just my advice as a professional\" then we \"hear what we want to hear\" followed by doing what we want to do.\nThen we're stuck with in same situation with our kids paying the price for adult disagreements.\nMessage 1855 of 4024\nDid Greg let you know yet?

I will update our Teams meeting accordingly and see you at 3:00.\nI also want to continue our working relationship the way we have done the last couple of days and correct what just happened.

And if it happens\nanyway, despite this, I am proposing we note that and ask for a resolution of either stopping the conversation or giving the other a chance to correct\nor reconcile the triggering action. We need to afford each other the opportunity to course correct a mistake.\nPlease consider these suggestions.\n- Respectful Tone: Speak as if to your boss, respectfully and thoughtfully as if you might get fired.\n- No Recap's: Allow each person to express their thoughts without interruption or a \"playback.\"\n- No Abrupt Endings: Don't end conversations suddenly after disagreements. Ask for an apology first.\n- Listen Actively: Show you're listening without interrupting, using nods or brief acknowledgments.\n- Use \"I\" Statements: Say \"I feel...\" instead of \"you make me...\" to express personal feelings without blame.\n- Pause Before Responding: Take a moment to think before replying to provide more thoughtful responses.\n- Avoid Assumptions: Don't assume intentions or feelings; ask for clarification and limit predetermination.\n- Stay on Topic: Focus on the current issue without bringing up unrelated past grievances. Note if it happens.\n- Respect Boundaries: If someone needs a break, respect it. Agree on when to continue the conversation.\n- Use Neutral Language: Be factual and use non-inflammatory words to keep the discussion productive.\nDo you agree? Can we do this in a calm way and ask each other to follow these together?\nSent:03/05/2024 at 02:43 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 03/05/2024 at 02:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Before Dr Brown\nMessage 1883 of 4024\nOk.

I have him for ski Sunday.\nMax has robotics competition Saturday which I planned to attend in afternoon after Adrian basketball.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 05:15 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 05:46 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\nMessage 1894 of 4024\nThanks... what about today?

We are in a situation where he has 3 more Sundays for\nski. This week it would be equivalent as you would have Friday and Saturday.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 06:19 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 06:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\n\nIf you want to do the weekend march 23/24 take him and Dylan to ski on Sunday, please do. I don’t expect that anytime kids have an event or activity\nthat falls on your day, I’m penalized for time away so you get my time. I need non school time with them too.\nThis Wednesday, today, I also see we have meeting with Kari Bates so would not have been able to anyway. So now I’m annoyed you are kicking up a\nstink.\nMessage 1898 of 4024\nOur Phase I, as you know had Wed 1/2 days. We did this because I shot hoops with him several times a week and the plan limited it to us to once\nevery two weeks. That was a huge reduction and you graciously accommodated a smaller reduction. Dr Brown had agreed to update the plan but as\nshe mentioned, her memory is bad and did not.\nYou are just ignoring Wed and that is four opportunities a month that I had and you are making no mention of at all and going on about overnights\nand skiing. You have had him solo for several months now and ski with him every weekend. Does that count as “non-school” time because I am\nconfused about what you are saying.\nYou can get mad at me and start yet another fight, but that’s what you said you would stop. I don’t think either of us remembered Kari Betts as you\nmight not have scheduled him today for something. I also addressed this in the email I noted you should see below but ignored. So here we are again.\nI would prefer to briefly talk about this so we don’t get mad and have crossed wires. Dr Brown said to resume Phase I now. That is not what I see. If\nthat’s what your choice is let’s call a spade a spade and move on. But all the narrative below on what you do while you have him 100% if the time is\nconfusing. I just want to follow Dr Brown’s guidance.\nThanks. You can be “annoyed” I asked but it’s frankly not helpful and incendiary to the conversation.\nLet’s both do better.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 06:57 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\nMessage 1899 of 4024\nI realize you made the Kerri Betts appointment.

Adrian tutoring is not dependent on me being home.\nI’d like to ask if you shorten emails. I see them and mentally note to come back when I have more time to digest and that causes frustration in your\nend as you see I open and then don’t respond.\nSent:03/06/2024 at 07:24 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 03/06/2024 at 09:07 AM)\nSubject:Re: AD and The Plan\nMessage 1902 of 4024\nThis is the 11th email in this thread and I still don’t know if I have Phase I Wednesday’s again.\nYou said you would stop fighting.
