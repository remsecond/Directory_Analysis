You are going to have to grant me some leeway here as it is a one-sided discussion without you in\nreal-time. I am trying my best, Christine.\nQuestion One: Was the RO filed yesterday?\n- No. The new RO was sent over yesterday. The court document that was filed was titled: \"CONFIRMATION OF ISSUES/REFERRAL TO\n\n- Here is what you filed for the court saying there is domestic violence: \"Has either party alleged (said) that domestic violence is an issue in this case?\"\n\nQuestion Two: Communications - can you propose something that you feel is more appropriate. I’m concerned about calls or emails and texts as it is\ndemonstrated they have been ugly, tone is confrontational, scary etc. nothing in recent history demonstrates that will change. I am open to your\nsuggestion.\nBelow is what Anna Lisa proposed:\nSent:02/06/2024 at 10:47 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/06/2024 at 11:05 AM)\nSubject:Re: Domestic Abuse\n\n\"The Restrained Person may not text, email, or telephone the Protected Person EXCEPT as specifically permitted herein. The parties may\ncommunicate via the Our Family Wizard application, and the Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely for the purpose\nof co-parenting the parties’ children and/or for communicating regarding the management of shared assets. The parties may also communicate via\nemail with third parties included to facilitate business concerning their minor children and/or managing the parties’ shared assets.\nBelow is what I would like to propose:\n- Our Family Wizard: The Restrained Person will communicate with the Protected Person solely to co-parent the parties’ children and/or to\ncommunicate regarding the management of shared assets. As the primary and first option, OFW will be used for direct, straightforward\ncommunications. This platform is preferred for simple, immediate matters requiring mutual agreement or notification.\n- Email for Detailed Discussions: The parties may communicate via email with third parties to facilitate business concerning their minor children\nand/or manage the parties’ shared assets. Given the complexity of certain discussions, direct email communication is also permitted for in-depth,\nmulti-topic communications and or \"FYI notifications\", without the mandatory inclusion of a third party. This is under the condition that both\nparties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone. If a communication is deemed potentially contentious, a mutually agreed upon third\nparty may be included at the discretion of either party for oversight, with prior written agreement.\n- Texts and Calls with Consent: Direct texts and calls are allowed only for emergencies or with prior consent from Christine for situations deemed\nurgent or complex. If it is a non-emergency, each instance requires a prior written agreement in the Our Family Wizard platform or a related email.\nThis is under the condition that both parties agree to maintain a respectful and constructive tone.\n- Additional Conditions: Should either party feel the other is not adhering to these communication guidelines, the terms herein will be subject to\nreview and potential revision to ensure compliance and the continued protection of both parties.\nI think this sets us up for longer-term success (important, so we are not doing this every two weeks as we grow as co-parents) but also still allows for\nthe opportunity to re-visit if one of us starts behaving badly... It is optimistic but the best of both worlds with a built-in \"out\".\nThanks in advance for your thoughtful consideration. (Doing this email in OFW sucked btw )\nrobert\nMessage 1148 of 4024\nBTW- There is no RO. There never has been. I know you kept saying that, but Anna Lisa never filed it. I've reviewed all the case history.\nI sent my thoughts separately as I anticipated this and wanted to be as helpful as I could given today is mandatory \"in the office\" day and likely back to\nback..\nAck- on availability. Too bad I can't swing by with fresh poke, avocado and lemons... I really enjoyed taking care of you, seeing you smile.

She asked to have the conversation with them prior to us which makes sense to me. My goal is to update of\nsituation, impact to all parties, and how to navigate moving forward. She will provide a recommendation that we will consider. We all have a different\nperspective on what occurred. Impact to Adrian and me was/is real. I am not going to brush aside Adrian’s concerns that he expressed to me. I’d like\nto confirm with Dr Brown for Ad before we lose the spot and it gets pushed out further.\n<<We do need to align. The only context she has to define her plan of action is your email. That's it. She has no idea who and why to involve in the\ndiscussion and why? I would like to align, as I have mentioned from day one. Not just today, but every single day since this started. Only responding\nto the 10th request a day or two before we do this is not grounds for saying \"well it's too late, let's go with it.\" Further, this was about AD and I. That\nis it. We both saw it and were never given a chance to discuss or explain.\nSo now we need to discuss reunification as a result and if we handle the situation in a way, healthiest for him. And what we should do in the future. It\nis appropriate for those impacted by what AD saw- AD, Me, you, to have that conversation. No one else. This is not about relitigating something I\napologized for, and as you say, we both disagree on. Dr Brown should not be making that judgment. She is not qualified>>\nA shared proposal I hope we can both get behind and work as a team:\n- Goal: Get advice from Dr Brown on moving forward with reunification in the best interest of AD, Mom, and Dad. This includes what we should\nhave done differently.\n- Scope: Adrian should explain what he saw, express any concerns that arose from that, and allow for Mom and Dad to offer their perspectives on the\nwe handled it.\n- Participants: Everyone who was an actual witness to the event that night- That includes: Adrain- saw, Dad- saw, and Mom- heard AD's reaction and\nimmediate concerns. .\n- Deliverables: Reunification plan for Adrian and Dad. A discussion of proposed guidance on co-parenting moving forward. Adjustment to parenting\nplan if necessary.\nSent:02/07/2024 at 01:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 02/07/2024 at 03:33 PM)\nSubject:Re: If it stays sunny...\n\n- How We Use:  I'd like to agree here.
