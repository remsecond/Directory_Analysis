So can we have a\none topic conversation about our kids? You keep logging on, shooting arrows and logging off immediately. It’s not helpful.\nOne is leaving the state. The other is coming back to shore and I won’t see him for two weeks at best except maybe therapy. I had zero say in anything\nthis summer after being the primary caregiver giver last year across three different countries. Sixty six total days w/o you. The same number of days\nwithout incident.\nAnd in the last two weeks:\n- You did not allow me even a hello for his birthday\n- You didn’t take him basketball so I missed him there\n- You threatened legal action for our phone call\n- You would not let me drop gifts off at the mailbox\n- You will not permit a welcome home hug from me\n- And just now, you asserted you have a plan the allows me zero visits apart from the six supervised hours every two weeks. And that is all I get, period.\nI reread the communications. You are incorrect. And it speaks to other options to see him in the same mail. Your assertion is patently false. You know\nthat.\nI am asking you again, please don’t block me from my children or my children from me. Just like his birthday, then his gift dropped at the mailbox, his\nbasketball games, this hug is simple, harmless, but a small gesture that demonstrates I am there for him. No matter what adult business we have going\non. He sees he is number one, not taking a backseat to personal agendas. I know this is healthy for him.\nI think it really comes down to the fact that you believe you are the singular parent to our children and  they are better off with only you instead than\nhaving both of us. I don’t know a single expert, who says that. Please reconsider your total blackout. You were not even in the country for 2.5 months\nlast year and I did great!
