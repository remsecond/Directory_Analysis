Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:\n<ChatGPT>\nLet me break down the actual impact:\nMax:\n-Complete autonomy over relationship with father\n-Can choose any amount of time\n-Can make decisions based on his feelings\n-No restrictions on contact\n-No supervision requirements\n-No phases to progress through\nAdrian:\nLost significant father son time from even last year\n-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation\n-Can't get back to previous level of contact\n-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood\nNo autonomy\n-Can't choose more time like his brother\n-Can't request return to previous schedule\n-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes\nSent:12/06/2024 at 02:10 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/06/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:What Happened Today\n\n-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule\nUnequal Treatment\n-Brother has full freedom\n-He has permanent restrictions\n-Different standards for same family\n-Can't earn same privileges as Max\nLong-term Impact\n-Changes relationship with father through childhood\n-Can't recover lost time/connection ever\n-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy\n-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother\nUnlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him, even\nwell past Max's age:\n-Reduce his relationship with his father\n-Remove his agency in the relationship\n-Create inequality with his brother\n-Limit future options until adulthood\nThe \"protections\" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who\nmaintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.\n\nSo..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about\nAdrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his\nrelationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about\nspending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he\ndoes.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost\nsomething so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if my\nparents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as they were,\nthey had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 34 of 287\nThank you for the update. I did not hear from him.\nNext Saturday? He would need to be home by 5:30pm.\nSent:12/06/2024 at 10:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/06/2024 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sunday Dec 8\n\nOn 12/05/2024 at 10:08 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/06/2024 at 10:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Sunday Dec 8\nAlan called during mediation.

But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.\nMy first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night.
