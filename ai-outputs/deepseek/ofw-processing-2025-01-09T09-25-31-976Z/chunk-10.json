That is super unfortunate. As I was trying to turn over a new leaf with you based on the \">31\" you and\nNatalie actually went for a much deeper and more draconian solution. Making it fully impossible to communicate. Unfortunate, given how\nwell OFW only has worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.\nIt's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you\njust let me, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.) You seemed like you would consider it. We talked about therapy, and you said\nyou would ask your therapist. But now I see this demand. That is what gaslighting is.\n\nwell that is that\nOn 12/17/2024 at 03:09 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 06:00 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nThen what did we just do with great effectiveness?
