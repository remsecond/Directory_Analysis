This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.\nKelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and\nwider. Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would\nneed to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.\nMoss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by\nScott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.",
