  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 47 of 287\nWould you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly when\nwe meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.\nBefore this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18. Something\nthat allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.\nBut taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are about\nthat. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.\nIt was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were “real\nSent:12/08/2024 at 04:33 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today",
