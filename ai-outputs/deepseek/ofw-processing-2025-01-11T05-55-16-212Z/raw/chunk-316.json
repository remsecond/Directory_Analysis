  "text": "Hospital.. you know after you touched my arm I asked you not too, you got upset and followed me. That woman asked if everything was ok. You\nstarted talking about our sex life. If you continue to dispute that, you have not learned anything.\nJust like three years sober. That’s a lie\nThe fact I did not respond in a 15 min timeframe today was no reason to send these messages.\nNutcracker tickets were purchased prior to rescheduling to today. If you plan to weaponize changes in schedule I accommodated against me, that just\nsets the stage.\nLooking forward to getting the PC on board and hearing from Sound Practices. Did you share my contact information with them already?\nOn 12/14/2024 at 03:56 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/14/2024 at 04:17 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nObviously I sent him home because AD was super worried about going tonight. And with no info on if that’s happening either way, I gave my\ntime up.\nOn 12/14/2024 at 03:28 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just\ncontinue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion\nthat would take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that\ndon’t have the info required to make the determination.\nYesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You\nrefused to answer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on\nyou to check in and when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.\nI’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with\nyou, Christine.\nIf you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help\nyou both out.\nOn 12/14/2024 at 03:12 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/14/2024 at 03:14 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nQuestion for what? Alan asked if he could drop off early and I said yes.\nIf you are asking about your sarcastic comments... they are abusive.",
