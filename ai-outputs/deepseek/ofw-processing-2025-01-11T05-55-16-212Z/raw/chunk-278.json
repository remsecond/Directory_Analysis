Funny to think that is why you made me go to work for Microsoft\nmore than two decades ago. Who knew...\nMessage 123 of 287\nMax medical still outstanding. I’ve sent it multiple times now.\nThe kids health insurance and your portion has been outstanding since August. I’ll send it again.\nYou just asked for Sbux insurance numbers. I’m paying full cost of your insurance through my payroll deductions, and you’ve refused to pay me\nback.\nYou decided the inheritance from my parents was yours plus the cash gifts they sent last year which you were spending on face and hair treatments,\nfunding your fancy dinners and trip to Bali.I’m sure you won’t be sending me anything you receive from your side as inheritance in the future.\nI couldn’t ask for spousal as you had refused to work. First it was retired then voluntarily unemployed.\nI asked for larger share of assets. You said no.\nI asked for larger child support. You said no.\nI asked you bear your own spend last year and I bear mine, and you said no.
