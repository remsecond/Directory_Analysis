I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can\ndo whatever you want to him.\nI just noted earlier you had said that \"Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his\ncommunications to others, not just me.\"\nSo given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free\nwill. AD and his voice will be silent.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 05:13 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nWe agree on the fact that it was signed. I was told to review before it goes to court. That is why I want to discuss in a peaceful and constructive\nway.\nMy ears are open to any suggestions . I’m only advocating for equality between our children. That’s all- equal treatment between two brothers.\nI hope you will please consider equality over inequity.",
