I canâ€™t do it as I\nam still in the Kirkland residence.\nI would remain on existing policy, but my rate would adjust after you drop off.\nWe would then need to figure split payment of earthquake or I guess we could request that be a separate policy too and figure out payment.\nAutopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy.
