He confirmed I did not as it fell\nduring winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.\nSent:12/10/2024 at 09:47 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 09:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nOn 12/10/2024 at 07:26 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nSorry.
