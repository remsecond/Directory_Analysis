  "text": "So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about\nAdrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his\nrelationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about\nspending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he\ndoes.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost\nsomething so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if my\nparents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as they were,\nthey had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.\nMessage 34 of 287\nThank you for the update. I did not hear from him.\nNext Saturday? He would need to be home by 5:30pm.\nSent:12/06/2024 at 10:50 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/06/2024 at 01:06 PM)\nSubject:Re: Sunday Dec 8",
