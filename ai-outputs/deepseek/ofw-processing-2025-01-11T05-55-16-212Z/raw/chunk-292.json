Kari and Alan, and of course AD\nand me don’t know if plans are changing tomorrow or not.\nThat puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the\n“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.\nThis makes me feel uncomfortable.\nSent:12/13/2024 at 05:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nOn 12/13/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:40 PM)\nSubject:Re: Adrian\nI don’t know?

And go straight into a session. Just\nhearing that already sounds draining to me.",
