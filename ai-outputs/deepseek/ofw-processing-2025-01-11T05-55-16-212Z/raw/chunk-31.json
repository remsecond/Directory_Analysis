As he is 16, he only needed one parent to sign / be present.\nI could only pay with a check so I had to write against the jt Bank of America account. I’m going to transfer 250 in there now to cover for when\nthe checks are presented by the state department and King county in the next two weeks or so.\nAsking that the balance not be drawn below this amount so they checks do not bounce.\nI’m going to work on setting up my individual BofA account to allow me to write checks which currently it does not.\nMessage 31 of 287\nThere is 650 in there now - less 250 is 400. This is after you pulled out 355 for personal expenses.\nI transferred 523 out.\nSent:12/03/2024 at 05:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/04/2024 at 01:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max passport / fees\nOn 12/03/2024 at 04:59 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/04/2024 at 01:46 PM)\nSubject:Re: Max passport / fees\nIt would be - You just had $110 for transmaerica pull from it, cell was $234 and rocket money 11 after I moved my 523 out.\nSo you pulled out 355 after I transferred out 523. I may have done my math wrong and should have been owed more.",
