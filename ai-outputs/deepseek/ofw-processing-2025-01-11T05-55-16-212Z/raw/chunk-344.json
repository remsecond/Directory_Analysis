You know how much time I spend typing the words “you did not Answear the\nquestion” or “can you please reread the email” it’s honestly nuts.\nOn AD- That’s a lame excuse for needing a 30 reply long thread instead of a 30 sec phone call. The fact that you sit here and try to make it sound\nsensible is beyond me. It demonstrates what I deal with.\nQuit harassing me.\nSent:12/17/2024 at 10:41 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 12:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nOn 12/17/2024 at 10:33 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 10:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity acct - msft dividends and share deposit\nOk.

But I made up the difference in the split with a cash payment. So from there on it should be 50-50. I’m actually\nreally tired of this Christine when I can’t get a 30 sec phone call to coordinate for my kid and he has to lose 2 1/2 hours with me. This all seems\nnuts to me and your attention to detail across platforms is not where it needs to be.",
