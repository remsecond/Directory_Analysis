But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.\nMy first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?\nLet’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?\nOn 12/01/2024 at 10:47 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 10:55 AM)\nSubject:Sunday Dec 8\nDo you have timing/thoughts for the visit Sunday?\nWe don’t have details for Sunday basketball game yet but trying to understand if you might have him home prior to game or if you are thinking\ngo straight to game.\nMessage 8 of 287\nSure. And I assure you that I will work on this prior to mediation. I want us to have a crack at it.

Will discuss in mediation unless you get feedback from Lisa prior, my interpretation is correct and you will pay that amount.\nThank you\nOn 12/01/2024 at 11:04 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 02:52 PM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nThat feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands\nwith me.\nI don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.\nThats all.\nIf both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what\nhe does.",
