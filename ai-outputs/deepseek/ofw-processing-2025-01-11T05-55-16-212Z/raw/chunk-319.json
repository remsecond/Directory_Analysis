Funny to think that is why you made me go to work for Microsoft\nmore than two decades ago. Who knew...\nMessage 156 of 287\nI never had a say in a single decision for the Seahawks. I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and energy\nto document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away tickets that you\ntransferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and expectations are beyond\nastounding.\nSent:12/15/2024 at 05:50 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM)\nSubject:Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nWe split 8 games and this is left over.\nIf you want them you can pay me for my half - 264\nDo you want me to list the tickets and we split the proceeds?\nJust LMK.\nMessage 157 of 287\nIs the OFW calendar up to date?
