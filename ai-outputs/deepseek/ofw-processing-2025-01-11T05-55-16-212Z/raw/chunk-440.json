Could you send that over?\nIf you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.\nThank you.\nMessage 261 of 287\nI thought we talked on the 19th.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 08:56 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:57 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOn 12/28/2024 at 08:46 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:47 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nOFW is mode of communication between you and I as I understand.\nOn 12/27/2024 at 07:10 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2024 at 08:45 AM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nSo I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we canâ€™t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or\ncompliance folks always on the thread for personal stuff. You did not respond.\nShould I assume that moving forward we just go through lawyers from now on? My hope from the discussion on the 19th was we would begin\nto work together a little more cooperatively.

Then this landed. Going back and forth\nacross platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.\nI will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc..
