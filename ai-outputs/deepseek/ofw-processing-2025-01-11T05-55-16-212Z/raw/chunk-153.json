You have made it impossible for him to\nhave the freedom of choice that Max does at 15 until he is 18. I think my only question was about his vote. Did he vote again on his choice to give up\nthat free will until he is an adult? He’s a super smart kid and that would be odd... but if he does not want to see me and this really had nothing to do\nwith our divorce I’ll let Kari know and step away. And we will agree to disagree.\nSent:12/09/2024 at 12:53 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nOn 12/09/2024 at 12:28 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/09/2024 at 12:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nHis voice has not been silent.

I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can\ndo whatever you want to him.\nI just noted earlier you had said that \"Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his\ncommunications to others, not just me.\"\nSo given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free\nwill. AD and his voice will be silent.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 05:13 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nWe agree on the fact that it was signed. I was told to review before it goes to court. That is why I want to discuss in a peaceful and constructive\nway.\nMy ears are open to any suggestions . I’m only advocating for equality between our children. That’s all- equal treatment between two brothers.\nI hope you will please consider equality over inequity.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 05:06 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nPlease stop.
