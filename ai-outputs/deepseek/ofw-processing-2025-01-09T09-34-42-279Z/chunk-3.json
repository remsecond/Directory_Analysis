Really an awesome day. AD is just amazing. And I really love coaching his team. I’m in my element. For that\nmatter, I’ve turned a corner I think. I look great, feel great, and we have a parenting plan so all my big problems are solved.\nThat said, I did miss your voice on this special day for the first time in 29 years. Even when we talked late at night from River Oaks Parkway to\nSeymour Road. There will be a lot of firsts in our ending. That’s fine. But tbh, I still love some part of you. I don’t feel bad about it either.\nAnd you say I don’t have that kind of access to you, so that is fine. But when I pledged to love you till death do us part, I meant it. And I still do. And\neven though you hate everything about me, I know in my heart I never held malice for you. I learned wrong. Not an excuse, a reality.\nI’m not asking you for anything. And I’m entitled to my own feelings and my own reality. It’s me that we\nare talking about after all. And I know more about the how, why, and intent of my actions than anyone, even you. So I’m ok telling you I know my\ntruth. And we can both be right.\nHope when things get better I can have a rain check on my bday dinner.

It is my understanding of the current situation. But I’m not a lawyer. It was also a plea to work together so we made\nsmart fiscal decisions for the long term. My offer still stands>>\nHey-\nI was thinking about what you said about us drawing down your assets since you make more money than I do now even though we continue to pull\nfrom Fidelity the same way we always did to cover the gaps.\nHypothetically Speaking:\n- Let's say I made 5x what you made over 24 years (it was definitely more, given the stock market returns we have seen)\n- In the last year, we got my full 10-month payout, one month of vacation, and now unemployment checks. No bonus or stock.\nAs I understand in community property states, any income earned by either spouse during the marriage and all property bought with those earnings is\nconsidered community property, owned equally by both spouses. Likewise, our debts incurred during our marriage are shared debts. So while I was\nthe primary breadwinner for 24 years and am now unemployed and drawing benefits that are a fraction of your income, the wealth accumulated\nduring the years when I was the primary earner is considered joint property, regardless of who earned more. So when it comes time for us to divide\nassets, the law would look for a fair distribution that considers the entire marriage span, not just the current earning situation. So that's the 24 years I\nwas the primary breadwinner as well as the last few months you were.\nBut what I heard you say is you think you are paying all the bills now because you are the primary earner while we draw from our shared investments\n(which are 1/2 yours). So, given the status quo, how do you think that you are disproportionately contributing to our marital assets? I can understand\nyour perception from an emotional standpoint, but I don't think it aligns with the legal view of community property. Just like I can't say I was paying\nfor everything for the previous 24 years. It might feel unfair given our recent shift in financial dynamics, but I don't get how it's different with you as\nthe main breadwinner, even if the change in our roles feels abrupt or unbalanced. I feel like we just swapped roles for the last couple of months\n(though I don't think you make 4-8x what I did given my payout and unemployment benefits)\nYou worked to make us an effective team, and we could not have accumulated our nest egg without your contributions to our household. Those let\nSent:01/07/2024 at 06:17 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/07/2024 at 06:32 PM)\nSubject:You demanded I “Get a Job” and left....\n\nme focus on a high-paying job and make great investment choices in the market and real estate. But in a community asset state, the 50/50 model\ndoesn't change even when our roles are reversed. So your current earnings, my payout, and my unemployment benefits are just part of our marital\nestate. So if we are currently drawing from our joint income and investments to pay our bills, why would it be viewed as drawing solely from your\nearnings? Till we divvy everything up, everything is still the same, right? It's just you have been contributing more these last few months. The same\nway I did for the last 24 years is the way that I interpret what is going on now.\nDefinitely not trying to argue. It's just how I interpret community property until we go our own way after the divorce. And as I mentioned today, I\nreally hope we learn to be civil enough to effectively partner with financial professionals to make the best long-term decisions as a team (we both have\na good head on our shoulders). Especially when it comes to things like \"when to sell what\" wrt stock to pay the least amount of taxes as our brackets\nevolve and change. Of course, the same goes for the house and condo sale. Given the interest rate hell we are going to be dealing with, essentially\nforgoing all that we tried to do, we may not be able to reasonably buy homes for years to come.

I know I send you a lot of emails, but this is actually meaningful >>\nToday you said something critically important to closing out our relationship in a more timely way with less acrimony, possibly setting us up to teach\nthe kids something valuable as a life skill.\nThe “two things can be right” recap:\n\nchoice.\n\nwhat you asked.\nIt was an impossible dilemma. A catch 22. There are nuances and blame we both would like to disproportionally heap on each other because of the\nawful situation. And neither of us wants to bear the burden of blowing up our family.\nBut I have no desire to fight about that. We are not in a safe enough space to play with that fire yet. In good time after some healing apart we can\nconsider it.\nBut today you said “I want to tell you something I have never told you before, I endured this for twice as long as you and I have never even had a\nmoment to process”... and it made me think- this is so much more than just me involved.\nI have always made the assumption you were full steam ahead. Happy about it all and loving your decision. No concerns, you won the lottery with\nthat July 5th call- No more Big. And tbh I don’t see the collateral damage weighing on you in the least.\nSo what? Here’s what- the last six months have been sheer unadulterated hell. We have compounded our problem 10x fold. And we created our own\never worsening self fulfilling prophecy of literal doom. And we are spiraling out of control.\nWe can’t turn back time. Too much blood has been shed to forget. But, we still control our future. And we know now so much left unsaid has done\nso much damage, that we should consider doing something different moving forward.\nIn your moment of transparency and honesty I honestly understood where you were coming from. I get it. Finally a window into the black box of\ninexplicable despair that I needed desperately to understand. I even think we have a lot in common.\nThese moments, these hard, honest truths, if we open up, like we have not before, will allow us to be relatable and show vulnerability to each others\nperspective. We don’t have to be right, we just have to make an effort to understand each other.\nSent:01/08/2024 at 10:00 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:53 AM)\nSubject:Please Consider in a Quiet Moment\n\nBut to this point we have each dug in hard. There is only one POV, it’s mine, and it’s right! But that never really works. And it has proven to be even\nmore destructive than the original sin that got us into this place. We are repeating the pattern.\nBut I hope, that the two people who raised three kids and dreamed of forever can find the time to start communicating again. Perhaps show some\nhumanity for each other. And agree this was not on purpose. Blaming each other will never help us.\nWe had our reasons for making the decisions we did. But we see now that they were driven by bad data and incorrect assumptions. We stopped\ncommunicating and got it all wrong.\nI’ve made my point. And because I’m learning, and trying to get better now that I know, I am not asking for anything. I just wanted to share my\nperspective.\nIt is my hope however that after 30 years of doing a bad job on both sides of being honest and compassionate, that we consider creating a safe place.\nOne that helps us understand how we got here, in the hope we never do it again.\nYou are our cycle breaker. The hero! We have a plan now to course correct- every problem we had but this one. Lets not throw it away or minimize\nthis. Let’s take advantage of your bravery. Let’s put something positive together that leaves us with a legacy we can both be proud of and we take\nforward as a win.\nLet’s start with compassion for what the other is feeling and not start by blaming, let’s communicate honestly with each other again,  let’s give each\nother the space to heal separately without constructing a wall. And in good time let’s find a safe space and setting to compare notes and start to heal.\nMessage 327 of 4024\nSorry.

On the day she found out I finally got a place. I'm not sure what there is to discuss since our\nlast conversation at Flo. And I've been out of the loop since Cabo was canceled. Please feel free to go ahead and meet without me. I don't want to gate\non progress now that this is urgent. I trust ya!\nSent:01/09/2024 at 11:43 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 11:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: Elsa’s Wedding\nMessage 331 of 4024\nBut I do need some reassurance. I am working my ass off and trying to do right by you. I am giving it my level best to set us up for success by\nextricating myself from your space which will limit the acrimony from continuous property conversations. I am trying to help our relationship\nimprove.\nWhat I cannot stand is repeating recent history and the explosion of our marriage. I am asking you be 100% honest with me at this moment. We are\nworking well together, and it hopefully is the start of things to come. But if you are just going to tell me later, you did this to get me the fuck out of\nyour life so you can move to something new before we close this out, it will be too much for me.\nI like the way this is. I want to continue. This way has so much potential. But we know the excuses of the past and the devastation it caused us and so\nmany people who depend on us. Please tell me if you are being honest with me now, or if this is just a show again because you think I will be triggered\notherwise. I have to know this time, now that I have learned my lesson the hard way.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 12:39 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 12:42 PM)\nSubject:I don't need to be soothed...\n\nMessage 332 of 4024\nMay we please chat about this tonight? I’m struggling with the idea of this being the same thing we just did.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 02:30 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:01 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 333 of 4024\nRemind me next steps on this?\nSent:01/09/2024 at 03:02 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:20 PM)\nSubject:Microwave\nMessage 334 of 4024\nYeah, we stalled out once we digressed. I can pull a master plan together. Here is off the top of my head.\n- Install the Microwave\n- TV situation, short, medium term\n- Swap the Beds and dresser\n- Finish Kirkland move\n- Bikes resting place\n- Kitchen table move\nSo the TV I am bringing you tonight is super nice. It was going to go in my main TV room. But we can put it in yours just as well. Then we decide if\nwe just remount what I juts took down as art, or if I take that one and you get a cheaper one since it won’t be used much anyway. But not sure I want\nthat for my big TV experience. Anyway, let’s get you sorted tonight. I’ll order the replacement part. And we can decide later.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 03:32 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 03:42 PM)\nSubject:Re: Microwave\nMessage 335 of 4024\nWhen we get a moment to catch our breath we really need to get that started. We have so many that need to start running concurrently. This all feels\nso overwhelming. And we still have not reached back out to Dr Brown for Phase II guidance. I guess we can sync on all of this during “running list”.\nDo you still have that or need me to resend again?\nSent:01/09/2024 at 04:06 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 04:36 PM)\nSubject:Therapy\n\nMessage 336 of 4024\nAs you noted today, you are working while you try to do this. I would also note my whole world, everything I had worked for my entire life. My\nunmutated reality, as dependable as the laws of gravity, imploded on July 5th. And now I have to completely start my whole life over again at 57.\nEverything has been cast asunder and I start from scratch now.\nShort of losing a kid or chemical burns over 80% of my body, this is my worst possible and unthinkable reality that I could have ever imagined. So\nmuch so, that I am happy to make you a deal. Let's get through with all the treatment, all the therapy, I verify my sobriety for as long as I live, then\nyou quit your job. Travel the world, whatever you want.\nBut I get my soulmate and kids back and we are honest from now on with each other.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 05:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 05:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 337 of 4024\nEmails like this make me feel very uncomfortable and triggered.

I will never trust another human being as long as I live.\nSent:01/09/2024 at 05:44 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 05:59 PM)\nSubject:Re: I don't need to be soothed...\nMessage 339 of 4024\nOk... first off. I did not move anything into your path. Especially the brown cabinet. But I pushed some other stuff, also not moved and made room\nto move it like you wanted.\nSecond, I told you several times across several platforms things may be a little undone. That I needed time to reorganize because it was happening in\nthe fly and they leave when they leave. I can send you numerous screen captures.\nThird, I asked the kids be prepared for this. AD is asking why I would take all that stuff from the house. How can I ever use it. And the deck furniture\nSent:01/09/2024 at 07:01 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/09/2024 at 07:02 PM)\nSubject:Moving to OFW",
