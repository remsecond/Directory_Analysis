I understand that this has caused an invasion of\nyour personal privacy, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to assure you that my intention was never to monitor you or the boys in a way that would\ncompromise your privacy. I acknowledge your concerns, and in light of those, believe it would be best for us to separate any shared services, such as\nATT and Xfinity, where activity information is accessible to both of us. This will ensure you feel comfortable and secure, knowing that you are not\nunder any form of surveillance. Every account we have is shared today, so you are of course free to examine anything you’d like.\nRegarding your concerns about cameras and electronic monitoring, the Blink cameras at the front door and garage door were installed when we both\nlived in the home. They are plainly visible and serve as deterrents to potential intruders, similar to our security signs. These are the only cameras in\nplace. To explain what happened, I believe when the movers were there Tuesday with all the doors open, the wifi connection to the Blink cameras\nrefreshed.  The cameras have not worked in the past because they are too far from our wifi.  But with a clear line of sight and wifi signal, it allowed the\ncamera(s) to reconnect unexpectedly. But I can confirm I never watched a livestream. I opened an alert when it fired, reviewed move pictures of the\nhouse taken Tuesday, and various other apps and photostories (at different times) when Adrian was visiting Wednesday. I did not know he had any\nconcerns at the time, but would have addressed them immediately if I had.\nI am sorry my actions invaded your privacy. This won't happen again. There are no audio or video surveillance devices inside or outside the Kirkland\nSent:01/17/2024 at 07:31 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/17/2024 at 07:39 AM)\nSubject:Re: Monday lugg\n\nhome. Note I saw a camera connect Monday around 3:00 PM as mentioned, so am not sure what's going on, but I notified you the moment I saw it\nfor full disclosure and recommend you disconnect the camera.

I’m also available to help with any technical questions related to\nthis or data we have consented to share with service providers or one another. I want to be sure to alleviate your concerns.

You respond to words you want me to have said so you can justify a fight. It’\ns unproductive. We have to go back and forth and show you I never said it, putting the real issue on pause. Then you get pissed when you realize that,\nand cut off communication so the issue is never addressed.\nIf there was inappropriate behavior of any sort I should be alerted.

I have a ton of footage on my phone, including of the garage and foyer on the day of the move with a time date stamp.I know there is\nnothing stored. I saw an alert. Thats it. If it was you, are you even sure you were where he thought he saw you? Because it’s a *.gif so it’s pretty\nimportant. Can we please, please discuss between us so we can have an informed session. I have agreed to any and all of the restraints suggested. But it’\ns fair and will be super helpful if I know what I’m being accused of. Please let me help.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 02:47 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 02:50 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr. Brown\n\nMessage 539 of 4024\nI have requested all the footage.\nI am not going to align with your prior to communication to Dr Brown what will be discussed.\nI am also not going to gaslight Adrian.\nI would like to proceed with her evaluation of the situation and next steps.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 02:53 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 02:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Dr. Brown\nMessage 540 of 4024\nYou know there is no footage.\nI don’t want to gaslight AD either.\nUnless she knows the facts an evaluation is worthless.\nLet’s please chat first and proceed with all the facts.\nPlease partner here.

We are addressing a very serious issue right now and it has some urgency. I would like to know how to communicate with\nyou in a way that doesn’t take 24 hours to respond. Please let me know if work email is better, I’m happy to do that, but would prefer not to.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:19 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:26 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 544 of 4024\nThreats to work email are unacceptable.\nI will reach out to Dr Brown and ask for guidance\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:26 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:28 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 545 of 4024\nWait. I did not say I was threatening you. That is what you said. No big deal though.All I’m asking for is a way that we can communicate more\nquickly and effectively on our son’s mental health. I’m not trying to fight at all. But when we chat you interrupt and then hang up. We need to do\nbetter and I should have access to my son’s mental health concerns. That is all I am saying.\nAnd I’m not fighting about Dr Brown. Let’s do it. But I think the way you are mandating a unilateral mental health decision is not right. I would like\nsome way to collaborate on his mental health. It’s like if we need to make other health decisions. Or to a much lesser extent something as simple as his\nschool choice or religious freedom. But these are the types of decisions we should make together.\nThat’s all I’m saying. And I don’t want to make a fuss. So please let me know how we work collaboratively like we did so well all day in a timely\nmanner, especially for the health and welfare of our children. I’m their Dad. Until I’m not, it’s a reasonable ask.\nCan we work together please?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:35 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 546 of 4024\nThe Kirkland xfinity account was under both our names.\nI have requested updating the Kirkland Xfinity account for change of ownership to just be me under my name, my email, my cell phone.

I think we will both feel better this way. Thanks for addressing it so quickly as it gave us both\nconcerns. Please take time to review the add-ons. And I am more than happy to help you pick the right data plan. I made some great choices here and\nwould be happy to share with you so you find the right solution at the right price!

Please\ntake a moment to consider that we both should work together on mental health issues just like a decision we would make in an emergency room\nsetting. Can we work together?\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:46 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 03:47 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 549 of 4024\nI’m managing work and changing accounts.\nI can reach out to Dr Brien or you can.

I don’t want to do that. That is not the way we are expected to behave as genetic parents.\nIf you are going to proceed that way of course I am strongly frowning on the omnipotent power play suggestion.\nAnd I recognize you are balancing his mental health with your work. I guess something has to give. But I’d still like to be involved just like if we are\ndeciding to remove his appendix. So please let me know if you can make the time to discuss. Hopefully you will free up for a moment soon. I’ll make\nit work on my end.\nSent:01/19/2024 at 03:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/19/2024 at 04:02 PM)\nSubject:Re: Please unblock\nMessage 551 of 4024\nWhat is your suggestion?
