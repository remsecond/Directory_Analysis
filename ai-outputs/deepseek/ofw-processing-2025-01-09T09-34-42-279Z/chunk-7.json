I showed you in realtime.\nI missed yesterday because it was lost under the move stuff. As always I am more than happy to pee immediately to l put you at ease.\nSo please let me know and I’m happy to ease any concerns with the parenting plan requirements. That is never up for debate in my mind.\nSpeaking of, as you are requesting plan compliance, are we using it? Just want to set mutual expectations. Are we both following? Let me know.\nMy attorney should have offered my help yesterday. I would still love to provide it. I really want you to feel at ease. Please take my offer to help!\nI so want to bury the hatchet with the woman I choose as my lifelong soulmate 30 years ago. Please let me know how given this limitation.\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:52 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 01:38 PM)\nSubject:Re: Packages / Items\nAttachments:IMG_1038.PNG (5 MB)\nMessage 746 of 4024\nThe whole point of our numerous discussions this AM was because I was trying to figure out final plans for Alki. I told you that. I still don’t know.\nHow can we reach resolution on these things in under 5 hours. Because now I’m heading back to Bellevue because you never followed up after I\nasked.\nIf this is the only way to work together. Please make it “work”\nSent:01/25/2024 at 12:58 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/25/2024 at 01:37 PM)\nSubject:Re: Alki\nMessage 747 of 4024\nTried to set this up today.
