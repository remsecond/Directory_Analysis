All I asked was the info you just provided. That seems easy. But you choose to ignore it in two places and then go to\nblast. In the future it might be easier just to answear a simple question than to start making assumptions and making demands.\nAny chance we can actually agree to read each other’s question and see if we can just answer it first next time? I think that was Dr Browns suggestion\ntoday as well. Behaving the exact same way, just on another platform won’t really buy us much.

And I realize during the school year, that’s the schedule.\nSo no issues. It’s your time.\nThen our plan says: “Spring Break and Winter Break should be alternated via even and odd years so that each parent has one of the breaks every year.”\nWe are on winter break.\nThen for the actual holiday event we rotate Eve vs. Day. But given the plan, it seems I am getting the school allotted days while they are on break. Is\nthat intentional?\nTBH- spring and winter are nowhere near the same (I think) so not sure the plan really accounts for our real world. And next winter I don’t really\nexpect two full weeks - Xmas day.\nIt just seems ill conceived and we are making up some weird hybrid. Most importantly - I AM NOT bitching. This is not a knock. You have been very\nhelpful. But it’s not the plan, right?\nPlease, please, don’t take it as fighting or snarky. Just tell me I’m wrong if you think I am. But the first pass through the calendar is going to be a\nlearning experience for us.\nThank you!\nSent:12/28/2023 at 04:59 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 05:03 PM)\nSubject:Winter Break (not urgent)\nMessage 117 of 4024\nThat was part of the plan I planned to discuss with you. Given we are in Phase 1, I don’t believe that counts yet but we can debate more in the call\ntomorrow at 9am.\nMax is definitely something we need to discuss given the reunification therapy.\nAnyway. Let’s save for tomorrow discussion as we will not solve on this thread tonight.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 05:07 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 05:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Winter Break (not urgent)\n\nMessage 118 of 4024\nI agree with everything you said below. And I plan to continue to work constructively with you. I hope you and I can start to heal from this craziness\nand communicate better in all of our best interests.\nI really hope we can get to co-parents and even better at some point. I am going to try extra hard to use my own internal “snark meter”.

I thought it was an intentional feature.\nYou must have thought I was honestly psycho. I get it now, but I was super confused before.\nSo... when we are comfortable we can sit side by side and compare notes to see how we both have the same experience. We have rules that will help\nanyway so maybe it’s not relevant but I totally understand where you were coming from.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 06:21 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 06:53 PM)\nSubject:OFW (not urgent)\nMessage 120 of 4024\nI’ve been thinking about this more and have some ideas of how we might do this. It will require you to help and even some teamwork, but if you\nbelieve Max should have a healthy relationship with his Father I hope that won’t be an issue.\nI’d like to share them with you tomorrow and hope you will approach with an open mind with a goal of getting the entire family a bit more “re-\nunified” since the events of July 5th.\nThis has been a real struggle and has only gotten worse, but given we know we are getting a divorce and will lead separate lives, I hope we can do right\nbe the kids and each other and take a healthy approach once the parenting plan is in place.\nLooking forward to a constructive conversation.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:22 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:23 PM)\nSubject:Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\nMessage 121 of 4024\nI am open to hear what your thoughts are in our discussion tomorrow.\nSent:12/28/2023 at 08:24 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/28/2023 at 08:30 PM)\nSubject:Re: Thoughts on Max (for tomorrow)\n\nMessage 122 of 4024\nYou are very kind.

I am\nadmitting I am powerless and am praying to my higher power to show me the way to have a peaceful and constructive conversation this morning,\nbeing thoughtful with my actions and words, and treating you with the respect and dignity you deserve.\nThis, while I ask for grace, cooperation, and maybe even some measure of forgiveness that should not be afforded to me. I pray that we find a way for\nthat being clear eyed that forgiveness does not mean forgetting. And in our case, it specifically means that destructive words and deeds are never\nappropriate, normalized, or permitted again.\nI promise I will try and do my best by you and the family as we have a difficult conversation in an effort to start a long healing process and\nreunification together. I pray my thoughts and words are guided with best intentions rather than self service, in the best interest of all. I wish you the\nbest and that your higher power guides you in the way that is right and appropriate for you as well.\nSent:12/29/2023 at 04:58 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/29/2023 at 06:52 AM)\nSubject:Good Morning and Grace to You (no response necessary)\nMessage 124 of 4024\nPhase 1\n- Max: Saturday Night dinners (every other weekend)\n- Adrian: Saturday 9am - Sunday 7pm (every other weekend).
