It just makes things hard on\nyou and it seems and we fight. That is unfair to us imho.\nI guess in the business world, I would not wait till the night before Chinese New Year to send a critical, large, time consuming request to my\ncolleagues in Beijing. Anna Lisa should confirm what I said. I made sure she knew of Lisa’s plans two weeks ago.\nBut I’m not trying to pick a fight. Please don’t take it that way.\nI am not sure what the enrollment for Max entails but assume it is just affirmation that he will continue at SAAS.\nfwiw- i think I have several relevant docs your should see for tax and estate planning but I think that is a forbidden conversation?\nSent:01/26/2024 at 08:51 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:18 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!\nMessage 812 of 4024\nPer your request, please see attached. I\nObviously, it does not say \"I beat you,\" it says I am a \"credible threat to the physical safety of you, Max and Adrian\" with a history of showing I will do\nthat and will again. I am not trying to fight this assertion. That would make this situation even worse and be further evidence to be used against me. I\njust thought we were focused on digital communications and physical proximity to the house. This feels awful to have to sign and say I agree to.

Ever...\nPer the attached, you and Anna Lisa are saying:\n- There is a Serious Concern for Safety: The court believes that there is a legitimate and convincing reason to be concerned for the safety of the\nprotected person. This is not a speculative or unfounded fear; it's based on credible evidence of similar incidents.\n- Physical Safety at Risk: The focus of this statement is on the physical safety of the protected persons. It demonstrates that the court has a real and\ndemonstrated reason to believe the restrained person will cause physical harm to the persons ordered to be protected.\n- Justification for Restraining Order: This finding is the key factor in the court's decision to issue the restraining order. It justifies the need for legal\nprotection because there is a clear and demonstrated pattern and history of physical abuse from the target of the order.\n- Increased Vigilance and Enforcement: With such a clause in place, law enforcement and the court are likely to be more vigilant in enforcing the\norder. Violations will be treated with greater seriousness given the perceived risk to physical health and safety of the protected.\n- Potential Impact on Other Provisions: This clause will influence other aspects of the restraining order, such as restrictions on proximity,\ncommunication restrictions, and other specific behaviors. The proven threat of bodily harm makes the request highly credible.\n- It's important the restrained person and the protected person understand the very serious implications of this clause. The restrained person must be\naware of the seriousness of the situation and the need to strictly adhere to the terms of the order to avoid legal consequences.\n- The protected person should understand they are asking for this level of risk mitigation and can demonstrate a history of this behavior so the court\ncan take all necessary precautions for the physical safety of those being protected given its likelihood of happening again.\nMessage 813 of 4024\nJust to reiterate, I am not trying to physically threaten you or the kids in any way as noted in the RO or with this communication. If you feel quoting\nthe RO you sent, along with the associated research, is a threat, please let me know immediately.\nIf so, I promise to address your concerns immediately with my attorney and the court to reassure you, the kids, and the court that I am not\nthreatening physical or sexual violence now, or ever. Even if you think it is likely to happen in the future.\nYou just asked me to \"Show me where it says that. I’m assuming you went over the RO with lawyers.\" So, I'm trying to accommodate my\ninterpretation of your ask, understanding you did this with your lawyer with a clear intent and purpose.\nI will never physically or sexually abuse you or my children. If asked to sign something implying, I have and am likely to do it again, to keep you from\npursuing much more serious courses of action against me, I am just registering my concerns.\n-robert\nSent:01/26/2024 at 09:53 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:19 AM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Will I beat you fork>>\nMessage 814 of 4024\nThank you for the update and explanation.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 10:18 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 10:34 AM)\nSubject:Re: SoberLink\n\nMessage 815 of 4024\nI have a lot of questions and concerns about some of the content below and the moves I am making that you may not be aware of. I also have some\nthings that you should have that impact things like our taxes. I would not want to violate the RO however.\nI just don't know how this will work without at least a little planning and logistics coordination. I feel we will stumble over each other and may end\nup using something that the other has plans for. Or one of us may be unaware the other has a pipeline move waiting to execute.\nAnyway, as mentioned, you guys know Lisa is gone for the next two weeks and has several additional dates on the calendar for out-of-state trials and\nother engagements. I'm looking at our numbers and am afraid we are going to crash and burn without coordination.\nEven if we had some sort of approved \"running list\" meeting with strict ground rules it would go a long way. I am trying to assure you that I will be on\nmy Monday behavior (and would have continued if I was not blackballed Monday PM) But this is the last time I'll say this.\nFingers crossed because I'm making moves, and I am sure you are too. I feel we are flying without a net and unless my subject line is always \"Our Kids\nInheritance\" as a way to address, we are taking an enormous risk to our fiscal viability before mediation.\nI'm in your hands. Have a great day. I'm out!\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:12 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 12:27 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 816 of 4024\nThank you for the note. Agree the whole thing is frustrating especially around financial aspects.\nI didn’t see a confirmation on xfinity alerts that would be helpful so I know what you continue to have visibility to but I can address through lawyers\nif you will not share.\nLet me think about periodic connects to align that don’t violate the RO on either side.\nMax has a cold as do many of his classmates.\nI’ll send Jonathan and email as I didn’t see a response in that piece either.\nLooking forward to a more civil and cooperative relationship and tone in our communications.\nSent:01/26/2024 at 12:31 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 01/26/2024 at 12:32 PM)\nSubject:Re: We Can Do This!!!  <<Outstanding Issues Fork>>\nMessage 817 of 4024\nI have not seen one today.
