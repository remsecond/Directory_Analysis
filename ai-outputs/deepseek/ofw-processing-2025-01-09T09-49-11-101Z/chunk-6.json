Feel free to divvy up community stuff as mentioned but my private things, my clothes, things in the dresser, things in\nmy areas of the closet, etc... are my private things. We have agreed we would show each other dignity and respect and\nacknowledge the other's space. So please do not go through, move, or otherwise mess with my personal things. I would\nnever do that to you, and in fact, did not even fix the GFI when you were gone because I was respectful of your clothes, and\nI would have to move them to do it. So I made a temp fix and told you I would wait till you returned. As I said, I'm sure you\nwould never touch my private things and then expect me to respect yours, but it's worth noting, given how nuts this has\nbecome and your ability to adhere to the same rules.
