There is no place to do that. It looks like you\nalmost have to use it specifically to \"pay a bill\". There is nowhere to enter a routing number. Only a place to look up names\nfor people you may owe money to. It may be limited on purpose, but I am sure we can figure something out.\nThoughts:\nI'll keep this up, so we can count on just under ~1k a week from it\nWe can have me pay a bill or happy to see if I can give you access\nWe could also just withdraw cash and move it that way I also assume\nMaybe we sit together and you tell me how you want to handle it w\n\nSubject: Unemployment Benefits\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nTo: Christine Moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nDate Sent: Tuesday, November 7, 2023 1:56:51 PM GMT-08:00\nLast night I thought you said, \"you have not even signed up for unemployment\". Maybe I misheard, as I am sure you know I\nhave. I was sitting on the couch with you, and we discussed it as I did it. Either way, I have, and as I understand, while we\nare still pooling everything, that needs to go to pay our bills. We get ~1k a week, and obviously, I have not touched a dime.\nPlease let me know where I need to move it (BOFA routing number?) so you can use it for our expenses and I will try and\nset that up. Or I can provide the account info to you if that is more helpful. If we can't figure that out, you gave me the ATM\ncard where it is stored, and I assume we can just withdraw it and deposit it. Regardless, it's still the family's income\n(correct?)\nIt's all there, but the website is down, or I'd share the balance screenshot.
