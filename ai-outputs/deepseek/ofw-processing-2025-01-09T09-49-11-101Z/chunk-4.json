Not complaining or bothering you at all...\nGood A\u0000ernoon, Ms Be\u0000s-\nChris\u0000ne and I have made enough progress on the paren\u0000ng plan that we would like to re-engage if you s\u0000ll have space for\nus. I think the recommenda\u0000on is for the kids to have their own individual therapy, and our oldest (Max) will also\npar\u0000cipate with me in reunifica\u0000on therapy. Addi\u0000onally, there is a litany of other therapies we will be involved with that I\nam a\u0000aching, so you have a holis\u0000c picture of our mental health ac\u0000vi\u0000es. Those are in the paren\u0000ng plan, so we need to\ncomply with them, but we are also open to any recommenda\u0000ons you have as you learn more about our children and\nsitua\u0000on.\nThis is all a new learning experience for us, and we welcome it, but the lack of a \"general contractor\" across the family's\nmental health efforts creates a challenge. I do like the sugges\u0000ons you have provided below, and I would like to move\nforward with an intake session. Admi\u0000edly, Chris\u0000ne and I have struggled recently, and nerves can fray, but we will be on\nour best behavior. The reason I men\u0000on it, however, is I am not sure if 30 min will be enough vs. an hour.

I acknowledge your earlier message\nthat this is all in the drafting phase and revisions will still be made. I also note that my comments may seem overly pedantic.\nBut I'd rather be thorough and put my thoughts out there than just ignore them and wonder if I should have mentioned them\nlater.\nI don't say anything in the comments I would not say in front of Christine, so I am happy to discuss them together in the\nappropriate and safe setting if you desire. I'd want to address these thoughts with her anyway. Lastly, please don't take my\ntone as combative; that is not my intent. I fear 30 years in tech have translated into a style that does not work well in divorce\ncommunications.\nChristine is a great person. She has good intentions.

Max has the choice to stay overnight at Robert’s house whenever he wants, but should not feel\npressure from either parent as to what he decides.

Most\nnotably, the things Chris\u0000ne is currently doing or has done in December seem like low-hanging fruit.\n\nTelephone Access: We should ensure that parents and children can call each other regularly, regardless of which\nparent the children are staying with. For example, Chris\u0000ne has the kids at an unknown loca\u0000on in California. I\nswapped a text with Adrian. He replied it was very awkward even to swap a quick text given his situa\u0000on.\nParents/Children’s Contact Info: We should expect each parent to inform the other with their contact details. I have\nChris\u0000ne's phone number; she has the kids out of state tonight but won't provide addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on. That does\nnot seem reasonable. We should share addresses and contact info in case of an emergency.\nParental Behavior and Defama\u0000on: We should specify we should not speak nega\u0000vely about the other or present a\nnega\u0000ve picture to our children's friend's parents. This happened recently, and Robert has been presented as unsafe\nto our children's best friends. This will indirectly impact the kids and who they can spend \u0000me with.\nFlexibility of Schedule: Given that Chris\u0000ne plays ski bus, Robert is a sports coach, and there are going to be other\nsitua\u0000ons like this, it would be nice and appropriate to be able to swap days/du\u0000es if both are amenable to the\nexchange. It should not be used to take advantage of a situa\u0000on and always feel mutually beneficial.\nNo Waiver: We should clarify that being flexible with the paren\u0000ng plan does not waive either parent's rights. We\nshould s\u0000ck to the plan with a well-defined protocol similar to the email guidelines that define how we propose\ndevia\u0000ons from the plan. This includes proposal format, expected response \u0000me,  and verifica\u0000on method.\nNo Condi\u0000oning Performance: We should not permit condi\u0000oning of some aspects of the paren\u0000ng plan on another\naspect.\nChris\u0000ne and I should not insist on complying with one part of the plan unless another part is sa\u0000sfied. We\nwant to ensure that each aspect of the paren\u0000ng plan is respected and followed independently of each other.\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Sunday, December 17, 2023 8:21 PM\nTo: Lisa Ann Sharpe <sharpe@lasher.com>\nCc: Vanessa G.
