They often will swap, mount, and move crap if you\nare nice and ask with a \"just tell me if you can't\". Remember, they are paid by the hour so  if they can get more time in while\nthey are stationed and not moving they seem to understand the math.\nSugges\u0000ons for Monday move are noted in GREEN and roughly priori\u0000zed.

I think we have a good enough handle on things to call it a move. We will certainly need a couple more trips. And\nmaybe even one from the beach.\nI really hope you are pleased with all that I got done there in Alki.
