I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2.

I’m trying to navigate if I sell\nstock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.\nMessage 113 of 287\nSo this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first meetings\nwith Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like you\nknew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been used\nfor Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and you\nmanaged those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it came\nto dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC, and\nensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. The\nkids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard\nto build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this\ndiscussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nSent:12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?\nThen it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.\nIf you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.",
