But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like\nretaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:\n• Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.\n• The portrayal to Adrian that I \"won't reply\" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.\n• Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.\n• The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 10:48 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:Re: AD is asleep",
