I am offering for us to do it. I want to turn over a new leaf. I have said that I will work with you. I don’t want to disrupt plans and think we\ncan figure something reasonable out that benefits the children. Are you just refusing to take that offer for peaceful resolution?\nOn 12/10/2024 at 11:04 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 11:20 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nI pulled from mid winter break language.

And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't\nhelp us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.\nThe SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the\nregular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.",
