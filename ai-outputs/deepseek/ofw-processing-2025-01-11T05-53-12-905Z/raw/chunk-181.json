And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't\nhelp us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.\nThe SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the\nregular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.\nLet's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?\nOn 12/10/2024 at 09:56 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 09:56 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nThe holidays take priority over regular time.\nSo if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.\nIf you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.\nI would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys\nover Winter Break.\nOn 12/10/2024 at 09:48 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 09:52 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nThat was not communicated.
