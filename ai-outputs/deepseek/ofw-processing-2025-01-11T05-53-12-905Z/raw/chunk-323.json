I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and\nenergy to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away\ntickets that you transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and\nexpectations are beyond astounding.\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 05:46 PM)\nSubject:Seahawks Tickets - Dec 22\nWe split 8 games and this is left over.\nIf you want them you can pay me for my half - 264\nDo you want me to list the tickets and we split the proceeds?\nJust LMK.\nMessage 163 of 287\nChristine, I have done everything humanly possible to work with you. If you have a suggestion of something I did not do please bring it up with me.\nOur history is replete  with me asking to turn the page, do something new together to work on behalf of the kids, at least for their mental health.\nI stressed this again on the 10th. But you were busy with girls night as your priority. Then I followed up last week addressing every concern you had.\nNow we have 35 response long OFW thread trying to figure out AD’s time instead of a 30 second phone call. He missed Kari and went home early.\n“Let me think about it,” that’s all you have said for over a year. My assumption is that it will go for many more years. Nothing changes with you.\nI am always nice in front of AD, I don’t scream or wag my finger “we are at war.” That’s not good for him. I want him to love the part of them that is\nyou.\nHow would you like to handle tonight? Do we show him that we put him first? That’s what I would propose. You have seen I do that. Your call.\nSent:12/15/2024 at 06:24 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 11:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball\nOn 12/15/2024 at 05:59 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/15/2024 at 06:04 PM)\nSubject:Re: Basketball\nYour words to me are so aggressive, then in person you act like you are this nice guy.\nThe contrast is very scary.",
