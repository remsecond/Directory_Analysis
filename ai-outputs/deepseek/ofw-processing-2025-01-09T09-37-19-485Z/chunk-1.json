This shift allows us to rise above the day-to-day turmoil and see the\nbigger picture, helping us collect thoughts and make better, more informed decisions.\nIt's important to remember why we're here today. Christine and I chose not to involve a\nGuardian ad Litem or parental evaluator, believing that avoiding these processes would spare\nour children undue stress and expedite a resolution. Christine and I agreed it would be in Max\nand Adrian's best interests to have a plan in place sooner, one we could both agree on.\nI'm often asked why I didn't seek a court order to enforce a parenting plan. The answer is that I\nhad Christine's word that we would follow professional advice. I believed her repeatedly. But\nshe delayed the process, rejected multiple plans, changed lawyers, and postponed the\ninvolvement of a parental evaluator. There was always a reason to ignore and delay the plan.\nA week ago today,  with Jennifer, Adrian reaffirmed his desire to spend more time with me under\nthe    conditions we discussed with Kari on 8/17. We had the opportunity to implement these\nsafeguards during last    week’s Seahawks game and enjoy the opportunity, but Christine said no\nto Adrian’s wishes, and her control of the children intensified. Days after a cardio ER visit for\nMax  , she even refused to share contact details for their caregiver . Things are getting worse.\nMoving forward, it's crucial to evaluate whether the status quo, reinforced by a false narrative,\nshould remain our starting point. Allowing this distorted reality to persist only harms Max and\nAdrian by eroding the trust in our relationship. Christine's pattern of control, disregard for\nprofessional advice, and violations of recent court orders show she operates with impunity.\nUnfortunately, repeated falsehoods have created an \"illusory truth effect\" within our family,\ndistorting reality, and undermining trust. Her rejection of professional guidance for unilateral\ndecisions has severely damaged Max and Adrian's relationship with their father.\nThis document chronicles the consequences of our parenting plan negotiations, highlighting\nmultiple instances where Christine disregarded expert advice, absent any safety concerns on\nbehalf of the professionals we work with, resulting in a number of terrible consequences:\n• Erosion of trust within our family unit and a false portrayal of me as an unsafe father\n• Profound compromise of Max and Adrian's emotional and psychological well-being\n\nAs their father, it’s incredibly painful to witness how the continuous rejection of professional\nadvice and resulting alienation from me has strained our relationship and left our kids\nvulnerable at a time when they need stability and support the most. And while adhering to\nprofessional guidance isn’t a legal formality at this time, this should be about safeguarding our\nchildren’s best interests. That is not happening. Their best interests are being ignored.\nProfessional Recommendations\nYurushka Martin: Discernment Counseling\nDiscernment counseling was intended to help Christine and me navigate the initial stages of our\nseparation with a focus on the well-being of our children, Max and Adrian. Unfortunately, the\ncounseling quickly diverged from its purpose. Within minutes of the first meeting, Christine and\nYurushka shifted focus to a domestic violence strategy that was concealed from me. Hopping on\na private phone call, they began derailing our    efforts to foster a collaborative, stable\nenvironment for our family. Despite the detour, we continued under the premise of creating a\nsafe and loving environment for the children. The critical agreements included:\nThe Agreed-Upon Plan\n• Scheduled Family Dinners: Regularly scheduled family dinners should be arranged to foster\nstability and create trust for the children's benefit. We will mutually agree upon the dates,\nideally incorporating one weekday and one weekend.\n• Living Arrangements: To ensure safety, welfare, and peace of mind for all parties involved, it\nis crucial to establish clear and mutually agreed-upon guidelines for interactions and visits to\nthe shared residences over the next 3-N months. This arrangement is not a legal\nabandonment of the abode but a peace offering to foster a secure and harmonious\nenvironment.\n• Scheduled Visits Only: Any visit to the residences requires prior approval from the other\nparty, with no exceptions. The home must remain a safe and secure space for everyone\nthere. Violations may warrant police involvement if necessary.\n• Purpose of Visits: Requests for visits must be related to child-centric activities, such as family\ndinners, sports, pickups, shared chores, etc. Visits should solely focus on the well-being and\nengagement of the children. They are not used for a time for just us.\n• Respect and Privacy: Respect for each other's space is paramount. Knock on closed doors\nand don't touch each other's belongings. Act as a guest and respect each other's privacy and\n\n• Duty to Report: Christine said Yurushka explained her \"duty to report.\" as a licensed\ntherapist. So, if Yurushka has reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected\nor is in imminent danger of harming themselves or others, she is legally required to report\nthis to the appropriate authorities.\nWhat Happened\nChristine repeatedly disregarded the plan despite the clear agreements made during our\nsessions with Yurushka. She canceled or excluded me from scheduled family dinners,\nundermining our efforts to create stability for Max and Adrian. Additionally, Christine\nintentionally misrepresented my temporary sleep arrangements as abandonment, which led to\nfurther unilateral decisions that violated our agreed-upon living arrangements. Visits that were\nsupposed to be child-centric became sources of conflict, with Christine refusing necessary\napproval or using them to create discord. Yurushka did enormous damage to us early on by\ntriangulating with Christine and helping establish a precedent that Christine was omnipotent.\nObservation\nChristine’s refusal to adhere to the agreed-upon plan during what was supposed to be\ndiscernment counseling but turned into a personal agenda, significantly disrupted the stability\nwe were trying to establish for our children. As I did my level best, her unilateral decisions\nundermined our efforts to foster trust and security for Max and Adrian and led to conflicts that\nmade it harder to maintain a collaborative co-parenting relationship. The ongoing dismissal of\nprofessional advice that    continues to challenge our ability to prioritize our children began here.\n\nDebbie Bayer: Effective Co-Parenting\nFollowing our challenging and secretive sessions with Yurushka Martin, we sought to re-\nestablish stability through Debbie Bayer's guidance, hoping to overcome the obstacles that had\nemerged in our co-parenting efforts. She had been seeing us since 2019 and knew my history of\naddiction well. We chose her because she has always been extremely hard on me, as she should\nbe.\nOur engagement with Debbie marked our second attempt to establish a balanced and\ncooperative parenting plan following the attempt at discernment counseling. Debbie’s role was\nto guide us through the complexities of co-parenting during the holidays and beyond, focusing\non creating a stable and supportive environment for our children, Max, and Adrian.\nUnfortunately, this attempt further highlighted a troubling pattern: the continued disregard for\nprofessional advice, which only deepened the challenges in our co-parenting relationship.\nWhen Christine quit going to counseling because she no longer wanted to co-parent with me,\nDebbie forecasted every event that    happened till today with clairvoyant accuracy- all of this  .\n\nThe Agreed-Upon Plan\nDuring sessions with Debbie, several key agreements were established to ensure the holiday\nseason would be a time of stability and joy for the children despite the    ongoing separation:\n• Christine does not feel safe with joint holiday visits and celebrations at this time, so Robert\nis not invited to spend time with his family.\n• Robert will find accommodation that is large enough to accommodate separate holiday\ncelebrations for December.\n• The kids and Robert will work on establishing \"new traditions\" so the kids can begin to\nadjust to their new normal.\n• We agreed that one of us would get Christmas Eve and the other Christmas Day as part of\nthis arrangement.\n• Christine said Debbie explained her \"duty to report.\" as a licensed therapist. If Debbie has\nreasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected or is in imminent danger of\nharming themselves, she is legally required to report this to the appropriate authorities.\nWhat Happened\nDespite the clear plan established with Debbie Bayer to ensure a stable holiday season for our\nchildren, Christine unilaterally imposed a \"no driving and no overnights\" policy without\nsubstantiated reasons. Christine arranged for the children to stay with friends during her work\ntravels, implying that I was an unsafe caregiver to our friends despite Debbie not reporting any\nsafety concerns. She cited a vague \"legal strategy\" to justify her new restrictions, directly\ncontradicting Debbie's recommendations. This was a huge change in our visitation plan.\nInstead of working together to help Max and Adrian adjust to their “new normal,” Christine\nundermined our agreed holiday schedule, taking them on a surprise five-star vacation to\nCalifornia for theme park tours. Fortunately, Dr Brown stepped in, and we adopted her\nparenting plan for the last days of December. Christine took both days after we agreed to split\nChristmas Eve/Day with Dr. Brown. I did, however, get    an encore Christmas Day with the kids.\nObservation\nChristine's pattern of unilateral decision-making during this phase further disrupted our co-\nparenting efforts. Ignoring Debbie Bayer's professional advice strained my relationship with Max\nand Adrian and hindered their adjustment to new family traditions.\nShe doubled down on disregarding the Holiday Plans by not allowing me to see them and taking\nthem to expensive resorts, flying 1\nst\nclass, and then lavishing them with expensive gifts. Her\ndisregard for expert guidance and flaunting her   contempt for our agreements weakened the\ntrust and stability our children need, amplifying concerns about her underlying motivations.\n\nDr Monique Brown: Defining the Parenting Plan\nDespite Debbie Bayer's attempts to foster cooperation during the holiday season, the ongoing\nissues necessitated the involvement of Dr. Monique Brown, whose structured approach aimed\nto bring clarity and fairness to our parenting plan. In her words, her mission was to “make us\nboth equally unhappy.” She would define our parenting plan now. I asked to conduct this\nexercise with Jennifer Kellin, who provided us with excellent sample work products. Christine’s\nattorney pushed hard for Dr. Brown instead, so we went with her as a gesture of good faith.\nThe involvement of Dr. Monique Brown represented a pivotal moment in our parenting plan\nnegotiations. Dr. Brown was tasked with creating a structured and phased approach designed\nto balance the needs of our children, particularly Adrian, while ensuring a fair and cooperative\nco-parenting arrangement. We spent months with Dr. Brown from December to March, and the\nparenting plan was revisited several times but was unchanged, taking many meetings with the\nentire family and my history of addiction and verbal abuse into account  .\nAfter adopting her plan for a few weeks, Christine rejected Dr. Brown’s professional advice and\ncontradicted our children's expressed desires as part of her    legal strategy. Adrian asked to see\nme on numerous occasions, but her refusal to honor the agreed-upon plan led to the collapse of\nour sixth attempt at a parenting plan. This further alienated me from my children and\nexacerbated the growing disconnect between their best interests and Christine’s narrative.\nThe Agreed-Upon Plan\nDr. Brown proposed a clear, phased approach to help transition our family into a stable,\nsupportive co-parenting arrangement. The plan was structured into two phases:\nPhase I:\n• Starts immediately and concludes upon both: (1) full compliance with Soberlink\nrequirements under Section 14.\n• Max: If Max chooses, Father will have a dinner visit in a location of Max's choice every week\nand can stay overnight at Robert's house or spend additional time whenever he wants.\n• Adrian: Adrian will reside with Robert every other weekend from Saturday 9 am until\nSunday 8 pm and an after-school visit every Wednesday.\nPhase II:\n• The children will reside with Robert every other weekend from Friday at 3 pm to Monday at\n8 pm and every Wednesday from 3 pm until Thursday at 8 pm.\n\n• The parents agree that after 3 months in Phase II, the parties will agree to schedule a\nmediation to address the issue of if/when Adrian moves to a 50-50 week-on, week-off\nresidential schedule.\n• The Summer Schedule is the same as the School Schedule except each parent shall spend\ntwo (2) weeks, which may be taken together (7 consecutive overnight blocks or 14-day\nblock) of uninterrupted vacation time.\n• The children shall not go more than 14 days without seeing the other parent.\n• Unless there are extraordinary considerations related to the father's proposed vacation\nlocation, the mother will not object or seek to prevent the vacation from transpiring at all.\n• Christine said Dr. Brown explained her \"duty to report\" as a licensed therapist. So, if Dr.\nBrown has reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected or is in imminent\ndanger of harming themselves or others, she is legally required to report this to the\nappropriate authorities.\nWhat Happened\nDespite Dr. Brown's structured and phased approach to helping our family transition into a\nstable co-parenting arrangement, Christine repeatedly refused to honor the agreed-upon plan,\ndismissing Dr. Brown's qualifications for her internet research and legal guidance. We went\nback to Dr. Brown three times at Christine’s request. None of the plans satisfied Christine in the\nend  , and while we agreed to a 60/40 split, the breaking point was my ask for the path to 50/50.\nChristine decided to take her ball and go home. So, instead of being at either 60/40 or 50/50\nwith a whole summer of shared activities, my contact with the children was severely limited—\nno overnights, no driving, and only six hours together for the entire month of July. What should\nhave been a summer filled with meaningful bonding time in a house I can’t afford but rented\nfor us to do that, was reduced to a few hours with one child and a false reality.\nObservation\nChristine's dismissal of Dr. Brown's professional advice and the agreed-upon plan disrupted the\nstability our children needed and damaged our co-parenting relationship. By rejecting a plan  ,\nwhich we had adopted for weeks that posed no safety risks, according to Dr Brown, Christine\ndistanced the children from me, deepening the disconnect between their best interests and her\nactions. Her gatekeeping ignored the children’s emotional well-being and prohibited effective\n\nKari Betts:  Child Therapist\nDuring the collapse of our sixth attempt at a parenting plan under Dr. Brown, the kids began to\nsee  Kari Betts, whose role was crucial in continuing the efforts to create a supportive\nenvironment for our children. She was very intentional in saying that she would not be involved\nin the parenting plan in any way and would offer no opinions on the matter. She was strictly\nthere on behalf of the kids to ensure they had a voice during this awful time.\nThe introductory meeting with Kari Betts was intended to see how the kids reacted to Dr.\nBrown's recommendations, ensuring that Christine and I could work collaboratively. to prioritize\nthe well-being of our children, particularly Adrian. However, in a 1st meeting with the three of\nthem without me, Christine decided what she heard, albeit different from what Kari reported,\ngave her grounds to abandon Dr. Brown’s plan altogether and cut off all visitation from me.\nThe\nNot Agreed-Upon Plan\nDr Brown  ’s plan should have guided our actions during this phase and should have continued\nwith no justifiable reasons to stop. However, after their private meeting, the following occurred.\n• \"As of now,\nI can really only recall making safety plan recommendations -  like safety check-\nins and what to do if he identifies high on the scale and needs additional support\n. This same\nsafety plan applies until our next session. We can readdress it at the next session and see if\nwe want to make any adjustments to it then. Unless, you think further supportive measures\nare needed at this time?\" – Kari Betts, Wednesday, 03/20/2024\n• \"Conversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he\ncommunicated to her in an honest and open environment was incredibly brave and\nI need to\nrespect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made\nit clear to me if she believes he is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That\nis her obligation.\" – Christine Moyer, Wednesday, 03/20/2024\n• Despite the contradictions above,\nChristine made the unilateral decision to disregard Dr.\nBrown's plan and end all visitation between the children and myself\ndespite continued\nprofessional recommendations to proceed with Phase I for the benefit of the children.\nWhat Happened\nThis was a unilateral decision of enormous consequence.    It was an almost unthinkable swing\nfrom co-parenting to total isolation for the kids and me. So, after learning that Christine had\nbeen in the room with Adrian during the initial session, a fact she initially denied, I requested a\nfollow-up meeting to clarify what had occurred. This follow-up meeting was tense and revealed\nsignificant differences in how the meeting was perceived and the information that was\nconveyed. Kari stuck by her account, and there was no safety risk identified from me by her.\n\nDespite the clear guidance from both Dr. Brown and Kari Betts, Christine unilaterally\ndisregarded the agreed-upon plan we had in place and ended it, leading to the complete\ntermination of all visitations between Adrian and me, positioning me as an unsafe parent.\nObservation\nChristine's unilateral actions during this phase disrupted our parenting plan and eroded the\ntrust within our family. Ignoring professional advice and justifying her decisions with\ncontradictory reasoning further distanced Max and Adrian from me, compromising their\nemotional well-being. Her behavior, including claiming safety concerns about me while allowing\nme to coach and volunteer with other children at their schools and on their sports teams,\nundermines her own story, our co-parenting efforts, and the stability our children need.\n\nKari Betts: Adrian’s Requested Meeting\nPrior meetings with Kari exposed Christine's misuse of the therapeutic process in our complex\nsituation. Before his upcoming Hong Kong trip, Adrian urgently requested a joint session with\nKari and me, hoping to address issues between us and improve the relationship we had\ndevolved into. Notably, the previous year, after a huge fight with Elsa and meeting with her\nmother, Christine told the children that they would be divorcing me upon their return.\nI asked to have the meeting before Hong Kong, but the request was denied despite its clear\nsignificance. A meeting was eventually scheduled after their return. Unfortunately, it was done\nwithout my knowledge while I was overseas, \\complicating the situation and leaving Adrian to\ntext me asking why I would not attend the meeting he set up for us. That was heartbreaking.\nAfter several weeks of not seeing any action after   , I began pushing to address the issue again.\nWe finally met with Kari on Sunday, 8/17, where we discussed and agreed on key points to\nsupport Adrian's well-being. What I loved is that this was Adrian’s voice unfiltered. He could\nspeak freely without Christine in the room shaping his narrative, with Kari there to help us.\nThe Agreed-Upon Plan\nDuring our meeting with Kari, the following plan was agreed upon to help reassure Adrian and\nsupport his needs:\n• I agreed to give him a heads-up if we're going to be in a potentially \"exciting\" situation\nwhere I might be more active. Additionally, Adrian agreed that if I use Soberlink once before,\nduring, and after Seahawks games, it will reassure him that I'm sober, helping him feel safe.\nWe've used this approach several times, which has always alleviated his concerns.\n\n• Adrian asked that I refrain from speaking negatively about his mom during our time\ntogether. This request is completely understandable, and I'm fully committed to honoring it.\nHis request surprised me because I've consciously tried to speak positively about Christine\nand sometimes feel I might overcompensate.\n• After the meeting, I relayed the conversation to Christine, and we had a breakthrough\nmoment. She even considered   my offer to begin divorce counseling to mend fences so we\ncould provide a more stable and supportive environment for the children. I felt like that day\nwe made the breakthrough we have needed for a year.\nWhat Happened\nWe then met with Jennifer to confirm Adrian's desire to see me and to ensure that the\nconditions we discussed would allow him to feel safe. While it was clear we couldn't revert to\nDr. Brown's original recommendation, we could have planned for Adrian to attend a Seahawks\ngame last weekend. Despite Adrian's wishes being verified by two therapists in the same week,\nand our prior agreement, Christine refused to allow Adrian to attend the game with me.\nChristine then continued to make unilateral decisions without proper communication. She went\noff the grid, informing me on the day of her departure, then refused to provide contact\ninformation for the person caring for the children. This lack of crucial information was\nparticularly concerning given the recent events: there had been mix-ups involving Adrian twice\nthe day before, and Max had recently been in the ER due to an unexpected heart condition.\nObservation\nChristine's decisions undermine the stability and support our children need, despite Adrian's\nclear wishes and my demonstrated compliance. Her actions disregarded Adrian's expressed\ndesires, placing unnecessary stress on him, and limiting his ability to feel secure and supported\nduring a critical time. The fact that she refused to disclose who was responsible for our children\nwhile she was completely unreachable demonstrates a troubling lack of accountability and\nraises significant concerns about the children's well-being and safety during these periods.\nConclusion\nI have seen this movie before and know how it ends. If you have not, I will not apologize for the\nspoilers. Christine’s consistent dismissal of professional guidance in favor of unilateral decisions\nthat    serve her goals has severely damaged my relationship with Max and Adrian. This behavior\nhas fostered an environment where repeated falsehoods create an \"illusory truth effect,\" which\nhas distorted reality and undermined the trust within our family.\nThe status quo is a\nfalse reality, a narrative concocted by Christine’s rejection of professional\nadvice and her manipulation of the family law system through rejecting plans, changing lawyers,\nand entrenching alienation tactics with improperly filed and still yet-to-be-corrected ROs  .",
