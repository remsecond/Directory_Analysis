I was surprised to hear that was an issue. Per the below, between our\nappointments, she was not allowing any contact with my kids. I agreed to trust you and not send anything to Christine. I did not. I told you, and you said that\nyou trusted me but wanted to verify. You did.\nAt no point did I hear that was a “forever” policy. It was to cool down for the weeks between our visits. If I had heard, I would have asked how we\ncommunicated because that would have been unworkable at that stage. Even as it is, she has violated signed mediation agreements and our residential\nagreement. I am also surprised that it would not have come up when I shared that she and I had made an appointment with you to work on “us” because our\ncommunication had improved so much.\nSo If I did something that you said not to do, I am very surprised and can confirm I never heard and also demonstrated there was continued communication.\nThe other thing I would like to understand is the signed agreement that your work is to be confidential and can’t be used.
