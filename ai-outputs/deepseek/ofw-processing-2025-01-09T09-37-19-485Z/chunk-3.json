We have not had a regular visit for 28 days so it\nwas nice to have a little more time to catch up. As Alan mentioned, we\nenjoyed some donuts, sports, and a movie. I gave him a Bali necklace,\nwhich he liked, and followed it with a lot of time in front of the mirror,\nstyling his hair and asking if he looked like a \"surfer\" like me. It was\npretty cute as he also wanted to re-style me and played his grooming games\n\nAfter the movie, Adrian was visibly disappointed he could not stay longer\nand said he felt like we just got started. I think the movie occupied so\n\nmuch of our \"catch-up\" time. He also said he was going home to sit in his\nroom. No plans. That's nothing new, but I'm pretty jaded. We also have\nNanna's 80th birthday on the horizon, and Christine has Adrian booked for\nan all-day school event, and there are no plans to let him hang out\nwithout Alan present. With success, the situation always gets worse.\n\nI also note that in the past few days, both Max and Elsa reached out to me\nafter three months of silence, expressing intense hostility. Max\nexplicitly told me to stay away from his Curriculum Night and threatened\nto change his name and disown me if I attended. Similarly, Elsa contacted\nme out of the blue after talking with Christine about a past visitation\nreport, displaying aggressive behavior that seemed entirely out of\n\nSo, while my relationship with AD remains positive, I'm afraid the ongoing\ntension and intensely hostile outreach to me might create an that could\neventually take an emotional toll on him.

I fear\nthat this environment, coupled with the limited time we have together,\n\nThe timing and intensity of these recent reactions are concerning, as they\nappear to have been triggered by something Christine may have said or done\nrecently, as confirmed by Elsa. This sudden shift, occurring within a few\ndays of each other, suggests that there has been a deliberate effort to\nre-ignite the hostilities against me.

We got to Target at approximately 1310 hours and picked up some snacks;\nthen, we went to the theater.  When we arrived, our popcorn and beverages that Dad had preordered were\nready.  The movie ended at approximately 1530 hours, and we headed back to Dad’s house to drop him\n\nWhen we arrived back at Dad’s, Dad gave Adrian a hug and kiss, and we left for Mom’s. Mom had texted\nme at 1553 hours that she would not be at home when we arrived. On the way to Mom’s house, I asked\nAdrian if he had fun and liked the movie. He said yes, it was fun.
