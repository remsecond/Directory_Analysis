Hi Jennifer
One check will be fine and we can work on the split between us.
If you send to me, 1210 Kirkland ave, Kirkland wa 98033 and I’ll deposit in the jt account.
Robert please let Jennifer know if you prefer she send to you and share your address, for deposit into the jt account.
I’m fine either way.
Thank you
Christine

So Christine and I both pay from a joint account for the kids that we both fund equally. So, as I understand,
I paid half of hers and she owes half of mine.
It would make more sense to provide one check that we put back into that joint account and we do the accounting between us on that account.

Christine and Robert,
You have a credit balance of $3050. The retainer balance was $3550 but I debited $500 to pay Robert’s portion of my fees for last month as his 
So, I’ve divided $3550 in half = $1775 each. I’m deducting $500 from Robert’s portion to make up for his debit last month.
Christine will receive $1775 and Robert will receive $1275 (= $3050).
Please email me your current mailing address and I will mail you a check.

disagree, which I don’t know how you could since you paid with kids money, I’ll just keep an extra $500 off the next bill.

Hi Lisa,
I've just received Jennifer Keilin's email below regarding discontinuing 
reunification therapy due to "limited parent/child contact." Our situation, 
while concerning given our court-ordered agreement to participate in this 
process, was unfortunately predictable.
I believe that:
   1. Jennifer's statement highlights the obstruction of the court-ordered 
   reunification process, which we both agreed to follow. 
   2. This email could serve as evidence for the court, demonstrating how 
   Christine has again impeded the reunification process. 
   3. We're at an impasse until Connor's evaluation, which means we cannot 
   address our immediate court-ordered obligations. 
I can respond to Jennifer with a professional, concise email that:
   1. Expresses gratitude for her efforts with our family 
   2. Acknowledges the stated reason for discontinuation 
   3. Reaffirms my commitment to the court-ordered process 
   4. Promises to re-engage if parent/child contact issues are resolved 
I won't express frustration or point fingers; I'll just let Jennifer's 
minimalist statement speak for itself. Then, I'll update the attached for 
the most recent Charlie Brown v Lucy football kickoff. Someday, someone has 
to actually read this and discern a pattern. 
I'm trying to figure out the hidden gotchas and be self-critical as well, 
but I've never had even a whiff of DV as it relates to the kids. And I've 
done everything that has been asked of me from a compliance and supervision 
standpoint. So not sure what to think. 
Just let me know...

Here is where we are today... I think this is good even though it looks bad on the surface. My hope is this puts the blame squarely in Christine's lap, with the
therapist just throwing her hands in the air saying the court has to sort this out now...

Hi Lisa,
I've just received Jennifer Keilin's email below regarding discontinuing reunification therapy due to "limited parent/child contact." Our situation, while
concerning given our court-ordered agreement to participate in this process, was unfortunately predictable.
I believe that:
1. Jennifer's statement highlights the obstruction of the court-ordered reunification process, which we both agreed to follow.
2. This email could serve as evidence for the court, demonstrating how Christine has again impeded the reunification process.
3. We're at an impasse until Connor's evaluation, which means we cannot address our immediate court-ordered obligations.
I can respond to Jennifer with a professional, concise email that:
1. Expresses gratitude for her efforts with our family
2. Acknowledges the stated reason for discontinuation
3. Reaffirms my commitment to the court-ordered process
4. Promises to re-engage if parent/child contact issues are resolved
I won't express frustration or point fingers; I'll just let Jennifer's minimalist statement speak for itself. Then, I'll update the attached for the most recent Charlie
Brown v Lucy football kickoff. Someday, someone has to actually read this and discern a pattern. 
I'm trying to figure out the hidden gotchas and be self-critical as well, but I've never had even a whiff of DV as it relates to the kids. And I've done everything
that has been asked of me from a compliance and supervision standpoint. So not sure what to think. 
Just let me know...

Introduction 
 
Amid confusing and chaotic events, stepping off the dance floor and observing from the balcony 
is sometimes necessary. This shift allows us to rise above the day-to-day turmoil and see the 
bigger picture, helping us collect thoughts and make better, more informed decisions. 
It's important to remember why we're here today. Christine and I chose not to involve a 
Guardian ad Litem or parental evaluator, believing that avoiding these processes would spare 
our children undue stress and expedite a resolution. Christine and I agreed it would be in Max 
and Adrian's best interests to have a plan in place sooner, one we could both agree on. 
I'm often asked why I didn't seek a court order to enforce a parenting plan. The answer is that I 
had Christine's word that we would follow professional advice. I believed her repeatedly. But 
she delayed the process, rejected multiple plans, changed lawyers, and postponed the 
involvement of a parental evaluator. There was always a reason to ignore and delay the plan. 
A week ago today,  with Jennifer, Adrian reaffirmed his desire to spend more time with me under 
the    conditions we discussed with Kari on 8/17. We had the opportunity to implement these 
safeguards during last    week’s Seahawks game and enjoy the opportunity, but Christine said no 
to Adrian’s wishes, and her control of the children intensified. Days after a cardio ER visit for 
Max  , she even refused to share contact details for their caregiver . Things are getting worse. 
Moving forward, it's crucial to evaluate whether the status quo, reinforced by a false narrative, 
should remain our starting point. Allowing this distorted reality to persist only harms Max and 
Adrian by eroding the trust in our relationship. Christine's pattern of control, disregard for 
professional advice, and violations of recent court orders show she operates with impunity. 
Unfortunately, repeated falsehoods have created an "illusory truth effect" within our family, 
distorting reality, and undermining trust. Her rejection of professional guidance for unilateral 
decisions has severely damaged Max and Adrian's relationship with their father. 
This document chronicles the consequences of our parenting plan negotiations, highlighting 
multiple instances where Christine disregarded expert advice, absent any safety concerns on 
behalf of the professionals we work with, resulting in a number of terrible consequences: 
• Erosion of trust within our family unit and a false portrayal of me as an unsafe father 
• Profound compromise of Max and Adrian's emotional and psychological well-being 
• Deliberate undermining of my role as their father and any need for me in their lives 
  
12 / 125

As their father, it’s incredibly painful to witness how the continuous rejection of professional 
advice and resulting alienation from me has strained our relationship and left our kids 
vulnerable at a time when they need stability and support the most. And while adhering to 
professional guidance isn’t a legal formality at this time, this should be about safeguarding our 
children’s best interests. That is not happening. Their best interests are being ignored.  
Professional Recommendations 
Yurushka Martin: Discernment Counseling 
Discernment counseling was intended to help Christine and me navigate the initial stages of our 
separation with a focus on the well-being of our children, Max and Adrian. Unfortunately, the 
counseling quickly diverged from its purpose. Within minutes of the first meeting, Christine and 
Yurushka shifted focus to a domestic violence strategy that was concealed from me. Hopping on 
a private phone call, they began derailing our    efforts to foster a collaborative, stable 
environment for our family. Despite the detour, we continued under the premise of creating a 
safe and loving environment for the children. The critical agreements included: 
The Agreed-Upon Plan 
• Scheduled Family Dinners: Regularly scheduled family dinners should be arranged to foster 
stability and create trust for the children's benefit. We will mutually agree upon the dates, 
ideally incorporating one weekday and one weekend. 
• Living Arrangements: To ensure safety, welfare, and peace of mind for all parties involved, it 
is crucial to establish clear and mutually agreed-upon guidelines for interactions and visits to 
the shared residences over the next 3-N months. This arrangement is not a legal 
abandonment of the abode but a peace offering to foster a secure and harmonious 
environment. 
• Scheduled Visits Only: Any visit to the residences requires prior approval from the other 
party, with no exceptions. The home must remain a safe and secure space for everyone 
there. Violations may warrant police involvement if necessary. 
• Purpose of Visits: Requests for visits must be related to child-centric activities, such as family 
dinners, sports, pickups, shared chores, etc. Visits should solely focus on the well-being and 
engagement of the children. They are not used for a time for just us. 
• Respect and Privacy: Respect for each other's space is paramount. Knock on closed doors 
and don't touch each other's belongings. Act as a guest and respect each other's privacy and 
possessions. Treat the space as we would a friend's house.

• Duty to Report: Christine said Yurushka explained her "duty to report." as a licensed 
therapist. So, if Yurushka has reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected 
or is in imminent danger of harming themselves or others, she is legally required to report 
this to the appropriate authorities. 
What Happened 
Christine repeatedly disregarded the plan despite the clear agreements made during our 
sessions with Yurushka. She canceled or excluded me from scheduled family dinners, 
undermining our efforts to create stability for Max and Adrian. Additionally, Christine 
intentionally misrepresented my temporary sleep arrangements as abandonment, which led to 
further unilateral decisions that violated our agreed-upon living arrangements. Visits that were 
supposed to be child-centric became sources of conflict, with Christine refusing necessary 
approval or using them to create discord. Yurushka did enormous damage to us early on by 
triangulating with Christine and helping establish a precedent that Christine was omnipotent.  
Observation 
Christine’s refusal to adhere to the agreed-upon plan during what was supposed to be 
discernment counseling but turned into a personal agenda, significantly disrupted the stability 
we were trying to establish for our children. As I did my level best, her unilateral decisions 
undermined our efforts to foster trust and security for Max and Adrian and led to conflicts that 
made it harder to maintain a collaborative co-parenting relationship. The ongoing dismissal of 
professional advice that    continues to challenge our ability to prioritize our children began here. 
 
Debbie Bayer: Effective Co-Parenting 
Following our challenging and secretive sessions with Yurushka Martin, we sought to re-
establish stability through Debbie Bayer's guidance, hoping to overcome the obstacles that had 
emerged in our co-parenting efforts. She had been seeing us since 2019 and knew my history of 
addiction well. We chose her because she has always been extremely hard on me, as she should 
be.  
Our engagement with Debbie marked our second attempt to establish a balanced and 
cooperative parenting plan following the attempt at discernment counseling. Debbie’s role was 
to guide us through the complexities of co-parenting during the holidays and beyond, focusing 
on creating a stable and supportive environment for our children, Max, and Adrian.  
Unfortunately, this attempt further highlighted a troubling pattern: the continued disregard for 
professional advice, which only deepened the challenges in our co-parenting relationship. 
When Christine quit going to counseling because she no longer wanted to co-parent with me, 
Debbie forecasted every event that    happened till today with clairvoyant accuracy- all of this  .

The Agreed-Upon Plan 
During sessions with Debbie, several key agreements were established to ensure the holiday 
season would be a time of stability and joy for the children despite the    ongoing separation: 
• Christine does not feel safe with joint holiday visits and celebrations at this time, so Robert 
is not invited to spend time with his family. 
• Robert will find accommodation that is large enough to accommodate separate holiday 
celebrations for December. 
• The kids and Robert will work on establishing "new traditions" so the kids can begin to 
adjust to their new normal. 
• We agreed that one of us would get Christmas Eve and the other Christmas Day as part of 
this arrangement. 
• Christine said Debbie explained her "duty to report." as a licensed therapist. If Debbie has 
reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected or is in imminent danger of 
harming themselves, she is legally required to report this to the appropriate authorities. 
What Happened 
Despite the clear plan established with Debbie Bayer to ensure a stable holiday season for our 
children, Christine unilaterally imposed a "no driving and no overnights" policy without 
substantiated reasons. Christine arranged for the children to stay with friends during her work 
travels, implying that I was an unsafe caregiver to our friends despite Debbie not reporting any 
safety concerns. She cited a vague "legal strategy" to justify her new restrictions, directly 
contradicting Debbie's recommendations. This was a huge change in our visitation plan. 
Instead of working together to help Max and Adrian adjust to their “new normal,” Christine 
undermined our agreed holiday schedule, taking them on a surprise five-star vacation to 
California for theme park tours. Fortunately, Dr Brown stepped in, and we adopted her 
parenting plan for the last days of December. Christine took both days after we agreed to split 
Christmas Eve/Day with Dr. Brown. I did, however, get    an encore Christmas Day with the kids. 
Observation 
Christine's pattern of unilateral decision-making during this phase further disrupted our co-
parenting efforts. Ignoring Debbie Bayer's professional advice strained my relationship with Max 
and Adrian and hindered their adjustment to new family traditions.  
She doubled down on disregarding the Holiday Plans by not allowing me to see them and taking 
them to expensive resorts, flying 1
st
 class, and then lavishing them with expensive gifts. Her 
disregard for expert guidance and flaunting her   contempt for our agreements weakened the 
trust and stability our children need, amplifying concerns about her underlying motivations.

Dr Monique Brown: Defining the Parenting Plan 
Despite Debbie Bayer's attempts to foster cooperation during the holiday season, the ongoing 
issues necessitated the involvement of Dr. Monique Brown, whose structured approach aimed 
to bring clarity and fairness to our parenting plan. In her words, her mission was to “make us 
both equally unhappy.” She would define our parenting plan now. I asked to conduct this 
exercise with Jennifer Kellin, who provided us with excellent sample work products. Christine’s 
attorney pushed hard for Dr. Brown instead, so we went with her as a gesture of good faith.  
The involvement of Dr. Monique Brown represented a pivotal moment in our parenting plan 
negotiations. Dr. Brown was tasked with creating a structured and phased approach designed 
to balance the needs of our children, particularly Adrian, while ensuring a fair and cooperative 
co-parenting arrangement. We spent months with Dr. Brown from December to March, and the 
parenting plan was revisited several times but was unchanged, taking many meetings with the 
entire family and my history of addiction and verbal abuse into account  .  
After adopting her plan for a few weeks, Christine rejected Dr. Brown’s professional advice and 
contradicted our children's expressed desires as part of her    legal strategy. Adrian asked to see 
me on numerous occasions, but her refusal to honor the agreed-upon plan led to the collapse of 
our sixth attempt at a parenting plan. This further alienated me from my children and 
exacerbated the growing disconnect between their best interests and Christine’s narrative.  
The Agreed-Upon Plan 
Dr. Brown proposed a clear, phased approach to help transition our family into a stable, 
supportive co-parenting arrangement. The plan was structured into two phases: 
Phase I: 
• Starts immediately and concludes upon both: (1) full compliance with Soberlink 
requirements under Section 14. 
• Max: If Max chooses, Father will have a dinner visit in a location of Max's choice every week 
and can stay overnight at Robert's house or spend additional time whenever he wants. 
• Adrian: Adrian will reside with Robert every other weekend from Saturday 9 am until 
Sunday 8 pm and an after-school visit every Wednesday. 
Phase II: 
• The children will reside with Robert every other weekend from Friday at 3 pm to Monday at 
8 pm and every Wednesday from 3 pm until Thursday at 8 pm. 
16 / 125

6    | Page 
 
• The parents agree that after 3 months in Phase II, the parties will agree to schedule a 
mediation to address the issue of if/when Adrian moves to a 50-50 week-on, week-off 
residential schedule. 
• The Summer Schedule is the same as the School Schedule except each parent shall spend 
two (2) weeks, which may be taken together (7 consecutive overnight blocks or 14-day 
block) of uninterrupted vacation time. 
• The children shall not go more than 14 days without seeing the other parent. 
• Unless there are extraordinary considerations related to the father's proposed vacation 
location, the mother will not object or seek to prevent the vacation from transpiring at all. 
• Christine said Dr. Brown explained her "duty to report" as a licensed therapist. So, if Dr. 
Brown has reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected or is in imminent 
danger of harming themselves or others, she is legally required to report this to the 
appropriate authorities. 
What Happened 
Despite Dr. Brown's structured and phased approach to helping our family transition into a 
stable co-parenting arrangement, Christine repeatedly refused to honor the agreed-upon plan, 
dismissing Dr. Brown's qualifications for her internet research and legal guidance. We went 
back to Dr. Brown three times at Christine’s request. None of the plans satisfied Christine in the 
end  , and while we agreed to a 60/40 split, the breaking point was my ask for the path to 50/50.  
Christine decided to take her ball and go home. So, instead of being at either 60/40 or 50/50 
with a whole summer of shared activities, my contact with the children was severely limited—
no overnights, no driving, and only six hours together for the entire month of July. What should 
have been a summer filled with meaningful bonding time in a house I can’t afford but rented 
for us to do that, was reduced to a few hours with one child and a false reality. 
Observation 
Christine's dismissal of Dr. Brown's professional advice and the agreed-upon plan disrupted the 
stability our children needed and damaged our co-parenting relationship. By rejecting a plan  , 
which we had adopted for weeks that posed no safety risks, according to Dr Brown, Christine 
distanced the children from me, deepening the disconnect between their best interests and her 
actions. Her gatekeeping ignored the children’s emotional well-being and prohibited effective 
co-parenting, something she continues to say is impossible, insisting on “Parallel Parenting.”

Kari Betts:  Child Therapist  
During the collapse of our sixth attempt at a parenting plan under Dr. Brown, the kids began to 
see  Kari Betts, whose role was crucial in continuing the efforts to create a supportive 
environment for our children. She was very intentional in saying that she would not be involved 
in the parenting plan in any way and would offer no opinions on the matter. She was strictly 
there on behalf of the kids to ensure they had a voice during this awful time.  
The introductory meeting with Kari Betts was intended to see how the kids reacted to Dr. 
Brown's recommendations, ensuring that Christine and I could work collaboratively. to prioritize 
the well-being of our children, particularly Adrian. However, in a 1st meeting with the three of 
them without me, Christine decided what she heard, albeit different from what Kari reported, 
gave her grounds to abandon Dr. Brown’s plan altogether and cut off all visitation from me.  
The 
Not Agreed-Upon Plan 
Dr Brown  ’s plan should have guided our actions during this phase and should have continued 
with no justifiable reasons to stop. However, after their private meeting, the following occurred.  
• "As of now,
 I can really only recall making safety plan recommendations -  like safety check-
ins and what to do if he identifies high on the scale and needs additional support
. This same 
safety plan applies until our next session. We can readdress it at the next session and see if 
we want to make any adjustments to it then. Unless, you think further supportive measures 
are needed at this time?" – Kari Betts, Wednesday, 03/20/2024 
• "Conversation with Kari after the meeting with Adrian was heartbreaking. What he 
communicated to her in an honest and open environment was incredibly brave and
 I need to 
respect and frankly have no choice but to take action on his own expressed words. She made 
it clear to me if she believes he is in, or put in an unsafe situation, she must take action. That 
is her obligation." – Christine Moyer, Wednesday, 03/20/2024 
• Despite the contradictions above, 
Christine made the unilateral decision to disregard Dr. 
Brown's plan and end all visitation between the children and myself 
despite continued 
professional recommendations to proceed with Phase I for the benefit of the children.  
What Happened 
This was a unilateral decision of enormous consequence.    It was an almost unthinkable swing 
from co-parenting to total isolation for the kids and me. So, after learning that Christine had 
been in the room with Adrian during the initial session, a fact she initially denied, I requested a 
follow-up meeting to clarify what had occurred. This follow-up meeting was tense and revealed 
significant differences in how the meeting was perceived and the information that was 
conveyed. Kari stuck by her account, and there was no safety risk identified from me by her.  
18 / 125

8    | Page 
 
Despite the clear guidance from both Dr. Brown and Kari Betts, Christine unilaterally 
disregarded the agreed-upon plan we had in place and ended it, leading to the complete 
termination of all visitations between Adrian and me, positioning me as an unsafe parent. 
Observation 
Christine's unilateral actions during this phase disrupted our parenting plan and eroded the 
trust within our family. Ignoring professional advice and justifying her decisions with 
contradictory reasoning further distanced Max and Adrian from me, compromising their 
emotional well-being. Her behavior, including claiming safety concerns about me while allowing 
me to coach and volunteer with other children at their schools and on their sports teams, 
undermines her own story, our co-parenting efforts, and the stability our children need.  
Against all professional advice, this is how Christine unilaterally implemented her status quo. 
 
Kari Betts: Adrian’s Requested Meeting 
Prior meetings with Kari exposed Christine's misuse of the therapeutic process in our complex 
situation. Before his upcoming Hong Kong trip, Adrian urgently requested a joint session with 
Kari and me, hoping to address issues between us and improve the relationship we had 
devolved into. Notably, the previous year, after a huge fight with Elsa and meeting with her 
mother, Christine told the children that they would be divorcing me upon their return. 
I asked to have the meeting before Hong Kong, but the request was denied despite its clear 
significance. A meeting was eventually scheduled after their return. Unfortunately, it was done 
without my knowledge while I was overseas, \complicating the situation and leaving Adrian to 
text me asking why I would not attend the meeting he set up for us. That was heartbreaking. 
After several weeks of not seeing any action after   , I began pushing to address the issue again. 
We finally met with Kari on Sunday, 8/17, where we discussed and agreed on key points to 
support Adrian's well-being. What I loved is that this was Adrian’s voice unfiltered. He could 
speak freely without Christine in the room shaping his narrative, with Kari there to help us. 
The Agreed-Upon Plan 
During our meeting with Kari, the following plan was agreed upon to help reassure Adrian and 
support his needs: 
• I agreed to give him a heads-up if we're going to be in a potentially "exciting" situation 
where I might be more active. Additionally, Adrian agreed that if I use Soberlink once before, 
during, and after Seahawks games, it will reassure him that I'm sober, helping him feel safe. 
We've used this approach several times, which has always alleviated his concerns. 
19 / 125

9    | Page 
 
• Adrian asked that I refrain from speaking negatively about his mom during our time 
together. This request is completely understandable, and I'm fully committed to honoring it. 
His request surprised me because I've consciously tried to speak positively about Christine 
and sometimes feel I might overcompensate. 
• After the meeting, I relayed the conversation to Christine, and we had a breakthrough 
moment. She even considered   my offer to begin divorce counseling to mend fences so we 
could provide a more stable and supportive environment for the children. I felt like that day 
we made the breakthrough we have needed for a year.  
What Happened 
We then met with Jennifer to confirm Adrian's desire to see me and to ensure that the 
conditions we discussed would allow him to feel safe. While it was clear we couldn't revert to 
Dr. Brown's original recommendation, we could have planned for Adrian to attend a Seahawks 
game last weekend. Despite Adrian's wishes being verified by two therapists in the same week, 
and our prior agreement, Christine refused to allow Adrian to attend the game with me. 
Christine then continued to make unilateral decisions without proper communication. She went 
off the grid, informing me on the day of her departure, then refused to provide contact 
information for the person caring for the children. This lack of crucial information was 
particularly concerning given the recent events: there had been mix-ups involving Adrian twice 
the day before, and Max had recently been in the ER due to an unexpected heart condition. 
Observation 
Christine's decisions undermine the stability and support our children need, despite Adrian's 
clear wishes and my demonstrated compliance. Her actions disregarded Adrian's expressed 
desires, placing unnecessary stress on him, and limiting his ability to feel secure and supported 
during a critical time. The fact that she refused to disclose who was responsible for our children 
while she was completely unreachable demonstrates a troubling lack of accountability and 
raises significant concerns about the children's well-being and safety during these periods. 
Conclusion 
I have seen this movie before and know how it ends. If you have not, I will not apologize for the 
spoilers. Christine’s consistent dismissal of professional guidance in favor of unilateral decisions 
that    serve her goals has severely damaged my relationship with Max and Adrian. This behavior 
has fostered an environment where repeated falsehoods create an "illusory truth effect," which 
has distorted reality and undermined the trust within our family.  
The status quo is a 
false reality, a narrative concocted by Christine’s rejection of professional 
advice and her manipulation of the family law system through rejecting plans, changing lawyers, 
and entrenching alienation tactics with improperly filed and still yet-to-be-corrected ROs  .  
20 / 125

10 | Page 
 
The most alarming consequence is that Max and Adrian, as children subjected to this false 
narrative, have begun to believe and live it. This dangerous cycle of alienation just    reinforces 
itself   , making the false reality even more entrenched. This cycle must be stopped, and we 
should never use Christine's false reality as the starting point  for future decisions again.  
Key issues demanding immediate attention: 
• Rejection of Expert Guidance: Professional recommendations are    consistently ignored, 
compromising children's well-being. 
• Distortion of Reality: Repeated falsehoods eroding family trust and reinforcing alienation is 
detrimental to Max and Adrian. 
• Undermining Parental Relationships: My role as father diminished, limiting my   ability to 
support Max and Adrian. 
• Disregard for Children's Voices: Adrian's wishes are    dismissed, leaving both children feeling 
unheard and isolated. 
• Weaponizing Safety Concerns: Inconsistent application of safety issues raises questions 
about motivations. 
Given our situation, we must: 
• Reject the False Reality: Recognize the status quo as a result of manipulative tactics, not a 
legitimate starting point. 
• Break the Cycle of Alienation: Stop reinforcing the false narratives Max and Adrian have 
been conditioned to believe. 
• Rebuild Trust: Base decisions on facts and professional assessments, not manipulated 
narratives. 
• Follow Professional Guidance: Root every step in expert recommendations, not personal 
agendas. 
• Prioritize Children's Well-Being: Let Max and Adrian's needs guide all actions but separate 
their truth from propaganda. 
• Commit to Collaborative Co-Parenting: End counterproductive excuses and establish 
transparent communication. 
Adhering to these principles and grounding decisions in truth is crucial to repairing damage and 
creating a healthier environment for Max and Adrian. Their well-being depends on immediate 
action to address these issues. This unilateral decision-making needs to stop now.

This is super helpful, Leah. It makes total sense. 
In its simple wisdom it reminds me of another saying I heard recently that said something like "If you don't trust someone's judgment, then their criticism
should not matter either."  
Much appreciated

So I called to check in on Max, after seeing Christine says that he was not
feeling well for two days in a row. Max answered and immediately addressed
me in an aggressive voice, saying, "Robert, you listen to me, you little
bitch." And said, “I saw you blowing Mom’s phone again,” which is
impossible since all communication from me is blocked, except through Our
Family Wizard (OFW) or in jointly addressed emails from third parties. I
attempted to clarify this to Max, explaining that I cannot contact
Christine directly outside of these channels. He still said I did and he
knew because Christine allows him to go through her phone to see all our
communications, which made me very uncomfortable.
Max continued by accusing me of posting pictures of him and, Elsa, online
to go after Christine, which I believe was prompted by the misinformation
from Elsa from she got Mom on Monday when she had confronted me with a
similar accusation. I tried to explain the situation, but Max insisted that
Elsa could not be wrong and called me a "big fucking liar." At that point,
I suggested we talk another time and hung up, similar to Elsa. Shortly
after, Max called me back. I should have let the call go to voicemail but
chose to answer. He was shouting the same "Robert" insults and then
escalated the situation by saying that he and Elsa would "never forgive me"
and that they were "*going to make me pay for this shit.*”
I don’t know if he has tried to text or call again because he is still
blocked. But I mentioned this morning that I did not think this was a safe
situation anymore. And it scares me because of the level of intensity and
sincere hostility after going so long with no contact at all. I know this
all just came out of left field unless it is motivated by my ask to start
following the residential plan and now she has rallied the troops. That is
the only thing I can even think of. Obviously, *I am going to steer clear
altogether now*, but tonight's threats made by Max, especially when
combined with the involvement of Elsa, seem way over the line. The
situation is very scary, kinetic, and unstable. I fear for both Adrian and
myself now.

official, like the police as a non-emergency call? I don’t want to make
things worse, but I’m honestly scared of what may happen next.
Side Note: Max has sent me to the hospital before, coming at me in front of
Mom and AD. So, I have seen what he can do when he is upset enough to try
and physically hurt me. It’s not pretty. And like last time, I am not going
to fight back, he is my son. I hated that I was not talking to Elsa and
Max, but this is FAR worse now.

Elsa is out of line and so is Christine for sharing things with her.

Subject: FW: Moyer Supervised Visitation Report, 09-14-24
 
I'm overdue for sending this, but I no longer look forward to it. After this
week's events, I will also not share pictures of our visit this time. 
 
Passing along last Saturday's supervised visitation report. It was a lot of
fun to see Adrian. We have not had a regular visit for 28 days, so it was
nice to have a little more time to catch up. As Alan mentioned, we enjoyed
donuts, sports, and a movie. I gave him a Bali necklace, which he liked, and
followed it with a lot of time in front of the mirror, styling his hair and
asking if he looked like a "surfer" like me. It was pretty cute as he also
wanted to re-style me and played his "gorilla grooming" games on Dad. 
 
After the movie, Adrian was visibly disappointed he could not stay longer
and said he felt like we just got started. I think the movie occupied too
much of our "catch-up" time. He also said he was going home to sit in his
room. No plans- bummer. We also have Nanna's 80th birthday unresolved on the
horizon, and Christine has Adrian booked for an all-day school event, and
there are no plans to let him hang out without Alan present. With each
supervised visit, the situation always gets worse. 
 
Max and Elsa also reached out to me in the past few days after three months
of silence, expressing intense hostility. Max explicitly told me to stay
away from his Curriculum Night and threatened to change his name and disown
me if I attended. Similarly, Elsa contacted me out of the blue after talking
with Christine about a past visitation report that had a family pic,
displaying aggressive behavior while using Christine's familiar language. I
hung up after hearing, "You are awful, an awful human being."
 
So, while my relationship with AD remains positive, I'm afraid the ongoing
tension and intensely hostile outreach to me, might create a situation that
could eventually take an emotional toll on him. It certainly has me. I worry
29 / 125

that Adrian might be outgunned by the influence surrounding him and that
this may have long-term effects on his emotional and mental health. I fear
that this environment and the limited time we have together might cause
Adrian to internalize these negative sentiments.
 
The timing and intensity of these recent reactions are concerning, as they
appear to have been triggered by something Christine may have said or done
recently, as confirmed by Elsa. This sudden shift, occurring within a few
days of each other, suggests that there has been a deliberate effort to
re-ignite the hostilities against me. Since neither Max nor Elsa had spoken
to me for months, this coordinated hostility is alarming and has left me
shaken and more worried about Adrain if we continue.
 
Timeline of Events:
*       9/04: Christine and I attend Adrian's Curriculum Night at SAAS. It
went remarkably well, and I shared with Christine that I hoped to build on
this cooperation.
*       9/06: I sent a follow-up email to Christine, reflecting on how well
we worked together and expressing hope for continued collaboration looking
forward to next week.
*       9/12: After a week of resisting any attempts to continue to work
together I acknowledge I should probably have an exit plan, seeing that
things seem to be getting worse.
*       9/12: Next week, Max reached out to me, insisting that I should not
attend his Curriculum Night and threatening legal action if I did, a drastic
shift from his silence.
*       9/13: Lisa asked for Adrian to spend time with my mother for her
80th birthday. Christine has AD scheduled, preventing any meaningful family
time. We got no response.
*       9/16: With the date fast approaching and numerous residential plan
violations happening, a court motion with clear evidence was filed to
enforce our residential plan. 
*       9/17: Christine informed Elsa about the court motion, and Elsa
reached out to me with some incredibly harsh words, echoing Max's hostility
following months of no contact.
*       9/17: Shaken to my core and feeling major PTSD, I have an ad-hoc
session with Luis to understand how to cope with the "out of the blue"
aggression from Manx and Elsa
 
Seeing the sudden shift in Max and Elsa's behavior, I have legitimate
concerns about the well-being of all three of my children. The emotional and
psychological toll this is taking on them, and on me, is significant. I fear
that without a change, the situation will continue to deteriorate, causing
lasting damage to my relationship with my children and their mental health.
Given our current trajectory, I am no longer comfortable with the possible
impact on Adrian at home in the current arrangement and I hope we will
consider additional measures to prevent further deterioration. None of this
feels safe to me anymore.
 
 
Trying to recognize a great night of cooperation, lots of safe face time
together and what felt like confirmation we can do this.
 
Max, in his "man-of-the-house role", tells me he is there to protect Mom,
and I better not show up even though last week went great. 
 
Elsa call me and says never share the fathers day pic of her and Adrain. I
respect that and a very hostile call ends with me hanging up.

to change his name and disown me if I attended. Similarly, Elsa contacted
me out of the blue after talking with Christine about a past visitation
report, displaying aggressive behavior that seemed entirely out of
character. I hung up after hearing, "You are awful, an awful human being."
 
So, while my relationship with AD remains positive, I'm afraid the ongoing
tension and intensely hostile outreach to me might create an that could
eventually take an emotional toll on him. It certainly has me. I worry
that Adrian might be outgunned by the influence surrounding him and that
this may have long-term effects on his emotional and mental health. I fear
that this environment, coupled with the limited time we have together,
might cause Adrian to internalize these negative sentiments.
 
The timing and intensity of these recent reactions are concerning, as they
appear to have been triggered by something Christine may have said or done
recently, as confirmed by Elsa. This sudden shift, occurring within a few
days of each other, suggests that there has been a deliberate effort to
re-ignite the hostilities against me. Since neither Max nor Elsa had
spoken to me for months, this coordinated hostility is alarming and has
left me shaken, and more worried about Adrain if we continue.
 
Timeline of Events:
*       9/04: Christine and I attend Adrian's Curriculum Night at SAAS. It
went remarkably well, and I shared with Christine that I hoped to build on
this cooperation.
*       9/06: I sent a follow-up email to Christine, reflecting on how
well we worked together and expressing hope for continued collaboration
looking forward to next week.
*       9/12: After a week of resisting any attempts to continue to work
together I acknowledge I should probably have an exit plan, seeing that
things seem to be getting worse.
*       9/12: Next week, Max reached out to me, insisting that I should
not attend his Curriculum Night and threatening legal action if I did, a
drastic shift from his silence.
*       9/13: Lisa asked for Adrian to spend time with my mother for her
80th birthday. Christine has AD scheduled, preventing any meaningful
family time. We got no response.
*       9/16: With the date fast approaching and numerous residential plan
violations happening, a court motion with clear evidence was filed to
enforce our residential plan. 
*       9/17: Christine informed Elsa about the court motion, and Elsa
reached out to me with some incredibly harsh words, echoing Max's
hostility following months of no contact.
*       9/17: Shaken to my core and feeling major PTSD, I have an ad-hoc
session with Luis to understand how to cope with the "out of the blue"
aggression from Manx and Elsa
 
Seeing the sudden shift in Max and Elsa's behavior, I believe there are
legitimate concerns about the well-being of all three of my children. The
emotional and psychological toll this is taking on them, and on me, is
significant. I fear that without a change, the situation will continue to
deteriorate, causing lasting damage to my relationship with my children
and their mental health. Given our current trajectory, I am no longer
comfortable with the possible impact on Adrian at home in our current
arrangement. 
 
None of this feels safe to me anymore and it only gets worse every day. 
 
 
Trying to recognize a great night of cooperation, lots of safe face time
together and what felt like confirmation we can do this.
 
Max, in his "man-of-the-house role", tells me he is there to protect Mom,
and I better not show up even though last week went great. 
 
Elsa call me and says never share the fathers day pic of her and Adrain. I
respect that and a very hostile call ends with me hanging up.

Strawberry milk, Sufer like me , necklace, Hair styling, monkey grooming
Passing along last Saturday's supervised visitation report. It was a lot of fun to see Adrian. We have not had a regular visit for 28 days so it was nice to have
a little more time to catch up. As Alan mentioned, we enjoyed some donuts, sports, and a movie. When we got done and dropped me off, Adrian was visibly
disappointed he could not stay longer and said he felt like we just got started. This was probably because the movie took up so much "catch-up" time. I also
knew he was going home to sit in his room alone. So that sucks tbh. But I'm pretty jaded as the custody split us hovering around 99/1 in the last month with
Nanna's 80th b-day on the horizon, and even though Christine worked out the date with my Mom, she has Adrian booked with an all-day school event and no
plans to let him hang out without Alan present. The situation always gets worse. Always.
On that note my real concern is for Adrian at this point. I had mentioned on XXXX that I needed to pull back. This is counterproductive. It is selfish of me at
this point to put this beautiful. Brave, little man, through this any longer. He has always been my very best friend. I have been his Dad, his coach, his
confidant since the day I delivered him. But now he has not responded to my texts in a month. Before we signed off nightly after a chat or Facetime with "Ego
Amo Te," our way to say I love you in Latin. An inside joke. But after the last ten days, I've been more convicted than ever. He is the sole supporter in a house
of Dad haters and I can't ask that of my little Mensa boy. The point has been driven home with stark examples of the collective and growing acrimony in the
last couple of weeks with Christine and both my other kids reaching out to hate actively hate on me. After not talking since Father's Day. It honestly feels like
this is out of the blue, but for it to happen with both Max and Elsa a few days apart after three months of silence is just too weird.

Case:  Robert Moyer and Christine Moyer 
 
On 09-14-2024, I, Alan Schneider, supervised a visit between Robert Moyer (Dad) and his son Adrian 
Moyer.  The visit was 6 hours and occurred at approximately 1000-1600 hours.  The visit was located at 
Dad’s house and AMC Theater in Factoria. 
 
I arrived to pick up Adrian from Mom at approximately 0940 hours for a visit with Dad.  Mom came to 
the door when I arrived, and I went inside.  Adrian was getting ready to go. Adrian put on his shoes, and 
we went out to the car.  We left and headed to Dad’s house. 
 
We arrived at Dad’s at approximately 1004 hours.  Dad came out of the house, and Adrian hugged Dad.  
We all went into the house, and Dad had the football game on, so we sat down and visited while watching 
it.  Dad had also picked up some donuts for all of us, so we went into the kitchen to eat before returning to 
the living room and watching some more of the game.  After approximately 30 minutes, we all went 
downstairs to watch the game on the TV down there.   
 
At approximately 1115 hours, Adrian asked Dad if we could watch a movie, and Adrian brought up 
Beetlejuice.  Dad got online to see where it was playing and told Adrian where and when it was.  Adrian 
also wanted to go to the Dollar Store for snacks, but it was too far away, so we decided to go to Target 
next to the theater instead. We got to Target at approximately 1310 hours and picked up some snacks; 
then, we went to the theater.  When we arrived, our popcorn and beverages that Dad had preordered were 
ready.  The movie ended at approximately 1530 hours, and we headed back to Dad’s house to drop him 
off.   
 
When we arrived back at Dad’s, Dad gave Adrian a hug and kiss, and we left for Mom’s. Mom had texted 
me at 1553 hours that she would not be at home when we arrived. On the way to Mom’s house, I asked 
Adrian if he had fun and liked the movie. He said yes, it was fun. We arrived back at Mom’s at 
approximately 1607 hours.  I dropped Adrian at the house and went on my way.  The visit seemed to go 
very well, and Adrian enjoyed being with his dad.   
 
The visit went without incident.       
 
Under the penalty of perjury, under the laws of the State of Washington, I declare that the preceding 
statement is accurate to the best of my knowledge.

You refuse to engage on not paying Jennifer after draining the account you asked me to bill from. I did as you asked, and our check bounced.
I have sent you email to two accounts and on OFW. No response anywhere. Plenty of other responses, but none on our reunification therapy.
Where do you think this is honestly going to end, Christine? Is this what you dreamed your next act would be like? It’s only going to get worse.

Robert
The court entered the stipulation on September 5 but did not send us the entered order which is the normal course. I am sorry for the delay in getting this to
you. Do you want to prepare the letter to Fidelity with the full account numbers? It needs to be signed by you and Christine. I am sending the order to Natalie
next.

well done... Jennifer has to get in line with the rest of my creditors and
landlord now....I assume this is another intentional attempt to keep prying
eyes from your hermit kingdom- make it impossible to pay the person in
charge of reunification. Then she stops. You are something else.

Understood.... I will work on it ASAP. 
The part you are missing is that I have the same issue with my rent and all my credit cards. Christine is moving like molten lava after violating our mediation
order. 
So all our accounts have been frozen for almost a month. To my dismay, this has been a loss of about 30k, my credit, and my landlord's relationship. 
You see only a limited piece of the puzzle of what is actually going on. I'll find a card with something on it by tonight.

BTW- sharing so perhaps you have hope T
Over the course of 2.5 hours from 6:00-8:30, across eight classes located between four buildings, Christine and I sat elbow to elbow and took notes, joked,
and chatted with each other, teachers, and other parents. We even did a quick science lab together and played introduction games. 
We agreed it was a safe space, and no shop talk. At the end, we walked out together and said a simple goodnight. Without "cameras running," we can be
completely normal and work as a team. Something happens with an audience, like teenage boys trying to show off. Who knows why?

So... this was a session for Christine and me to discuss considering some flavor of divorce counseling. I believe if we can't even be civil, we will never get
anywhere - kids, money, our lives. 
There is too much crazy, unexplained hate, it is just counterproductive. I was hoping to get your perspective (with her there) about seeing someone to help us
bury the hatchet and see each other as human again.  
It is just too crazy to go from our "best ever" on June 30th  to flipping a bit in one day and have this horrible hate and loathing overnight. It makes no sense to
me at all.

It is just too crazy to go from our "best ever" on June 30th  to flipping a
bit in one day and have this horrible hate and loathing overnight. It makes
no sense to me at all.

Jennifer's observa ons about my supposed impulsive behavior and lack of insight don't add up. We've had limited face-to-face  me, so I'm le  wondering where these
conclusions come from. If she's basing this on our wri en communica ons alone, she needs to say so explicitly in her report. That's just fair and transparent.
My regular communica on with Chris ne is all there in black and white - it's in our emails. If Jennifer had a problem with this, she should have said something. I've been
upfront about these interac ons from the get-go. If there was an issue, why didn't she speak up?
There's been a lot of confusion about whether I was supposed to stop all communica on with Chris ne. If that was the plan, Jennifer should have made it crystal clear and
hammered it home, especially given that we need to co-parent. You can't just expect parents to stop talking altogether when they have kids to raise.
I reached out on August 28th, asking for clarifica on on what was expected of me communica on-wise. I got radio silence. That's not okay. It shows a breakdown in our
therapeu c rela onship that needs addressing.
If Jennifer's assessments are based on incomplete informa on or she's misinterpre ng our communica ons, that's a serious problem. It calls into ques on the validity of
her en re evalua on. We need to tackle this head-on and get to the bo om of it. Max and Adrian's well-being is at stake here, and we can't afford to get this wrong.
Given these concerns, I might consider:
1. Reques ng a mee ng with Jennifer to discuss these issues directly. I need to understand her perspec ve and share mine openly.
2. Asking Jennifer for a clear, wri en explana on of her assessments and the evidence suppor ng them. This transparency is crucial for rebuilding trust and ensuring
we're all on the same page.
3. Seeking clarifica on on communica on expecta ons going forward. We need to establish clear guidelines to avoid future misunderstandings and ensure everyone's
on the same page.
4. If I'm not sa sfied with Jennifer's response, I might consider a second opinion or poten ally a new therapist. The well-being of Max and Adrian is too important to
leave to chance.
I know that effec ve therapy relies on clear communica on and trust between the therapist and client. If these have been compromised, it's essen al to address these
issues head-on for the sake of my family's progress. I'm commi ed to doing whatever it takes to ensure Max and Adrian have the support and stability they need during
this challenging  me.

So.... Sounds like today was a disaster for me. Apparently the documentation I signed when we started with Jennifer did prohibit me from referring to her or
her recommendations.
I assumed that if we were violating something we signed, Lisa would have caught that. She did not.
I assumed that if she was working with us we could use the work for something. Apparently we can’t.
That is giving me a pretty large WTF face right now.
Then, per below, Jennifer blamed the lack of progress on me, telling Lisa I have not stopped communicating with Christine. She never said that. See email
below.
That is giving me a pretty large WTF face right now.
So instead of focusing on what’s happening and Christine breaking the law, it’s about Jennifer’s agreement and me as the reason it not working.
Meanwhile, you will see in another mail, Max is openly threatening me. And Christine is letting the kids go through our coms. Noting is as it should be. Zero.
Process and procedure over peace and progress...
And we have to have supervision for you and mom.

Hi Jennifer-
Lisa gave me feedback from your discussion today. She shared that we are not stable enough to reunify, and "what I heard" was it might be because I am in
contact with Christine. I am in contact with her. She is equally in contact with me so I was surprised to hear that was an issue. As I mentioned in the email
(further below) in our first post Hong Kong meeting, I agreed to trust you, and I would not send anything to Christine. I did not. I told you, and you said that
you trusted me but wanted to verify. You did. I resisted, even though she did not allow me contact time with my kids during her entire visit with her family in
Hong Kong. But once we met, I thought the black ended then.
Since then, I have noted I have been in touch with her trying to coordinate and resolve issues you are aware of:
8/9: "RE: Appointment Reminder" details my communication with Christine and cooperation on important events.

9/12: "Exit Plan" email refers to recent interactions with Christine regarding visitation and family events.
These emails clearly evidence my ongoing communication with Christine, which is often necessary for co-parenting and addressing urgent family matters.
They show that I'm trying to maintain open communication with you, be open about interactions with Christine, and follow instructions as I understand them.
This also shows that I wasn't told to stop communicating with Christine, or if so, I was not reminded during the ongoing interaction necessary for co-
parenting. I even attempted to improve our relationship by requesting an appointment with you and Christine to discuss divorce counseling, which was
canceled.
In my August 28 email, I said I was getting conflicting messages about how to navigate this situation and needed more specific guidance on communication
expectations. I made this request as clear as I knew how. I hope this clarifies my position and shows my efforts to meet the requirements of reunification.
With all that said, I will entertain the idea that all of the above is false, and I should take the blame. But in exchange, I hope to clear the air and figure out
what I need to start doing instead to turn the tide in an ongoing and ever-worsening disaster. I’m happy to come in and meet to discuss it f2f, if you think I am
the issue.
Side Note: I found the agreement we signed. I sincerely apologize if there was a violation. My motion was only meant to get Christine to follow the residential
agreement, which she has never done. Please accept my apologies for that error in judgment.

So I called to check in on Max, after seeing Christine says that he was not
feeling well for two days in a row. Max answered and immediately addressed
me in an aggressive voice, saying, "Robert, you listen to me, you little
bitch." And said, "I saw you blowing Mom's phone again," which is impossible
since all communication from me is blocked, except through Our Family Wizard
(OFW) or in jointly addressed emails from third parties. I attempted to
clarify this to Max, explaining that I cannot contact Christine directly
outside of these channels. He said I still did and he knew because Christine
91 / 125

allowed him to go through her phone to see all our communications, which
made me very uncomfortable.
Max continued by accusing me of posting pictures of him and his sister,
Elsa, online to go after Christine, which I believe was prompted by the
misinformation from Elsa from Mom on Monday when had confronted me with a
similar accusation. I tried to explain the situation, but Max insisted that
Elsa could not be wrong and called me a "big fucking liar." At that point, I
suggested we talk another time and hung up, similar to Elsa. Shortly after,
Max called me back. I should have let the call go to voicemail but chose to
answer. He was shouting the same "Robert" insults and then escalated the
situation by saying that he and Elsa would "never forgive me" and that they
were "going to make me pay for this shit."
I don't know if he has tried to text or call again because he is still
blocked. But I mentioned this morning that I did not think this was a safe
situation anymore. And it scares me because of the level of intensity and
sincere hostility after going so long with no issues at all. I know this all
just came out of left field unless it is motivated by my ask to start
following the residential plan and now they are all trying to protect mom.
That is the only thing I can even think of. Obviously, I am going to steer
clear altogether now, but tonight's threats made by Max, especially when
combined with the involvement of Elsa, seem way over the line. The situation
is very scary, kinetic, and unstable. I fear for both Adrian and myself now.
Do I need to document this in more detail than this? Do I need to tell
anyone official, like the police as a non-emergency call?
Side Note: Max has sent me to the hospital before, coming at me in front of
Mom and AD. So, I have seen what he can do when he is upset enough to try
and physically hurt me. It's not pretty. And like last time, I am not going
to fight back, he is my son.

situation by saying that he and Elsa would "never forgive me" and that they
were "going to make me pay for this shit." 
 
I don't know if he has tried to text or call again because he is still
blocked. But I mentioned this morning that I did not think this was a safe
situation anymore. And it scares me because of the level of intensity and
sincere hostility after going so long with no issues at all. I know this all
just came out of left field unless it is motivated by my ask to start
following the residential plan and now they are all trying to protect mom.
That is the only thing I can even think of. Obviously, I am going to steer
clear altogether now, but tonight's threats made by Max, especially when
92 / 125

combined with the involvement of Elsa, seem way over the line. The situation
is very scary, kinetic, and unstable. I fear for both Adrian and myself now.
 
Do I need to document this in more detail than this? Do I need to tell
anyone official, like the police as a non-emergency call?
 
Side Note: Max has sent me to the hospital before, coming at me in front of
Mom and AD. So, I have seen what he can do when he is upset enough to try
and physically hurt me. It's not pretty. And like last time, I am not going
to fight back, he is my son.

Robert,  I don't know why she is sending you emails about Max.
 
Also I will leave it up to you to decide whether to send to Jennifer.  You
make some good points.

<<Here are my thoughts. This is worse than a failure for reunification. It's
counterproductive. If it helps with Connor, awesome, but this engagement is
a "behavior enabling disaster">>
Hi Jennifer-
 
Lisa gave me feedback from your discussion today. She shared that we are not
stable enough to reunify, and "what I heard" was it might be because I am in
contact with Christine. I am in contact with her. She is equally in contact
with me so I was surprised to hear that was an issue. As I mentioned in the
email below before in our first post Hong-Kong meeting, I agreed to trust
you and not send anything to Christine. I did not. I told you, and you said
that you trusted me but wanted to verify. You did. I resisted, even though
she did not allow me contact time with my kids during her entire visit with
her family in Hong Kong.
 
Then I have also noted I have been in touch with her trying to coordinate
93 / 125

and resolve issues you are aware of:
 
*       8/9: "RE: Appointment Reminder" details my communication with
Christine and cooperation on important events. 
*       8/16: "Urgent For Today" email details direct communication with
Christine during Max's medical emergency. 
*       8/17: "Wed at 4:00?" email includes Christine in the cc, showing
direct inclusion in scheduling communications. 
*       8/20: "Kari Meeting Sunday 8/18" email notes a positive conversation
with Christine after Adrian's therapy session. 
*       8/28: "Parenting Plan History and Last Weekend" email implies
ongoing co-parenting and communication issues.
*       9/6: "Re: Need to cancel appt on Wed 9/11" describes direct
interaction with Christine at Adrian's Curriculum Night. 
*       9/9: "Fwd: Charge failed" email mentions ongoing financial matters
involving Christine affecting your accounts. 
*       9/12: "Exit Plan" email refers to recent interactions with Christine
regarding visitation and family events.
 
These emails clearly evidence my ongoing communication with Christine, which
is often necessary for co-parenting and addressing urgent family matters.
They show that I'm trying to maintain open communication with you, be open
about interactions with Christine, and follow instructions as I understand
them.
 
This also shows that I was not instructed to cease all communication with
Christine or if I was, was not reminded during ongoing interaction necessary
for co-parenting. I even attempted to improve our relationship by requesting
an appointment with you and Christine to discuss divorce counseling, which
was canceled.
 
In my August 28 email, I said I was getting conflicting messages about how
to navigate this complex situation and also needed more specific guidance on
communication expectations. I made this request as clear as I knew how. I
hope this clarifies my position and shows my efforts to meet the
requirements of reunification.
 
With all that said, I will entertain the idea that all of the above is
false, and I should take the blame. But in exchange, I hope to clear the air
and figure out what I need to start doing instead to turn the tide in an
ongoing and ever-worsening disaster. I'm happy to come in and meet to
discuss it f2f, given it sounds like I am the issue.
 
Side Note: I don't remember signing anything that said your work was
confidential and could not be used for anything. If you don't mind sharing
that, I would appreciate it.

Welcome back! I hope you had an amazing time off and were able to recharge.
I'm looking forward to chatting with you again today. I assured you that I
am putting my full faith into you and this process, and I will continue to
do so. 
 
As promised, I have not sent a single communication since we chatted, even
though Christine never stopped. If I needed to share an important upcoming
event, it was forwarded with no comments, which happened a couple of times. 
 
Hong Kong was brutal- No time before, no time after, no time to talk alone
on the phone. Only six hours with Adrian in July. Christine also scheduled a
session Adrian requested and I while I was out of town. Adrian thought I
ignored him. 
 
You own the agenda today, but here are the things that are top of mind for

Lisa had her meeting with Jennifer. She said we still can’t even start
reunification because I have been communicating with Christine. When the
fuck did that rule go into effect and why didn’t she say something? Total

<<Here are my thoughts. This is worse than a failure for reunification.
It’s counterproductive. If it helps with Connor, awesome, but this
engagement is a “behavior enabling disaster”>>
Hi Jennifer-
 
Lisa gave me feedback from your discussion today. She shared that we are
not stable enough to reunify, and "what I heard" was it might be because I
am in contact with Christine. I am in contact with her. She is equally in
contact with me so I was surprised to hear that was an issue. As I mentioned
in the email below before in our first post Hong-Kong meeting, I agreed to
trust you and not send anything to Christine. I did not. I told you, and you
said that you trusted me but wanted to verify. You did. I resisted, even
though she did not allow me contact time with my kids during her entire
visit with her family in Hong Kong.
 
Then I have also noted I have been in touch with her trying to coordinate
and resolve issues you are aware of:
 
*       8/9: "RE: Appointment Reminder" details my communication with
Christine and cooperation on important events. 
*       8/16: "Urgent For Today" email details direct communication with
Christine during Max's medical emergency. 
*       8/17: "Wed at 4:00?" email includes Christine in the cc, showing
direct inclusion in scheduling communications. 
*       8/20: "Kari Meeting Sunday 8/18" email notes a positive conversation
with Christine after Adrian's therapy session. 
*       8/28: "Parenting Plan History and Last Weekend" email implies
ongoing co-parenting and communication issues.
*       9/6: "Re: Need to cancel appt on Wed 9/11" describes direct
interaction with Christine at Adrian's Curriculum Night. 
*       9/9: "Fwd: Charge failed" email mentions ongoing financial matters
involving Christine affecting your accounts. 
*       9/12: "Exit Plan" email refers to recent interactions with Christine
regarding visitation and family events.
 
These emails clearly evidence my ongoing communication with Christine,
which is often necessary for co-parenting and addressing urgent family
matters. They show that I'm trying to maintain open communication with you,
be open about interactions with Christine, and follow instructions as I
understand them.
 
This also shows that I was not instructed to cease all communication with
Christine or if I was, was not reminded during ongoing interaction necessary
for co-parenting. I even attempted to improve our relationship by requesting
an appointment with you and Christine to discuss divorce counseling, which
was canceled.
 
In my August 28 email, I said I was getting conflicting messages about how
to navigate this complex situation and also needed more specific guidance on
communication expectations. I made this request as clear as I knew how. I
hope this clarifies my position and shows my efforts to meet the
requirements of reunification.
104 / 125

 
With all that said, I will entertain the idea that all of the above is
false, and I should take the blame. But in exchange, I hope to clear the air
and figure out what I need to start doing instead to turn the tide in an
ongoing and ever-worsening disaster. I’m happy to come in and meet to
discuss it f2f, given it sounds like I am the issue.
 
Side Note: I don’t remember signing anything that said your work was
confidential and could not be used for anything. If you don’t mind sharing
that, I would appreciate it.

Welcome back! I hope you had an amazing time off and were able to recharge.
I'm looking forward to chatting with you again today. I assured you that I
am putting my full faith into you and this process, and I will continue to
do so. 
 
As promised, I have not sent a single communication since we chatted, even
though Christine never stopped. If I needed to share an important upcoming
event, it was forwarded with no comments, which happened a couple of times. 
 
Hong Kong was brutal- No time before, no time after, no time to talk alone
on the phone. Only six hours with Adrian in July. Christine also scheduled a
session Adrian requested and I while I was out of town. Adrian thought I
ignored him.

Hi Jennifer-
Lisa gave me feedback from your discussion today. She shared that we are not stable enough to reunify, and it felt like it might be because I am in contact
with Christine. I am in contact with her. She is equally in contact with me. I was surprised to hear that was an issue. Per the below, between our
appointments, she was not allowing any contact with my kids. I agreed to trust you and not send anything to Christine. I did not. I told you, and you said that
you trusted me but wanted to verify. You did.
At no point did I hear that was a “forever” policy. It was to cool down for the weeks between our visits. If I had heard, I would have asked how we
communicated because that would have been unworkable at that stage. Even as it is, she has violated signed mediation agreements and our residential
agreement. I am also surprised that it would not have come up when I shared that she and I had made an appointment with you to work on “us” because our
communication had improved so much.
So If I did something that you said not to do, I am very surprised and can confirm I never heard and also demonstrated there was continued communication.
The other thing I would like to understand is the signed agreement that your work is to be confidential and can’t be used. I trust I did, but don’t remember
that.
Thanks,
robert

Welcome back! I hope you had an amazing time off and were able to recharge.
I'm looking forward to chatting with you again today. I assured you that I
am putting my full faith into you and this process, and I will continue to
do so. 
 
As promised, I have not sent a single communication since we chatted, even
though Christine never stopped. If I needed to share an important upcoming
event, it was forwarded with no comments, which happened a couple of times. 
112 / 125

 
Hong Kong was brutal- No time before, no time after, no time to talk alone
on the phone. Only six hours with Adrian in July. Christine also scheduled a
session Adrian requested and I while I was out of town. Adrian thought I
ignored him. 
 
You own the agenda today, but here are the things that are top of mind for
me. 
 
Zero communication with Christine
 
 
Recent concerns with Adrian 
 
 
When Adrian sees his Father

Hong Kong was brutal- No time before, no time after, no time to talk alone
on the phone. Only six hours with Adrian in July. Christine also scheduled a
session Adrian requested and I while I was out of town. Adrian thought I
ignored him. 
 
You own the agenda today, but here are the things that are top of mind for
me. 
 
Zero communication with Christine
 
 
Recent concerns with Adrian 
 
 
When Adrian sees his Father

Welcome back! I hope you had an amazing time off and were able to recharge.
I'm looking forward to chatting with you again today. I assured you that I
am putting my full faith into you and this process, and I will continue to
do so.
As promised, I have not sent a single communication since we chatted, even
though Christine never stopped. If I needed to share an important upcoming
event, it was forwarded with no comments, which happened a couple of times.
