We've had limited face-to-face \u0000me, so I'm le\u0000 wondering where these\nconclusions come from. If she's basing this on our wri\u0000en communica\u0000ons alone, she needs to say so explicitly in her report. That's just fair and transparent.\nMy regular communica\u0000on with Chris\u0000ne is all there in black and white - it's in our emails. If Jennifer had a problem with this, she should have said something. I've been\nupfront about these interac\u0000ons from the get-go. If there was an issue, why didn't she speak up?\nThere's been a lot of confusion about whether I was supposed to stop all communica\u0000on with Chris\u0000ne. If that was the plan, Jennifer should have made it crystal clear and\nhammered it home, especially given that we need to co-parent. You can't just expect parents to stop talking altogether when they have kids to raise.\nI reached out on August 28th, asking for clarifica\u0000on on what was expected of me communica\u0000on-wise. I got radio silence. That's not okay. It shows a breakdown in our\ntherapeu\u0000c rela\u0000onship that needs addressing.\nIf Jennifer's assessments are based on incomplete informa\u0000on or she's misinterpre\u0000ng our communica\u0000ons, that's a serious problem. It calls into ques\u0000on the validity of\nher en\u0000re evalua\u0000on. We need to tackle this head-on and get to the bo\u0000om of it. Max and Adrian's well-being is at stake here, and we can't afford to get this wrong.\nGiven these concerns, I might consider:\n\nwe're all on the same page.\n\non the same page.\n\nleave to chance.\nI know that effec\u0000ve therapy relies on clear communica\u0000on and trust between the therapist and client.
