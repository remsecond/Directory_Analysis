I have no idea if this will ever be relevant but I am sharing the mail\nresponse I got from her today with a super bill and a diagnosis code from our sessions. The only reason I think it might be\nrelevant is that Christine and Yurushka had been secretly meeting before our joint meetings to work on DV strategy. It's a\nlong story I won't repeat it. But ever since then, Christine has always told me that Yurushka justified their covert\ntriangulation because our situation was interpreted as DV and presented imminent harm to her and the family. This even\nthough we were still going on regular fancy dates, were at the absolute peak of our married intimate relations, doing\nshrooms together on the weekends, and Yurushak was recommending we all have regular family dinners. Christine has said\nDebbie Bayer (our couples counselor) and Dr Mo Brown (parenting plan consultant), have said it's DV too. Then she starts\nthe threats to use DV in court if I don't go along with whatever her ask is that day. It's a painful pattern.\nI'll put on my big boy pants and just deal with it. Lots of crazy stuff is said between us. But, if it ever comes up in a court\nsetting that we do not want, I thought it might be good to share the actual diagnosis code for the therapy  Yurushka\nconducted. Because it seems to officially reflect our obvious martial conflict and not DV. Again, hope this is never relevant.\nAs I understand:\n\nThe diagnosis code \"Z63.0\" is used to specify problems in a relationship with a spouse or partner to indicate\ninterpersonal conflicts, misunderstandings, and emotional disconnects in a relationship.\nAnd then \"ICD-10\" codes that are used to indicate domestic violence are\n\"Z69.11\": Used for encounters for mental health services for victims of spousal or partner abuse\n\"W86.0XXA\": Another code associated with domestic violence\n\"T74.11XA\": A billable/specific ICD-10-CM code that can be used to indicate a diagnosis of adult physical abuse,\nconfirmed\nAttached herewith is the superbill.\nKind regards,\n\n=== Subject: Re: Invoices\nFrom: Yurushka Martin <yurushka@yurushkamartincounseling.com>\nTo: christine moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>,Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nDate Sent: Friday, January 12, 2024 1:06:54 PM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Friday, January 12, 2024 1:07:06 PM GMT-08:00\nAttachments: SB #0340.pdf\nAttached herewith is the superbill.\nKind regards,\n\n=== Subject: Re: Invoices\nFrom: Yurushka Martin <yurushka@yurushkamartincounseling.com>\nTo: christine moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>,Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nDate Sent: Friday, January 12, 2024 1:04:53 PM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Friday, January 12, 2024 1:05:03 PM GMT-08:00\nHi Christine and Rob,\nAs per your request, I have created a superbill with diagnosis code for possible insurance reimbursement.

I did not.\nWhat I said was \"Logistically you make the rules on how this happens, and I am happy to go along with\nthem. If there is confusion, I am happy to facetime to answer any questions\"\nThat is not a demand to be in the house. It is the opposite of a demand to be in the house and even offers a logical\nalterna\u0000ve to being in the house via a Face\u0000me call.\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Sunday, January 14, 2024 9:42 AM\nTo: Chris\u0000ne Moyer <chris\u0000nemoyer@hotmail.com>\nCc: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\n<<I got a \"message undeliverable\" the first two times?>>\nOk.
