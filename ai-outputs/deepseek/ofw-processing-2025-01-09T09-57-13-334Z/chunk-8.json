I've told anyone who will listen\nhow much our oldest (Max) has enjoyed his first year as part of your community. Historically, as a big STEM kid, Christine\nand I had to make a leap of faith, choosing SAAS over Tesla, and we could not be happier with our decision. Thank you for\ndoing such a great job meeting him where he is and developing and inspiring new areas of interest!\nBatting .500 in baseball is incredible. But if it's your average choosing the right school for your kids, it's awful.\nUnfortunately, that's where we find ourselves. We believed in the fall, Adrian would be better suited to another school based\non the STEM program and his best friends attending the same school. After a few months, however, the difference in\nexperiences is so profound we would like to see if there is any opportunity to have Adrian join the SAAS community.\nNaturally, SAAS may be fully booked, and a mid-year transfer may be a pipe dream. It might also be\ndevelopmentally inappropriate without the proper care. But Christine and I would love to discuss what SAAS may see as a\npossible path to join the community in the near or medium term. This is not a decision we take lightly. Moving from ICS to\nSAAS might create new challenges for us. But we would love to discuss if it is even possible and /or appropriate for Adrian.\n\n- best\nChristine & Robert\n\n=== Subject: Re: Backcountry Ski Trip Info\nFrom: christine moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nTo: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>,Hannah LeBlanc <hleblanc@seattleacademy.org>\nDate Sent: Tuesday, January 16, 2024 10:20:31 AM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Tuesday, January 16, 2024 10:20:34 AM GMT-08:00\nHi Hannah,\nCan you advise what we need to do to se\u0000le up the rental and how we can do the same rental for the upcoming trip?\nRegards,\nChris\u0000ne\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, January 5, 2024 2:07 PM\nTo: chris\u0000ne moyer <chris\u0000nemoyer@hotmail.com>; Hannah LeBlanc <hleblanc@sea\u0000leacademy.org>\n\nAwesome!!!
