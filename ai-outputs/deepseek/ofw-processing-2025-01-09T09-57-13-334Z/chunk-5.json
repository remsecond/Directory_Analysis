That said, over the last two days, Christine and I have both spent\nconsiderable time with a therapist who is currently acting in a  lightweight way as our GAL to make recommendations for a\ntemporary parenting plan that we can use till official mediation happens. During those conversations, she offered to make\nsome recommendations for how we approach therapy for Max and Adrian appropriately, considering her work. So if we\ncould circle back next week, that would be ideal.

We would be interested in discussing what role you could play with regard to\nchildren's therapy for Max (15) and Adrian (11). Christine and I are currently separated and admittedly not on the best terms\nafter 29 years together, so we would like to understand how a professional with your background might provide some\ntherapeutic assistance for our kids in this difficult time. We can naturally discuss our situation and concerns in more detail if\nyou think you might be able to help us with our shared concern for their well-being.\nPlease let us know!\n\nbest\nrobert & Christine\n\n=== Subject: Re: You are getting the next 3 months of Peacock TV for $2.99\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nTo: Christine Moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nDate Sent: Monday, January 22, 2024 10:07:15 AM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Monday, January 22, 2024 10:07:16 AM GMT-08:00\nHulu is about to expire.

I thought one was Max's new set but I don't know which one) Dyson fan, speakers from living room,\nbig bean bag from man cave, Lees old golf clubs, snow blower.\nCan they take peloton and you sell from your place? I'm not comfortable trying to list and meet someone for sale. I've\nstopped selling items on CL.\nI planned to pack up all the bbq tools from kitchen.\nI am going to pack up computer closet as well. I likely won't get to that until a later date.\nAssume you will want tools from garage , tool chest, saw table,\nIt's a big run so I guess we will see size of lugg truck.\nIf Monday am, it will give you Monday to unpack and sort but that's my two cents.\nGet\nOutlook for iOS\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Tuesday, January 2, 2024 10:55:07 AM\nTo: Chris\u0000ne Moyer <chris\u0000nemoyer@hotmail.com>\nCc: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\n\nPer our discussion, I think this is what we discussed and additional ideas I had. Open to feedback. As mentioned,\nwe can use the moving service app for some quick hits and then work on a longer-term plan. We also need to\nfigure out the former love nest clean/move.\nShared Furniture to minimize cash outlay\nTVs : Sitting room & Deck (might ask to swap one for living room TV).\nFurniture: I will move our sitting room and guest room stuff to new place\nPatio: We agree it's not used, so I will take, but we can truly divide in mediation.\nGrills: Happy to share these if you like. The beach grill would be great for ya.\nMisc: bean bag? exercise stuff? art? pillows? desk? Is there anything in the man cave?\nKitchen: Realistic division of shared assets, I think you are working on that\nDecorations: We can work together in the near term and use long-term mediation.\n\nLinens/Towels: I have a bunch from the beach, but I will want nice stuff. Suggestions?\nOther furniture for consideration\nMaster bedroom: I can use beach stuff as a temp option. We swap the mattresses\nDining Table: I can use the beach one as a temp. The chairs have to go, though.\nBeach Couch/Chair: I'll keep my chair and use the couch till we get something better.\nBeach Bean Bag: I'll find a place to use that somewhere, do we have an extra at home?\nKids bedroom set: I can use the one at the beach for AD, and use the guest for Max\nOne kid's desk: We need two. I'll take the beach one and find a new one (1210 or Craigslist)\nTV room sectional. You keep ours. I will rent or buy. Hopefully, it's the only cash outlay.\nKids \"fun stuff\" I may think about\nElectronics: PCs, Monitors, gaming (we have some of this)\nPlay: CL or Amazon \"Pop a shot\" game?\nPlay: CL or Amazon Basketball hoop?\nPlay: CL or Amazon Ping Pong table?\nPets: Fish/Gerbils/Cat/Dog?\nI want to be super clear- I still prefer to nest as we said. This will be much more expensive. But, I understand your concerns\nand wish things that happened since July had not happened, making it so hard. But I still want to work with you so we are\nnot forced to do dumb fiscal things again.\n\n=== Subject: Re: Dad on the Eastside in 2024\nFrom: christine moyer <christinemoyer@hotmail.com>\nTo: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nDate Sent: Sunday, January 14, 2024 7:57:26 AM GMT-08:00\nDate Received: Sunday, January 14, 2024 7:57:28 AM GMT-08:00\nI packed up the entire guest bedroom which was all your stuff. Most was in boxes anyway that you piled into the closet. Also\nall the clothes from that closet, all your jackets and clothes from dresser in bedroom. Shoes from cabinet and dresser as\nwell.\nI’d like to hold the guest bed and frame for a bit. I’m putting Adrian in there while we redo/rearrange his room. Let me know\nif issue.\nI put items in suitcases that are yours and gave you another big one and small one to divide.\nI'm going to leave items in bedside table as that will be swapped.\nSo big items are crows nest set, grill, smoker, egg, your bike (are there two?) and bike rack, acrylic table from old office,\nskis (are there 3 sets? I thought one was Max's new set but I don't know which one) Dyson fan, speakers from living room,\nbig bean bag from man cave, Lees old golf clubs, snow blower.\nCan they take peloton and you sell from your place? I'm not comfortable trying to list and meet someone for sale. I've\nstopped selling items on CL.\nI planned to pack up all the bbq tools from kitchen.\nI am going to pack up computer closet as well. I likely won't get to that until a later date.\nAssume you will want tools from garage , tool chest, saw table,\nIt's a big run so I guess we will see size of lugg truck.\nIf Monday am, it will give you Monday to unpack and sort but that's my two cents.\nGet\nOutlook for iOS\nFrom: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>\nSent: Tuesday, January 2, 2024 10:55:07 AM\nTo: Chris\u0000ne Moyer <chris\u0000nemoyer@hotmail.com>\nCc: Rob Moyer <rob.moyer@gmail.com>",
