You did not respond.\nShould I assume that moving forward we just go through lawyers from now on? My hope from the discussion on the 19th was we would begin\nto work together a little more cooperatively.

Then this landed. Going back and forth\nacross platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.\nI will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that\nthis is super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.\nOn 12/26/2024 at 01:52 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2024 at 01:53 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nMy BofA is\nAccount: 13833331026\nRouting: 125000024\nI see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.\nSafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a\nminimum.\nThank you.\nOn 12/26/2024 at 01:33 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2024 at 01:45 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nSo I put $500 in this AM because it looked overdrawn.

If you share your fidelity and BofA account numbers I can set those up.. but now that I say that I think I\nhave the BofA already because I transfer the 2.1k .... I’m a little lost. I’ll work on this\nOn 12/26/2024 at 01:29 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/26/2024 at 01:29 PM)\nSubject:Re: Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer\nIt looks like it transferred out of the Jt account and not in.",
