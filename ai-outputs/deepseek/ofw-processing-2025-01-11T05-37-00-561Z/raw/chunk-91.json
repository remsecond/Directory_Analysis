Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his communications to others, not just me.\nI was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into\nmediation so there should have been no surprise.\nBelow is blaming me again.",
