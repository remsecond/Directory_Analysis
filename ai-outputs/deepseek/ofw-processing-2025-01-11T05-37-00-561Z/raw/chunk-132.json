I’m only advocating for equality between our children. That’s all- equal treatment between two brothers.\nI hope you will please consider equality over inequity.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 05:06 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 05:08 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nPlease stop.

That is why it has to be tonight. If one call in four months (a rate of 3 a year) is too much for\nsomething of this magnitude. Then there will never be anything that meets the bar.\nIf you don’t let me chat , you see blame, because that is what you are making up. I am not blaming you. I am asking for a peaceful and\nconstructive discussion. May we please take a minute to even check if\nIt’s worth a longer conversation.\nJust putting our heads in the sand won’t help him.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 04:54 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:54 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nI do understand you have a different perspective.\nThis is still too raw. My suggestion is we step back for a bit. All I see is blame on me.\nThis has been signed is my understanding.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 04:33 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 04:49 PM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nWould you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly\nwhen we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.\nBefore this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.\nSomething that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.",
