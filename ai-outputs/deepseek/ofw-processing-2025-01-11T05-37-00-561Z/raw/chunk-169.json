He confirmed I did not as it\nfell during winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.\nOn 12/10/2024 at 07:26 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 09:44 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nSorry.

I’ll send over the travel authorization as well.\nMessage 70 of 287\nI don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't help us\nunless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.\nThe SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the regular\nschedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.\nLet's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?\nSent:12/10/2024 at 10:08 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/10/2024 at 10:37 AM)\nSubject:Re: SAAS backcountry\nAttachments:Winter_Break_2024.jpg (141 KB)",
