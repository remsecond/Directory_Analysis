The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple\noccasions.\nAll attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution\nnow is to formally split it.\nOn 11/29/2024 at 11:34 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 11/29/2024 at 12:15 PM)\nSubject:Re: SafeCo Car Insurance/Split\nWhy would we do this before we are divorced? Are you just intentionally trying to cost us more? I don’t get you. First I offer anyway possible\nnot to move the boys just for their own good and you won’t let me keep you in the house even when you benefit, you have to make a big deal\nout of us being divorce to SAAS because that is in their best interest somehow, and now this. I assume you wanna file separately instead of his\nmarried too?\nOn 11/29/2024 at 11:30 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 11/29/2024 at 11:31 AM)\nSubject:SafeCo Car Insurance/Split\nI called SafeCo to understand how to split our car insurance policies.\nIt was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I\nconfirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.\nWe will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.\nMoving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.\nThe sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.\nMonthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.\nMessage 16 of 287\nI’m ok doing that for now assuming there is no dispute about amounts or it just gets messy staying in this state.\nI left message for Alex to have autopayment pull from jt account on Dec 10.\nSee Safeco tab in the shared workbook which breaks it down. Yours is 532, mine is 225. We should both deposit that in the joint account.\nYou had requested the SafeCo breakdown in an email sent by your lawyers during the last mediation.\nCan you confirm no further questions or issues on this. If you are good, I’ll transfer my share into BofA.\nSent:12/02/2024 at 02:47 PM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 02:48 PM)\nSubject:Re: SafeCo Car Insurance/Split",
