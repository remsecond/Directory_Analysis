Any concerns\nsplitting that bill. It was 208. I forwarded email to you which has all details and will set up the annual inspection which is included in the\ncontract to check crawl space.\nOn 12/02/2024 at 02:59 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/02/2024 at 03:55 PM)\nSubject:House repairs/ tree/yard\nGreg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.\nTo approve:\nGreg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.\nKelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and\nwider. Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would\nneed to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.\nMoss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by\nScott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.\nMessage 93 of 287\nI mentioned that it was hard to understand. Just giving me the totals I owe is still not great. Can you enumerate line items in such a way that I can\nhave Lisa compare to our agreement? Even if it is just a screen cap of the excel sheet that I noted that I was struggling with.\nSent:12/11/2024 at 09:29 PM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 06:30 AM)\nSubject:Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31",
