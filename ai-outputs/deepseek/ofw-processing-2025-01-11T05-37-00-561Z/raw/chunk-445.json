Could you send that over?\nIf you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.\nThank you.\nMessage 263 of 287\nDoes he know he’s coming over?\nLast Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said you\nwon’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.\nAlso not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was kinda\nteasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.\nMaybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of clown. I\nknow you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.\nSent:12/28/2024 at 09:01 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject:AD is asleep",
