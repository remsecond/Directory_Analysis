Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we\ncould keep our running list format.\nNow issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list\nmeeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.\nI want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest\nsomething better than what we know works.\nHappy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to\npush back on something that clearly does not.\nOur inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need\nthe help you have refused for over a year now.\nI don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for\nsomething different. I want “>31” instead.\nPlease stop the crazy.
