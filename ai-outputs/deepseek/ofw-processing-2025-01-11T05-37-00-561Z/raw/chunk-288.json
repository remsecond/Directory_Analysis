Was it supposed to be 9986, if we split 19972? I think it was less because of your hair\ndebit card purchase of 299.\nI also saw there was a dividend from msft come into the fidelity msft account.\nCan you split the dividend of 2892 52% 48%? and transfer to my account so I would receive 1,503.\nThank you!\nMessage 129 of 287\nThanks.
