I approached you in the\ngym and asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.\nAnd per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child\nsupport, I said it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”\nI have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already.\nAnd I offered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.\nWhat is getting lost in translation? I have said this will happen with lawyers as the go between since last year. Why would we turn over every\ndetail to hired guns? Come on Christine, please work with me.\nWhat we are doing does not work. It never has. >31\nOn 12/12/2024 at 03:57 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/13/2024 at 07:25 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nWell why don’t we both stop and figure out what preserves Max and Adrian’s well being. I can make some proposals that don’t impact you\nnegatively.\nAnd if you think that my side has the wherewithal to do what you do, I’ll just let that go. Is Natalie going to GPM product teams to bring in\nseven figures?\nLet’s stop and work together. That is all I was asking. But we can’t even have a conversation. I offered twice to help on House and HELOC.\nUnprompted.\nShould we have a discussion? That’s all I’m asking.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nThis is frustrating to receive.\nIt was proposed by your side to structure this way, unprompted by me. There was a trade off.\nYou spent 170k more than me while unemployed . Refused to pay me maintenance and argued for small child support, refusing to pay bills\nowed including max medical. I’m in the red every month.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nSo this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why.
