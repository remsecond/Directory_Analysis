Happy to do that. I’m not fighting over the 52 vs 50
Thanks!

Subject:Fidelity - MSFT Dividend transfer
A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

My BofA is

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.
SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a
minimum.

So I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth across
platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.
I will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that this is
super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.

always on the thread for personal stuff. You did not respond.

Thanks. I was able to send to her. Do you mind confirming that Max got his too? It’s a lot of cash so want to be sure it landed safely. Thanks.

I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?

Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.
SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a

minimum.
Thank you.

So I put $500 in this AM because it looked overdrawn. I’ll try to see whats up but any forensic records you have would be helpful. I would
swear I got it right but but maybe not. If you share your fidelity and BofA account numbers I can set those up.. but now that I say that I think I
have the BofA already because I transfer the 2.1k .... I’m a little lost. I’ll work on this

It looks like it transferred out of the Jt account and not in.

Happy to do that. I’m not fighting over the 52 vs 50
Thanks!

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

Does he know he’s coming over?
Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said you
won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.
Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was kinda
teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.
Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of clown. I
know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.

Yes I can initiate is how I understand.
I don’t want to fight.
The dividend has not landed in my BofA yet.
Reminder Safeco is due early Jan. My portion is in jt BofA but it will bounce as you loved your funds out.
Gardener came for weeding and I will pay him cash of 203 today. Your portion is 100.

So I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we can’t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or
compliance folks always on the thread for personal stuff. You did not respond.
Should I assume that moving forward we just go through lawyers from now on? My hope from the discussion on the 19th was we would begin
to work together a little more cooperatively. Let me know.

So I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth

across platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.
I will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that
this is super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.
