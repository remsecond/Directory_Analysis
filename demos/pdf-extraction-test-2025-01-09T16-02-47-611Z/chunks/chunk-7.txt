I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489

Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489

Remaining $112,739 at 37%

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.
Message 113 of 287
So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first meetings
with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like you
knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been used
for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and you
managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it came
to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC, and
ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. The
kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard
to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this
discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.

Is that correct?

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on
the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been
used for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,
and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t
reciprocated when it came to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,
and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the
IRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so
hard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even
have this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.
Is that correct?

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000
Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000

Difference in amount taxed at 37%: $300,000
Tax Savings: $300,000 × (37% - 35%) = $6,000 direct savings
Plus tax deferral benefit on full $300,000 payment

BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

And tbh- it’s more frustrating because we could not ever talk, even as I practically begged you at ADs basketball game. I approached you in the gym
and asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.
And per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child support, I
said it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”
I have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already. And I
offered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000
Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000
