I’ll review the invoices and pay the larger amount.
There are some other documents that need to be completed that I will be sending over.
I also have the whistler place for the weekend and plan to take the boys. I’ll send over the travel authorization as well.

Yes but Dec 20-23 falls during the winter break.
In mediation I specifically asked Judge Rosen as I thought we had to negotiate these dates to take boys to Whistler. He confirmed I did not as it fell
during winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you do your
portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the cash
balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell stock now
to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

The holidays take priority over regular time.
So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.
I would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys over
Winter Break.

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't help us
unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.
The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the regular
schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.
Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that pull

I pulled from mid winter break language. I understood all breaks start after school.
We can have our lawyers resolve this quickly on when Winter break should start.

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't
help us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.
The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the
regular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.
Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

The holidays take priority over regular time.
So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.

Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.
To approve:
Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.

Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and
wider. Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would
need to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by
Scott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.

Thank you for the update. I did not hear from him.
Next Saturday? He would need to be home by 5:30pm.

Alan called during mediation. He may have talked to you first, but you would have also been in mediation. He can't do Sunday, he is out of
town. Open to suggestions.

So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?

Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

Do you have timing/thoughts for the visit Sunday?
We don’t have details for Sunday basketball game yet but trying to understand if you might have him home prior to game or if you are thinking
go straight to game.

Nope. What’s my share? $104?

Following up on below.
Also Ecopest stopped for quarterly check in to look at mice traps and said a lot of activity, all bait was gone and mouse in one. Any concerns
splitting that bill. It was 208. I forwarded email to you which has all details and will set up the annual inspection which is included in the
contract to check crawl space.
