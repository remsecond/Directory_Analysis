So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!

Hope you are having an awesome time!

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

So I put $500 in this AM because it looked overdrawn. I’ll try to see whats up but any forensic records you have would be helpful. I would swear I got
it right but but maybe not. If you share your fidelity and BofA account numbers I can set those up.. but now that I say that I think I have the BofA
already because I transfer the 2.1k .... I’m a little lost. I’ll work on this

My BofA is
Account: 13833331026
Routing: 125000024
I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.
SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a
minimum.

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

So I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth across
platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.
I will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that this is
super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.

SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a

Does he know he’s coming over?

Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said
you won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.
Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was
kinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.
Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of
clown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.

So I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we can’t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or
compliance folks always on the thread for personal stuff. You did not respond.
Should I assume that moving forward we just go through lawyers from now on? My hope from the discussion on the 19th was we would begin
to work together a little more cooperatively. Let me know.

So I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth
across platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.
I will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that
this is super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.
SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

Christine,
I agree that professional guidance on addressing these situations is valuable. But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like
retaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:
- Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.
- The portrayal to Adrian that I "won't reply" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.
- Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.
- The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.

Yes if you can reimburse the costs from July for kids medical insurance.and other costs that would be great too.

Here is my bank count info. I take back what I said. I was frustrated. Deduct whatever you need.
Account number 138134270432
Routing number

- Paper & Electronic 125000024
- Wires 026009593
I admit I am struggling, knowing you freely say you lied to me for 30 years. That is most of my life, and I have to start all over now. And I still
can't get you to even work with me on rebuilding and being civil—even for the kid's sake.
I have asked every way I know how. I know you have a lot of anger, but you slept on the pillow next to me for 25 years and talked about
growing old together. But every night was a lie. Our whole life was a lie. It's hard to ignore.
I still really wish we would get some help. This way has NOT worked—ever since 2023. Every day that passes under your plan makes it worse,
and the only thing you do is double down. It's like you want to torment me at this stage.
I should know just to quit askingm but I feel like I have to at least try for the kid's sake.

Tickets sold and received 444.23 after commission for last Seahawks game.
I’ll deduct $100 for your share of the gardener and transfer the balance of 122.3 to you for your half.
Can you send me you BofA details?

Adrian was aware of today’s visit.
You stated you would refrain from making jabs at me. They have continued.

Christine,
I agree that professional guidance on addressing these situations is valuable. But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like
retaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:
- Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.
- The portrayal to Adrian that I "won't reply" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.
- Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.
- The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.
Please maintain our message thread rather than forking and creating new ones. Forking threads can misrepresent the context and chronology of
our communication, which has happened a lot since this began. I don't think that is helpful to either of us when seeking helpful advice.
Looking forward to understanding a healthier way to address the points above, as they were not addressed in a constructive way.

Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said
you won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.
Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was
kinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.
Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of
clown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.
