Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000

Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000

Difference in amount taxed at 37%: $300,000
Tax Savings: $300,000 × (37% - 35%) = $6,000 direct savings
Plus tax deferral benefit on full $300,000 payment

Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first meetings
with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like you
knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been used
for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and you
managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it came
to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC, and
ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. The
kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard
to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this
discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)

Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70

Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489

The next payment will be due on Jan 2.

Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the

Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first
meetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I

feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on
the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been
used for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,
and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t
reciprocated when it came to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,
and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the
IRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so
hard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even
have this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

And tbh- it’s more frustrating because we could not ever talk, even as I practically begged you at ADs basketball game. I approached you in the gym
and asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.
And per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child support, I
said it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”
I have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already. And I
offered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.
What is getting lost in translation? I have said this will happen with lawyers as the go between since last year. Why would we turn over every detail to

And tbh- it’s more frustrating because we could not ever talk, even as I practically begged you at ADs basketball game. I approached you in the
gym and asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.
And per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child
support, I said it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”
I have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already.
And I offered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.
What is getting lost in translation? I have said this will happen with lawyers as the go between since last year. Why would we turn over every
detail to hired guns? Come on Christine, please work with me.
What we are doing does not work. It never has. >31

Well why don’t we both stop and figure out what preserves Max and Adrian’s well being. I can make some proposals that don’t impact you
negatively.
And if you think that my side has the wherewithal to do what you do, I’ll just let that go. Is Natalie going to GPM product teams to bring in
seven figures?
Let’s stop and work together. That is all I was asking. But we can’t even have a conversation. I offered twice to help on House and HELOC.
Unprompted.
Should we have a discussion? That’s all I’m asking.

It was proposed by your side to structure this way, unprompted by me. There was a trade off.
You spent 170k more than me while unemployed . Refused to pay me maintenance and argued for small child support, refusing to pay bills

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first
meetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I

feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on
the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been
used for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,
and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t
reciprocated when it came to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,
and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the
IRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so
hard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even
have this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.
Is that correct?

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

I am.
Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000
Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000

Difference in amount taxed at 37%: $300,000
Tax Savings: $300,000 × (37% - 35%) = $6,000 direct savings
Plus tax deferral benefit on full $300,000 payment

Notes below. Thanks for the heads up.
Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

I’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again. Kari and Alan, and of course
AD and me don’t know if plans are changing tomorrow or not.

That puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the
“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.
This makes me feel uncomfortable.

Can we sync on AD plans given he feels crummy?
I would rather him start a bit later in the day and still make it than force an early start to make this time here. And go straight into a session. Just
hearing that already sounds draining to me.
But if we shift it might work better and we can all couch camp. It’s and idea because I don’t want a big backlog of makeups which could
otherwise be Thurs, tomorrow, maybe Whistler Sat... ?

Super frustrating not to be able to get answers to easy q’s. It’s a 30 second call but I wait hours. You know I’m going to respond because I have
milliseconds at best, but you do this anyway.
I finally got us on a call today and overcame weeks of bickering and crossed wires. It got the exact outcome you asked for, most in real time. So I can’t
understand why you don’t see that it works for you too.
Is working with me for the kids just beneath you?

Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.
Is this what was decided last week?

Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.
Is this what was decided last week?

I asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just
continue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion that
would take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that don’t have
the info required to make the determination.
Yesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You refused to
answer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on you to check in
and when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.
I’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with you,
Christine.
If you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help you both

Nutcracker tickets were purchased prior to rescheduling to today. If you plan to weaponize changes in schedule I accommodated against me, that just

I never had a say in a single decision for the Seahawks. I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and energy
to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away tickets that you
transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and expectations are beyond
astounding.

energy to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away
tickets that you transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and
expectations are beyond astounding.

I tried to get the Fidelity account squared away for months after you violated the court order and took half $1/2 million out. And then instead of just
working with me, you decided to go off to Leavenworth to sleep in an Airbnb with folks. That was your priority. That put me in debt and ruined my

Christine, I have done everything humanly possible to work with you. If you have a suggestion of something I did not do please bring it up with me.
Our history is replete  with me asking to turn the page, do something new together to work on behalf of the kids, at least for their mental health.
I stressed this again on the 10th. But you were busy with girls night as your priority. Then I followed up last week addressing every concern you had.
Now we have 35 response long OFW thread trying to figure out AD’s time instead of a 30 second phone call. He missed Kari and went home early.
“Let me think about it,” that’s all you have said for over a year. My assumption is that it will go for many more years. Nothing changes with you.
I am always nice in front of AD, I don’t scream or wag my finger “we are at war.” That’s not good for him. I want him to love the part of them that is
you.
How would you like to handle tonight? Do we show him that we put him first? That’s what I would propose. You have seen I do that. Your call.

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or never
saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids future. As a
byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what we will
do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.

I would be interested in seeing what they recommend.
I am also going to talk to my therapist on Wednesday about your proposal.

Ok... but please consider what we discussed. We don’t need someone else to tell us. Please let me know. We are adults too, and I am glad she
agrees, but lets take our life back, make decisions on our own in the interests of our kids, and let them help us rather than letting anyone be the
puppet master.
I am only asking:
- Get you in touch with sound practices
- have a pro help us learn how to work together
What is the worst thing that can happen? She says “hey, quit seeking professional help to be better parents?” I think at that point she actually
takes over and drives that engagement. That is her job imho.

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better
parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or
never saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids
future. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what
we will do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.
We moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.

Can you transfer my 52% of the 2,892 msft dividend paid on Dec 12 that remains in the account. 52% is equal to 1,503.
There is less in the account now as you have some personal expenses deducting from it.
If you are still confirming with Lisa if it is 50/50 split versus a 52/48 split, can you transfer 1,446 now then wait for confirmation.
There was also a deposit of 14.959 shares on Dec 2. My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what
Lisa view on this as this will impact future drops.
Thank you

You have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we could
keep our running list format.
Now issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list
meeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.
I want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest
something better than what we know works.
Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to push
back on something that clearly does not.
Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need the
help you have refused for over a year now.
I don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for
something different. I want “>31” instead.

Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m not
doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for the wrong
things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.
The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when you
said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a mistake, agreeing
to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.
If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim example. And
him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?
So I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”

has worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.
It's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you just let

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough to
send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were screen
captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we should
perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.
Of course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.

I thought we were going to discuss decisions before you unilaterally made them for the children.
Should I ask for an interpretation or are you just ignoring our court order again?

The last statement is harassment and in violation of the TRO.
Your email to me on erectile dysfunction pills violates the TRO as well.

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough
to send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were
screen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we
should perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.
Of course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via the
Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final decision
based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't expect
that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely disqualifies him
for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind sharing the
plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I can also
help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge. Let's make

Adrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.

Just connected with Alan. He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How
should I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?
I think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally

You didn’t really answer the question. Especially, if you envision a place for me in his life for academic discussions. I did get him into SAAS so
maybe that’s all you wanted after he got rejected. So let me know.

Adrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.
And given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via
the Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final
decision based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't

expect that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely
disqualifies him for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind
sharing the plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I
can also help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.

So please accept my sincerest apologies for my response to this original email, which surprised me. That is not an excuse- my response was
inappropriate and uncalled for.  As mentioned, if the original email was sent from me, it was not intentional. I hope you will forgive me for that and
my uncalled-for escalation. We have enough history and scar tissue to last a lifetime. I will do my best to cooperate with you and seek to de-escalate

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough
to send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were
screen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we
should perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.

I thought we were going to discuss decisions before you unilaterally made them for the children.
Should I ask for an interpretation or are you just ignoring our court order again?

Since this is three days in a row, I honestly don't think I can afford it at $3k. These are killing me.
I'd like Thursday, skip Friday and bank it for the 45-day hold in the PP, and have Sat as planned.

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it up, and I
think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a sleepover.
This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?

So I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts
for us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

Ah... it had to come from Fidelity... to BofA.
That’s probably right. I sent the details in email.
I also asked if that was ok but you didn’t answer.

I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!
