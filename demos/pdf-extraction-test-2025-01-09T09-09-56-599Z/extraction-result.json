Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then\nnothing he says will matter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how\nclose you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my\nproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation.

I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity.

From the very beginning, even in our first meetings\nwith Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like you\nknew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been used\nfor Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and you\nmanaged those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it came\nto dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC, and\nensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. The\nkids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard\nto build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this\ndiscussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nSent:12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM\nFrom:Robert Moyer\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.\n\nSo..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about\nAdrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his\nrelationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about\nspending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he\ndoes.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost\nsomething so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It’s going to be such a tough conversation.

You did that this summer as well when he\ntold two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n\nMax (16):\n- Full autonomy over relationship\n- Direct communication with both parents\n- Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n- No supervision requirements\n- No phase requirements\n- Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n- No autonomy until age 18\n- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n- Must follow rigid phase system\n- Maximum contact permanently reduced\n- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian\nthe free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also\ncould create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till\nadulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\n\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject:Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice.

Ever.\nBefore this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.\nSomething that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same.

He doesn’t.\nBut taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are\nabout that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.\nIt was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will.

You did that this summer as well\nwhen he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n\nMax (16):\n- Full autonomy over relationship\n- Direct communication with both parents\n- Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n- No supervision requirements\n- No phase requirements\n- Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n- No autonomy until age 18\n- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n- Must follow rigid phase system\n- Maximum contact permanently reduced\n- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this.

Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from those\ngains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer but that was\nspeculation on our part.

From the very beginning, even in our first\nmeetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I\n\nfeel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on\nthe scoreboard.\nYou and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been\nused for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,\nand you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t\nreciprocated when it came to dividing things up.\nI understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,\nand ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the\nIRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.\nI’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so\nhard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even\nhave this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31\nOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.\nThe gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when\nyou said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a\nmistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.\nIf you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim\nexample. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?\nSo I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”\nOn 12/17/2024 at 02:56 PM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:58 PM)\nSubject:Re: Running List\nWe have to use OFW.\nThe running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.\nSaying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context of what was happening.\nThe DV was real and confirmed.\nYou have all info and feedback on finances as requested.\nOn 12/17/2024 at 12:55 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/17/2024 at 02:41 PM)\nSubject:Running List\nYou have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries.

Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely\ndisqualifies him for advanced placement in math.\nThis is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead.
