I think I’m happy with the legwork you did with Jeff.
Want to just bait till the same list window for the house? We can decide then if we like?

Subject:Condo Sale
Questions:
Is Jan 15th listing a hard list date or open to list Spring (Feb/March/April) based on Jeff recommendation.
Home/Condo Sale agreement - Suggest add language "List by Jan 15th, or based on list date recommended by agent"
Jeff Conversation Summary

Has not seen big change or reduction in rates post election.
Current listings in Kirkland after election, has not seen much activity.
Does not anticipate much movement in activity or rates between now and end of year.
But could move if priced right.
List by date Jan 15 - could sit for a few months if beginning of year.
Activity picks up mid Feb/March - there is stigma if sits too long.
Recommend wait to list Feb/March/April
Tenant - What options do we want to give him?
He is on month to month, would need to give him a 30 day notice.
Jeff offered to approach the tenant to discuss options and what he wants. Should time discussion appropriately so tenant does not move too
early if wants to leave.
Stay until it sells?
Don't expect too many people
Online appointment/need to coordinate
Stay and perhaps investor? (Mature man/stable job)
Vacate?
99% of listings for sale, are offering to pay the buyers commission 2.5% to 3%.
Buyers' agent - need to have buyers' agreement - this could include buyer pays them 3%.
Buyers agent may insist on difference and could be negotiating point for seller to pay the difference, or buyer will pay.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Message 4 of 287
That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands with me.
I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads. Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what he
does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Message 5 of 287
So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?
Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

Message 14 of 287
Safeco called me back and I spoke to Alex.

My take away.
As you are not at the Kirkland residence, you would need to call and request separate policy for your car at existing residence. I can’t do it as I am still
in the Kirkland residence.
I would remain on existing policy, but my rate would adjust after you drop off.
We would then need to figure split payment of earthquake or I guess we could request that be a separate policy too and figure out payment.
Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple

All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution

It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.

I’m ok doing that for now assuming there is no dispute about amounts or it just gets messy staying in this state.
I left message for Alex to have autopayment pull from jt account on Dec 10.
See Safeco tab in the shared workbook which breaks it down. Yours is 532, mine is 225. We should both deposit that in the joint account.
You had requested the SafeCo breakdown in an email sent by your lawyers during the last mediation.
Can you confirm no further questions or issues on this. If you are good, I’ll transfer my share into BofA.

Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple
occasions.
All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution
now is to formally split it.

Why would we do this before we are divorced? Are you just intentionally trying to cost us more? I don’t get you. First I offer anyway possible
not to move the boys just for their own good and you won’t let me keep you in the house even when you benefit, you have to make a big deal

out of us being divorce to SAAS because that is in their best interest somehow, and now this. I assume you wanna file separately instead of his

I called SafeCo to understand how to split our car insurance policies.
It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.
Monthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.

Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.
To approve:
Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.
Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and wider.
Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would need to fix if
damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by Scott
(Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We have
discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the language
used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I

Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes

-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him, even
well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about
Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his
relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about
spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he
does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost
something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if my
parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as they were,
they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:

Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family

I am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I asked was
if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over. He will reach
Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then nothing he says will
matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how close you
and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my proposal btw)
but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.
So just asking - did you take a vote again?

I was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into mediation
so there should have been no surprise.
Below is blaming me again.
I’m looking forward to speaking with Sound  Practices. I understand they were supposed to reach out to me, but I have not heard from them to date.

And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well when he
told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18

- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced

2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian
the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also
could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till
adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood

The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

Would you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly when
we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18. Something
that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are about
that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.

asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.
He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.

So just asking - did you take a vote again?

Subject:What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule

Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship

- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice

2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:

Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

Would you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly
when we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m

asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.
This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):

choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.
Message 53 of 287
Allright. I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can do
whatever you want to him.
I just noted earlier you had said that "Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his
communications to others, not just me."
So given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free will.
AD and his voice will be silent.

Would you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly
when we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.

But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a

This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system

- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice

2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how

Subject:What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy

-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to

If you think you have zero influence on his thoughts I disagree given the history. But I don’t want to fight. You have made it impossible for him to

Allright. I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can
do whatever you want to him.
I just noted earlier you had said that "Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his
communications to others, not just me."
So given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free
will. AD and his voice will be silent.

We agree on the fact that it was signed. I was told to review before it goes to court. That is why I want to discuss in a peaceful and constructive

My ears are open to any suggestions . I’m only advocating for equality between our children. That’s all- equal treatment between two brothers.
I hope you will please consider equality over inequity.

Would you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly
when we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.
This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice

2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality

- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

I am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I
asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.
He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.
So just asking - did you take a vote again?

Subject:What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever

-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't help us

The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the regular
schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.
Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

I’ll review the invoices and pay the larger amount.
There are some other documents that need to be completed that I will be sending over.
I also have the whistler place for the weekend and plan to take the boys. I’ll send over the travel authorization as well.

Notes below. Thanks for the heads up.
Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that pull
from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can help
you.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't
help us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.
The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the
regular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.
Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.
I would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys

In mediation I specifically asked Judge Rosen as I thought we had to negotiate these dates to take boys to Whistler. He confirmed I did not as it
fell during winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't
help us unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.
The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the
regular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.

Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

The holidays take priority over regular time.
So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.
I would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys
over Winter Break.

Yes but Dec 20-23 falls during the winter break.
In mediation I specifically asked Judge Rosen as I thought we had to negotiate these dates to take boys to Whistler. He confirmed I did not as it
fell during winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.

I’can simplify.
Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.
Just let me know if you still have that interpretation.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

Following up on below.
Also Ecopest stopped for quarterly check in to look at mice traps and said a lot of activity, all bait was gone and mouse in one. Any concerns
splitting that bill. It was 208. I forwarded email to you which has all details and will set up the annual inspection which is included in the
contract to check crawl space.

Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.
To approve:
Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.
Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and
wider. Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would
need to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by
Scott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.

I mentioned that it was hard to understand. Just giving me the totals I owe is still not great. Can you enumerate line items in such a way that I can

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the next
bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment

Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70

The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

They don’t allow gs anymotee, just golf place. I’ll see what we have left and ones left are restricted, so very limited use.

How should we handle them? I am open to suggestions. If we booked them in prime weeks, we could do what you did last time or swap with
friends. But I'm not sure what else we would really use them for. Either way, they are worth a material amount. Let me know your thoughts.

I have all the stock sales (I’ll share in email).
It’s the cost basis that I need to figure out.
Are you open to the payment a day later?

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.

<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000
Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000

Difference in amount taxed at 37%: $300,000
Tax Savings: $300,000 × (37% - 35%) = $6,000 direct savings
Plus tax deferral benefit on full $300,000 payment

Notes below. Thanks for the heads up.
Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can

I am.
Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account . That
will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from those
gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer but that was
speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was the trade off that we
speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.
