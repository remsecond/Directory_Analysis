Notes below. Thanks for the heads up.
Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can
help you.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

I saw I got 9836 transferred into my fidelity account. Was it supposed to be 9986, if we split 19972? I think it was less because of your hair debit card
purchase of 299.
I also saw there was a dividend from msft come into the fidelity msft account.
Can you split the dividend of 2892 52% 48%? and transfer to my account so I would receive 1,503.
Thank you!

I would rather him start a bit later in the day and still make it than force an early start to make this time here. And go straight into a session. Just

I’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again. Kari and Alan, and of course AD

That puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the
“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.

Can we sync on AD plans given he feels crummy?
I would rather him start a bit later in the day and still make it than force an early start to make this time here. And go straight into a session. Just
hearing that already sounds draining to me.

But if we shift it might work better and we can all couch camp. It’s and idea because I don’t want a big backlog of makeups which could
otherwise be Thurs, tomorrow, maybe Whistler Sat... ?

Super frustrating not to be able to get answers to easy q’s. It’s a 30 second call but I wait hours. You know I’m going to respond because I have
milliseconds at best, but you do this anyway.
I finally got us on a call today and overcame weeks of bickering and crossed wires. It got the exact outcome you asked for, most in real time. So I

I’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again. Kari and Alan, and of course

That puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the

Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.

Message 151 of 287
I asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just
continue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion that
would take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that don’t have
the info required to make the determination.
Yesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You refused to
answer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on you to check in
and when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.
I’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with you,
Christine.
If you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help you both
out.

Question for what? Alan asked if he could drop off early and I said yes.
If you are asking about your sarcastic comments... they are abusive.

I was in my therapy session. I saw Alan’s text.

Thank you

Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.
Is this what was decided last week?

I’ll just wait to see if I hear from you so we can make the best decision for Adrian. I’d prefer not to use him as a middle man for this. That’s
unhealthy.

Any way to coordinate with you in case I want AD to get him some rest before the nutcracker?

I saw his tummy started to hurt. Poor guy. We will see about game tomorrow night.
I’ll work on some calendar system for him at house.

Obviously I sent him home because AD was super worried about going tonight. And with no info on if that’s happening either way, I gave my time
up.

Kari asked in general if Sunday better. You had responded in the affirmative previously this Sat was fine.

Hospital.. you know after you touched my arm I asked you not too, you got upset and followed me. That woman asked if everything was ok. You
started talking about our sex life. If you continue to dispute that, you have not learned anything.
Just like three years sober. That’s a lie
The fact I did not respond in a 15 min timeframe today was no reason to send these messages.
Nutcracker tickets were purchased prior to rescheduling to today. If you plan to weaponize changes in schedule I accommodated against me, that just
sets the stage.
Looking forward to getting the PC on board and hearing from Sound Practices. Did you share my contact information with them already?
