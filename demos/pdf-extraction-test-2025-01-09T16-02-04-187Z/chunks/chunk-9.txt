Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.
Is this what was decided last week?

sent you a pdf of your SBUX Insurance Card.
Can you share an update of any reimbursements you have submitted?
The ones I have gotten back are so far applied towards deductible so no reimbursement.

I never had a say in a single decision for the Seahawks. I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and energy
to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away tickets that you
transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and expectations are beyond
astounding.

Christine, I have done everything humanly possible to work with you. If you have a suggestion of something I did not do please bring it up with me.
Our history is replete  with me asking to turn the page, do something new together to work on behalf of the kids, at least for their mental health.
I stressed this again on the 10th. But you were busy with girls night as your priority. Then I followed up last week addressing every concern you had.
Now we have 35 response long OFW thread trying to figure out AD’s time instead of a 30 second phone call. He missed Kari and went home early.
“Let me think about it,” that’s all you have said for over a year. My assumption is that it will go for many more years. Nothing changes with you.
I am always nice in front of AD, I don’t scream or wag my finger “we are at war.” That’s not good for him. I want him to love the part of them that is
you.
How would you like to handle tonight? Do we show him that we put him first? That’s what I would propose. You have seen I do that. Your call.

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or never
saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids future. As a
byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what we will
do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better
parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or
never saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids
future. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what
we will do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.
We moved mountains on Thur. Let’s do it again.

Ok... but please consider what we discussed. We don’t need someone else to tell us. Please let me know. We are adults too, and I am glad she agrees,
but lets take our life back, make decisions on our own in the interests of our kids, and let them help us rather than letting anyone be the puppet
master.
I am only asking:
- Get you in touch with sound practices
- have a pro help us learn how to work together
What is the worst thing that can happen? She says “hey, quit seeking professional help to be better parents?” I think at that point she actually takes
over and drives that engagement. That is her job imho.

Can you check the msft Fidelity account. The dividend was not transferred out.

I thought I already paid you the difference in 52/48? Isn’t that explained in the email?

Can you transfer my 52% of the 2,892 msft dividend paid on Dec 12 that remains in the account. 52% is equal to 1,503.

There is less in the account now as you have some personal expenses deducting from it.
If you are still confirming with Lisa if it is 50/50 split versus a 52/48 split, can you transfer 1,446 now then wait for confirmation.
There was also a deposit of 14.959 shares on Dec 2. My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what
Lisa view on this as this will impact future drops.
Thank you

This is hostile and you are holding my money hostage. Please transfer money you owe to me.
For the 300k payment due end of year, I am agreeing to Jan 5. Thank you.

Sorry, I’m not doing this anymore. It’s too difficult to understand all your fragmented one off messages.
If you would like to have a productive meeting like normal people like I hosted last Thurs let me know.

No I made a mistake and applied the mortgage payment to the wrong loan so I put in more than I should have to condo loan. It applied to
principal balance.

How does that work? Is the extra month elective?

Subject:Extra Mortgage Payment
Given timing of when mortgage payment is due and no response, I’ll make a payment from my funds then subtract this extra amount I paid
towards Condo loan, prior to split of proceeds from the sale of the Condo.
