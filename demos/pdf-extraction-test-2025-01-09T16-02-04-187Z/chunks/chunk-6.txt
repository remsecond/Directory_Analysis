So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?

Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and

Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands
with me.
I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the next
bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)

Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today

BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can
help you.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

can have Lisa compare to our agreement? Even if it is just a screen cap of the excel sheet that I noted that I was struggling with.

Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.
Just let me know if you still have that interpretation.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.

If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.

<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

I am.
Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account . That
will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from those
gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer but that was
speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was the trade off that we
speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

I am.
Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

I have all the stock sales (I’ll share in email).
It’s the cost basis that I need to figure out.
Are you open to the payment a day later?

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis

Base Income:
Christine's Income: $226,000
Documented Stock Sales: $220,698.70
Estimated Gains (70%): $154,489
Current Total: $380,489 + $226,000 = $606,489

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Sales Needed for Me: $200,000
Equalization Payment: $300,000
Final Total: $1,106,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $412,739 at 37%
Additional Tax at 37% vs 35%: $8,255

Total Income Calculation:
Current Total: $606,489
Additional Sales Needed: $200,000

Final Total: $806,489
Tax Bracket Breakdown:
First $693,750 at graduated rates through 35%
Remaining $112,739 at 37%
Reduces amount in highest bracket by $300,000

Difference in amount taxed at 37%: $300,000
Tax Savings: $300,000 × (37% - 35%) = $6,000 direct savings
Plus tax deferral benefit on full $300,000 payment

Notes below. Thanks for the heads up.
Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can
help you.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.
Is that correct?
