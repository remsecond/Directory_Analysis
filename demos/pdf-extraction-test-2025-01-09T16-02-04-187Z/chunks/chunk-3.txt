[Section: 2. Documented Impact:]



2023: 66 days of direct father-son time

Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his communications to others, not just me.
I was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into
mediation so there should have been no surprise.
Below is blaming me again.
I’m looking forward to speaking with Sound  Practices. I understand they were supposed to reach out to me, but I have not heard from them to

I am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I
asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.
He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.

So just asking - did you take a vote again?

Subject:What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule

Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

I tried to call for the first time in four months because this is so important to his future.
But there is no way to contact you if you refuse to answer here, on email, by OFW call.

Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.
This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship

- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice

I am asking to talk  tonight before it goes to court. That is why it has to be tonight. If one call in four months (a rate of 3 a year) is too much for
something of this magnitude. Then there will never be anything that meets the bar.
If you don’t let me chat , you see blame, because that is what you are making up. I am not blaming you. I am asking for a peaceful and constructive
discussion. May we please take a minute to even check if
It’s worth a longer conversation.

Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.
This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

You had it. You choose not to use it. I have all versions. No free will for Adrian, total and complete free will for Max was not in his plan. You
took Adrian’s agency away through adulthood. You can’t change what you did and will need to live with that.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:

Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):

- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice

2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time

- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood

- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

I am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I
asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.
He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.
So just asking - did you take a vote again?

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:

Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
-No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
-Brother has full freedom
-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

If you don’t let me chat , you see blame, because that is what you are making up. I am not blaming you. I am asking for a peaceful and

I hope you will please consider equality over inequity.
