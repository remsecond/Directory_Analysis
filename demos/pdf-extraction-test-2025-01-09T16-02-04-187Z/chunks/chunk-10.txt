I made an error and the mortgage payment I submitted went towards the Condo loan.
Are you OK if I use one month and a portion of the second month of the rental income to cover my mortgage payment?

For the 300k payment due end of year, I am agreeing to Jan 5. Thank you.

No I made a mistake and applied the mortgage payment to the wrong loan so I put in more than I should have to condo loan. It applied to
principal balance.

Given timing of when mortgage payment is due and no response, I’ll make a payment from my funds then subtract this extra amount I paid
towards Condo loan, prior to split of proceeds from the sale of the Condo.

Your inattention to details and non stop harassment is scary. You know how much time I spend typing the words “you did not Answear the
question” or “can you please reread the email” it’s honestly nuts.
On AD- That’s a lame excuse for needing a 30 reply long thread instead of a 30 sec phone call. The fact that you sit here and try to make it sound
sensible is beyond me. It demonstrates what I deal with.
Quit harassing me.

I know it was not paid out. But I made up the difference in the split with a cash payment. So from there on it should be 50-50. I’m actually
really tired of this Christine when I can’t get a 30 sec phone call to coordinate for my kid and he has to lose 2 1/2 hours with me. This all seems
nuts to me and your attention to detail across platforms is not where it needs to be.

Can you transfer my 52% of the 2,892 msft dividend paid on Dec 12 that remains in the account. 52% is equal to 1,503.
There is less in the account now as you have some personal expenses deducting from it.
If you are still confirming with Lisa if it is 50/50 split versus a 52/48 split, can you transfer 1,446 now then wait for confirmation.
There was also a deposit of 14.959 shares on Dec 2. My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what
Lisa view on this as this will impact future drops.
Thank you

You have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we could
keep our running list format.
Now issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list
meeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.
I want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest
something better than what we know works.
Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to push
back on something that clearly does not.
Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need the
help you have refused for over a year now.
I don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for
something different. I want “>31” instead.

Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m not
doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for the wrong
things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.
The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when you
said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a mistake, agreeing
to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.
If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim example. And
him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?
So I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”

It's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you just let

It's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you
just let me, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.) You seemed like you would consider it. We talked about therapy, and you said
you would ask your therapist. But now I see this demand. That is what gaslighting is.

well that is that

Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m
not doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for
the wrong things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.
The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when
you said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a
mistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch.... I can go on.
If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim
example. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?
So I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”

The running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.
Saying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context of what was happening.
The DV was real and confirmed.

You have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we
could keep our running list format.
Now issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list
meeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.
I want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest
something better than what we know works.
Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to
push back on something that clearly does not.
Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need

the help you have refused for over a year now.
I don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for
something different. I want “>31” instead.
Please stop the crazy. Let’s work together.

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough to
send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were screen
captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we should
perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via the
Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final decision
based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't expect
that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely disqualifies him
for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind sharing the
plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I can also
