I think I’m happy with the legwork you did with Jeff.
Want to just bait till the same list window for the house? We can decide then if we like?

Subject:Condo Sale
Questions:
Is Jan 15th listing a hard list date or open to list Spring (Feb/March/April) based on Jeff recommendation.
Home/Condo Sale agreement - Suggest add language "List by Jan 15th, or based on list date recommended by agent"
Jeff Conversation Summary

Has not seen big change or reduction in rates post election.
Current listings in Kirkland after election, has not seen much activity.
Does not anticipate much movement in activity or rates between now and end of year.
But could move if priced right.
List by date Jan 15 - could sit for a few months if beginning of year.
Activity picks up mid Feb/March - there is stigma if sits too long.
Recommend wait to list Feb/March/April
Tenant - What options do we want to give him?
He is on month to month, would need to give him a 30 day notice.
Jeff offered to approach the tenant to discuss options and what he wants. Should time discussion appropriately so tenant does not move too
early if wants to leave.
Stay until it sells?
Don't expect too many people
Online appointment/need to coordinate
Stay and perhaps investor? (Mature man/stable job)
Vacate?
99% of listings for sale, are offering to pay the buyers commission 2.5% to 3%.
Buyers' agent - need to have buyers' agreement - this could include buyer pays them 3%.
Buyers agent may insist on difference and could be negotiating point for seller to pay the difference, or buyer will pay.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Message 4 of 287
That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands with me.
I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads. Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what he
does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.

Message 5 of 287
So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?
Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

Message 14 of 287
Safeco called me back and I spoke to Alex.

My take away.
As you are not at the Kirkland residence, you would need to call and request separate policy for your car at existing residence. I can’t do it as I am still
in the Kirkland residence.
I would remain on existing policy, but my rate would adjust after you drop off.
We would then need to figure split payment of earthquake or I guess we could request that be a separate policy too and figure out payment.
Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple

All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution

It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.

I’m ok doing that for now assuming there is no dispute about amounts or it just gets messy staying in this state.
I left message for Alex to have autopayment pull from jt account on Dec 10.
See Safeco tab in the shared workbook which breaks it down. Yours is 532, mine is 225. We should both deposit that in the joint account.
You had requested the SafeCo breakdown in an email sent by your lawyers during the last mediation.
Can you confirm no further questions or issues on this. If you are good, I’ll transfer my share into BofA.

Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple
occasions.
All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution
now is to formally split it.

Why would we do this before we are divorced? Are you just intentionally trying to cost us more? I don’t get you. First I offer anyway possible
not to move the boys just for their own good and you won’t let me keep you in the house even when you benefit, you have to make a big deal

out of us being divorce to SAAS because that is in their best interest somehow, and now this. I assume you wanna file separately instead of his

I called SafeCo to understand how to split our car insurance policies.
It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.
Monthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.

Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.
To approve:
Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.
Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and wider.
Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would need to fix if
damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by Scott
(Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We have
discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the language
used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I

Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
-Complete autonomy over relationship with father
-Can choose any amount of time
-Can make decisions based on his feelings
-No restrictions on contact
-No supervision requirements
-No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
-Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
-Can't get back to previous level of contact
-Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
-Can't choose more time like his brother
-Can't request return to previous schedule
-Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes

-He has permanent restrictions
-Different standards for same family
-Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
-Changes relationship with father through childhood
-Can't recover lost time/connection ever
-Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
-Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him, even
well past Max's age:
-Reduce his relationship with his father
-Remove his agency in the relationship
-Create inequality with his brother
-Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about
Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his
relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about
spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he
does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost
something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if my
parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as they were,
they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

Thank you for the update. I did not hear from him.
Next Saturday? He would need to be home by 5:30pm.

Alan called during mediation. He may have talked to you first, but you would have also been in mediation. He can't do Sunday, he is out of
town. Open to suggestions.

So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?
Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

Do you have timing/thoughts for the visit Sunday?
