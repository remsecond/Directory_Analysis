Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

So I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts
for us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!

Hope you are having an awesome time!

It looks like it transferred out of the Jt account and not in.

Transferred to the kid's account so you could grab it whenever you want. Sent deats in email.

Happy to do that. I’m not fighting over the 52 vs 50
Thanks!

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

Cash also works. Sometimes something hand has a different effect.
I’ll ask and get back to you. He’s napping.

Hey- whatever we decide on, this is what we agreed to stop doing if there was a conversation that needed clarity. Can we please do as we agreed
and have a conversation to either agree or agree to disagree? I’m trying to understand the situation and don’t yet.

So I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts
for us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last
week.

I’m not fighting. The comment for new traditions is in reference to change in celebrating separately.

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?

So I put $500 in this AM because it looked overdrawn. I’ll try to see whats up but any forensic records you have would be helpful. I would swear I got
it right but but maybe not. If you share your fidelity and BofA account numbers I can set those up.. but now that I say that I think I have the BofA
already because I transfer the 2.1k .... I’m a little lost. I’ll work on this
