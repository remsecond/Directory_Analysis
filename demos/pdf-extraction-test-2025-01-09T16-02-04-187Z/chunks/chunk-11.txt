Sure. Your saying that his academic choices and whether to peruse advanced placement is none of my concern.

Yes please ask Lisa if this is considered a major decision.
Also waiting for Lisa feedback on interpretation on payment of expenses prior to Oct 31, your medical expenses, the 52/48 split of msft vested
stock post Nov 1, and outstanding transfer of dividend in Msft account.

I thought we were going to discuss decisions before you unilaterally made them for the children.
Should I ask for an interpretation or are you just ignoring our court order again?

Is the partial answer intentional?
You didn’t really answer the question. Especially, if you envision a place for me in his life for academic discussions. I did get him into SAAS so maybe
that’s all you wanted after he got rejected. So let me know.
I hate being shut out my kids lives, but that’s your call.

Ok. Confirming Adrian pick up at 3:45 at bus stop today by Alan.
Math - Adrian and I are reviewing the materials sent by the school over break and I will provide feedback once school starts.

Thanks. I have a very long list of things I have not seen a response on. How do we address that since this is a one way street and you refuse to
accommodate the way we addressed every issue you had at this exact time last week? Instead, you got all your answers and then said “I’m not
doing that.”
Adrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.
And given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on
that! I see him in less than two hours. It is always this way with you.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via
the Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final
decision based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't
expect that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely
disqualifies him for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind
sharing the plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I
can also help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.

Let's make those Stanford trips worth something.

Message 211 of 287
Just connected with Alan. He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How
should I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?
I think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally
deciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.
Were you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really can’t
think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.

I don't know how tonight happened, but if Dec 10th was the biggest night of our lives, I want to make Dec 19th just as significant. Maybe those same
planets aligned for us one more time.
So please accept my sincerest apologies for my response to this original email, which surprised me. That is not an excuse- my response was
inappropriate and uncalled for.  As mentioned, if the original email was sent from me, it was not intentional. I hope you will forgive me for that and
my uncalled-for escalation. We have enough history and scar tissue to last a lifetime. I will do my best to cooperate with you and seek to de-escalate
rather than inflame moving forward.

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough
to send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were
screen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we
should perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.
Of course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.

Just connected with Alan. He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How
should I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?
I think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally
deciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.
Were you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really
can’t think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.

You didn’t really answer the question. Especially, if you envision a place for me in his life for academic discussions. I did get him into SAAS so

maybe that’s all you wanted after he got rejected. So let me know.
I hate being shut out my kids lives, but that’s your call.

Thanks. I have a very long list of things I have not seen a response on. How do we address that since this is a one way street and you refuse to
accommodate the way we addressed every issue you had at this exact time last week? Instead, you got all your answers and then said “I’m not
doing that.”
Adrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.
And given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on
that! I see him in less than two hours. It is always this way with you.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via
the Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final
decision based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't
expect that formality, but I'd like to confer.

Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely
disqualifies him for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind
sharing the plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I
can also help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.
Let's make those Stanford trips worth something.
thanks in advance on the partnership to be the best parents we can for these guys!

I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a sleepover.
This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.

have a conversation to either agree or agree to disagree? I’m trying to understand the situation and don’t yet.

So I’m not sure i understand. Of course we celebrate separately. We were asked to do that last year because Debbie. And I did all the Santa gifts
for us and gave you the credit. If we are still doing that and it’s your turn that’s great. What am I missing? I’d prefer we talk like we agreed to last
week.

I’m not fighting. The comment for new traditions is in reference to change in celebrating separately.

Uh... ok/ Were you going to tell me about the new traditions? I did ask ahead of time and gave you the opportunity to tell me a couple weeks
back.

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
