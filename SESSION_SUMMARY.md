# Session Summary - 2024-01-14

## What Happened Today

1. Started with a simple goal:
   - Move files from input folder to output folder
   - Sort by file type
   - Run with a simple bat file

2. Got sidetracked with:
   - Complex architecture designs
   - Multiple servers and processors
   - Extensive documentation (50+ files)
   - Feature creep (Google integration, LLM processing)
   - Version control systems
   - Complex duplicate handling

3. Result:
   - Basic file moving never worked properly
   - Codebase became unnecessarily complex
   - Lost focus on core functionality

## Next Session Plan

We will start fresh with a simple approach:

1. Basic Structure:
   ```
   input/     # Drop files here
   output/    # Files get sorted here
   organize.bat
   organize.py
   ```

2. Basic Functionality:
   - Drop files in input folder
   - Click organize.bat
   - Files move to correct output folders

No complex architecture, no extensive documentation, no extra features. Just files moving from input to output folders.

## Key Takeaway

Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. We'll build the basic functionality first, then consider adding features only after the core system works perfectly.
