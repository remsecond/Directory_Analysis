# PDF Processing Pipeline Checkpoint - January 9, 2025

## Latest Achievement: Base Document Structure

We've established a validated base document structure that serves as the foundation for all document processing:

### Core Data Structure
```json
{
  "thread_id": "string",
  "timeline": {
    "events": [{
      "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
      "type": "message|document|event",
      "content": "string",
      "participants": ["string"],
      "topics": ["string"],
      "sentiment": -1.0 to 1.0
    }]
  },
  "relationships": {
    "participant_network": {
      "participant1": {
        "participant2": "relationship_type"
      }
    },
    "topic_links": {
      "topic1": {
        "topic2": "relationship_type"
      }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source_file": "string",
    "validation_status": "pending|valid|invalid",
    "processing_timestamp": "ISO-8601"
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. Required Fields:
   - thread_id
   - timeline.events
   - relationships.participant_network
   - relationships.topic_links
   - All metadata fields

2. Data Types:
   - Timestamps must be valid ISO-8601 format
   - Event types must be one of: message, document, event
   - Sentiment scores must be between -1 and 1
   - Arrays (participants, topics) must contain strings

3. Relationship Structure:
   - Participant relationships are bidirectional
   - Topic relationships support hierarchical organization

### Base Processor Features
1. Document Creation:
   - Generates unique thread IDs
   - Initializes empty timeline and relationship structures
   - Sets initial metadata with pending status

2. Event Management:
   - Adds timeline events with automatic timestamps
   - Validates event structure and content
   - Maintains chronological order

3. Relationship Mapping:
   - Tracks participant interactions
   - Maps topic relationships
   - Supports relationship type classification

4. Validation:
   - Schema validation using Ajv
   - Format validation for dates and enums
   - Error reporting with detailed messages

## Previously Working Features

1. PDF Processing Pipeline
- Handles large PDFs (tested up to 1,048 pages, ~515K tokens)
- Smart chunking with configurable size limits (currently 25K tokens)
- Preserves document structure and section boundaries
- Maintains metadata and context

2. Output Organization
- Structured output in ai-outputs/[model]/
- Separate directories for each model (claude, deepseek, gpt4, notebooklm, sonnet)
- Timestamped processing runs
- Complete extraction with metadata

3. File Outputs
- Chunked JSON files with metadata
- Full extracted text
- Processing reports
- Success logs

## Tested Files
1. OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf
   - 358 pages
   - ~180K tokens
   - 14 balanced chunks

2. Emails w_ Jennifer after Sept 1.pdf
   - 125 pages
   - ~82K tokens
   - 6 balanced chunks

3. All OFW Messages.pdf
   - 1,048 pages
   - ~515K tokens
   - 40 balanced chunks

## Key Components
1. src/schemas/base-schema.js
   - Core data structure definition
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - Schema versioning

2. src/services/base-processor.js
   - Base document processing logic
   - Event and relationship management
   - Validation handling

3. scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js
   - Main pipeline script
   - Handles PDF processing
   - Creates model-specific output directories
   - Generates structured output files

4. src/services/pdf-processor.js
   - Core PDF processing logic
   - Smart chunking algorithm
   - Structure preservation
   - Metadata extraction

## Usage
```bash
# Process a PDF file
node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js "path/to/your.pdf"

# Run base processor tests
node test-base-processor.js
```

## Next Steps
1. Update PDF processor to use new base structure
2. Implement model-specific processors extending base
3. Add validation rules for specific document types
4. Enhance relationship mapping capabilities
5. Add progress tracking for large files
6. Optimize memory usage for larger documents

This represents our latest architectural foundation:
- From: Model-centric output organization
- To: Data-centric structure with model-specific enhancements
- Result: A validated, consistent base for all document processing
