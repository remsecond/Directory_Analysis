# EvidenceAI Debug Context

## Current Situation
We are working on processing OFW (Office for Windows) Message Reports in PDF format. The main PDF file we're working with is `OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf` located in the evidenceai/test-data directory.

## Problems Encountered

1. **Script Execution Issues**
   - Multiple scripts (pdf-check.js, process-ofw-simple.js, test-file.js, desktop-test.js, debug.js) have been created to process the PDF
   - None of the scripts appear to be producing visible output or creating files
   - We can't verify if the scripts are executing properly due to lack of console output
   - File system operations (reading PDF, creating directories, writing files) appear to be failing silently

2. **System Issues**
   - Clipboard functionality has stopped working
   - Console/terminal output is not visible
   - File system operations seem to be blocked or failing

3. **File Access**
   - We can see the PDF file exists in test-data directory
   - We've been unable to successfully:
     * Create the pdf-check output directory
     * Write test files
     * Generate log files
     * Save processing results

## Scripts Created

1. **pdf-check.js**
   - Main script for PDF processing using pdf2json
   - Attempts to extract and save PDF information

2. **process-ofw-simple.js**
   - Simplified version focusing on basic PDF operations
   - Attempts to read and analyze PDF content

3. **test-file.js**
   - Basic file system operations test
   - Attempts to verify file access and writing capabilities

4. **desktop-test.js**
   - Attempts to write directly to Desktop
   - Includes detailed logging to pdf-test.log

5. **debug.js**
   - Most comprehensive debugging script
   - Includes environment info, file system tests, and detailed error reporting
   - Uses console.error for output
   - Implements uncaught exception handling

## Next Steps After Reboot

1. **System Check**
   - Verify clipboard functionality is restored
   - Ensure terminal/console output is working
   - Check for any system error messages or logs

2. **Script Testing**
   - Run debug.js script to get detailed system information
   - Command to run: `cd C:\Users\robmo\Desktop\evidenceai && node scripts/debug.js`
   - Verify console output is visible
   - Check if file system operations are working

3. **File System Verification**
   - Verify access to test-data directory
   - Test basic file creation and writing
   - Check directory creation permissions

4. **PDF Processing**
   - Once basic operations are working, return to PDF processing
   - Verify pdf2json installation and functionality
   - Test PDF reading and content extraction

## Additional Considerations

1. **Security Software**
   - Check if any security software is blocking file operations
   - Verify Node.js has necessary permissions

2. **Node.js Environment**
   - Verify Node.js installation and version
   - Check for any module loading issues
   - Ensure proper ES modules vs CommonJS usage

3. **Project Configuration**
   - Review package.json settings
   - Verify dependencies are properly installed
   - Check for any conflicting configurations

This context will help us resume debugging efficiently after the system reboot. The immediate focus will be on verifying basic system functionality (clipboard, console output, file system access) before proceeding with PDF processing tasks.
