# Quick Start Reading Guide

While your development environment is being set up, here's a curated reading path through our documentation to understand our architecture, processes, and future direction.

## 1. Current State & Direction (30 mins)
- ðŸ“˜ `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
  * Understand what worked and what didn't
  * See why we're moving to a cleaner architecture
  * Learn from our past decisions

- ðŸ“— `docs/PRESERVED_LEARNINGS.md`
  * Technical insights we're keeping
  * Code patterns that work
  * Performance considerations

## 2. New Architecture (30 mins)
- ðŸ“• `docs/REBUILD_STRATEGY.md`
  * Clean architecture approach
  * Phase-by-phase rebuild plan
  * Integration strategy

- ðŸ“™ `docs/REBUILD_STARTING_POINT.md`
  * Initial implementation examples
  * Project structure
  * Core components

## 3. Innovation Management (30 mins)
- ðŸ“” `docs/INNOVATION_MANAGEMENT.md`
  * How we handle new features
  * Experimental project structure
  * Integration process

- ðŸ““ `docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md`
  * Project setup
  * Development guidelines
  * PR process

## 4. Progress Tracking (15 mins)
- ðŸ“’ `docs/PROGRESS_TRACKING.md`
  * How we measure progress
  * Core stability metrics
  * Innovation health checks

## Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Core vs. Experimental
- Core functionality is stable and critical
- Experimental features are isolated
- Clear integration path through feature flags

### 2. MCP Servers
- When to use them
- How to create them
- Integration patterns

### 3. Processing Pipeline
- Document routing
- Processing stages
- Error handling

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing
- Performance testing

## Next Steps

After environment setup:
1. Run core pipeline locally
2. Review test coverage
3. Try creating experimental project
4. Understand CI/CD process

Remember:
- Core stability is priority
- Experimental features are isolated
- Clear documentation is crucial
- Test coverage is essential

This reading path will give you a solid understanding of our architecture and processes while your development environment is being prepared.
