# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions
1. Create basic file processor
   - Input: Use folder path from config.json
   - Output: Basic file inventory and categorization
   - No complex processing initially

2. Implement core functionality
   - Read files from selected directory
   - Basic file type detection
   - Simple file organization structure

3. Test with minimal configuration
   - Focus on file system operations
   - Skip complex processing features initially
   - Validate basic file handling

## Technical Improvements
1. Simplify processor architecture
   - Consolidate multiple processor implementations
   - Create unified processing pipeline
   - Remove dependency on Python virtual environment

2. Improve error handling
   - Better setup script validation
   - Clear error messages for configuration issues
   - Graceful handling of missing dependencies

3. Documentation updates
   - Document successful folder selection implementation
   - Clear steps for pipeline integration
   - Updated architecture diagrams

## Future Enhancements
1. Add advanced processing features
   - PDF content extraction
   - Email parsing
   - Metadata analysis

2. Improve user interface
   - Progress indicators
   - Processing status updates
   - Error reporting

3. Integration capabilities
   - Google Drive support
   - Cloud storage options
   - External API connections
