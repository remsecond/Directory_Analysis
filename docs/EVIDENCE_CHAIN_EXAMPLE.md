# Evidence Chain Example: Travel Authorization Case

Using real test data from `C:/Users/robmo/OneDrive/Documents/evidenceai_test/input/3_File_Nov_Jan_Test`, here's how the Evidence Chain Architecture processes a complete verification scenario.

## Sample Evidence Chain

```typescript
const travelAuthorizationChain: EvidenceChain = {
  claim: {
    id: "claim-travel-auth-2024-12",
    text: "I submitted the travel authorization form for Adrian",
    source: "Email exchange with christinemoyer_hotmail.com after 2024-10-31 before 2025-01-12.pdf",
    timestamp: "2024-12-26T10:15:00Z",
    context: "Email thread discussing travel authorization requirements"
  },
  
  evidence: {
    primary: {
      id: "doc-adrian-auth-2024-12",
      type: "application/pdf",
      hash: "sha256:...",
      timestamp: "2024-11-20T08:30:00Z",
      location: "Attachments/Adrian Yukon Auth 11_20_24.pdf",
      content_type: "application/pdf",
      extracted_text: "Travel Authorization Form..."
    },
    
    supporting: [
      {
        id: "doc-consent-form",
        type: "application/pdf",
        relationship: "validates",
        timestamp: "2024-12-24T14:20:00Z",
        confidence: 0.95,
        location: "Attachments/Consent for Minor Travel _Canada December 2024 Moyer_.pdf"
      },
      {
        id: "doc-consent-docusign",
        type: "application/pdf",
        relationship: "validates",
        timestamp: "2024-12-24T15:45:00Z",
        confidence: 0.98,
        location: "Attachments/Complete_with_Docusign_Consent_for_Minor_Tra_1_.pdf"
      },
      {
        id: "doc-health-form",
        type: "application/pdf",
        relationship: "supports",
        timestamp: "2024-12-20T11:30:00Z",
        confidence: 0.9,
        location: "Attachments/Travel Health Form.pdf"
      }
    ],
    
    timeline: {
      before: [
        {
          id: "event-initial-request",
          type: "email",
          timestamp: "2024-11-15T09:00:00Z",
          relevance: 0.8
        },
        {
          id: "event-form-submission",
          type: "form_submission",
          timestamp: "2024-11-20T08:30:00Z",
          relevance: 1.0
        }
      ],
      after: [
        {
          id: "event-confirmation",
          type: "email",
          timestamp: "2024-12-26T10:30:00Z",
          relevance: 0.9
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  
  verification: {
    status: "verified",
    confidence: 0.95,
    methods: [
      "document_verification",
      "signature_verification",
      "timeline_consistency",
      "cross_reference_validation"
    ],
    gaps: [],
    notes: [
      "All required forms present and properly signed",
      "Timeline shows consistent progression",
      "Multiple supporting documents verify the claim",
      "DocuSign verification confirms authenticity"
    ]
  }
};
```

## Processing Steps

1. **Document Ingestion**
   ```typescript
   // Process email PDF
   const emailThread = await documentProcessor.process({
     path: "Email exchange with christinemoyer_hotmail.com after 2024-10-31 before 2025-01-12.pdf",
     type: "email_thread"
   });
   
   // Extract claims
   const claims = await documentProcessor.extractClaims(emailThread);
   // Found: "I submitted the travel authorization form for Adrian"
   ```

2. **Evidence Collection**
   ```typescript
   // Process primary evidence
   const authForm = await evidenceProcessor.processAttachment({
     path: "Attachments/Adrian Yukon Auth 11_20_24.pdf",
     type: "travel_authorization"
   });
   
   // Process supporting documents
   const supportingDocs = await Promise.all([
     evidenceProcessor.processAttachment({
       path: "Attachments/Consent for Minor Travel _Canada December 2024 Moyer_.pdf",
       type: "consent_form"
     }),
     evidenceProcessor.processAttachment({
       path: "Attachments/Complete_with_Docusign_Consent_for_Minor_Tra_1_.pdf",
       type: "signed_consent"
     }),
     evidenceProcessor.processAttachment({
       path: "Attachments/Travel Health Form.pdf",
       type: "health_form"
     })
   ]);
   ```

3. **Timeline Construction**
   ```typescript
   const timeline = await timelineBuilder.buildFromEvents([
     {
       type: "email",
       content: "Initial request for travel authorization",
       timestamp: "2024-11-15T09:00:00Z"
     },
     {
       type: "form_submission",
       content: "Travel authorization form submitted",
       timestamp: "2024-11-20T08:30:00Z",
       attachments: ["Adrian Yukon Auth 11_20_24.pdf"]
     },
     {
       type: "form_submission",
       content: "Health form submitted",
       timestamp: "2024-12-20T11:30:00Z",
       attachments: ["Travel Health Form.pdf"]
     },
     {
       type: "form_submission",
       content: "Consent forms submitted",
       timestamp: "2024-12-24T14:20:00Z",
       attachments: [
         "Consent for Minor Travel _Canada December 2024 Moyer_.pdf",
         "Complete_with_Docusign_Consent_for_Minor_Tra_1_.pdf"
       ]
     },
     {
       type: "email",
       content: "Confirmation of submission",
       timestamp: "2024-12-26T10:30:00Z"
     }
   ]);
   ```

4. **Evidence Chain Construction**
   ```typescript
   // Create chain
   const chain = await chainBuilder.createChain({
     claim: "I submitted the travel authorization form for Adrian",
     source: emailThread,
     primaryEvidence: authForm
   });
   
   // Add supporting evidence
   await Promise.all(supportingDocs.map(doc => 
     chainBuilder.addEvidence(chain, doc)
   ));
   
   // Add timeline
   await chainBuilder.addTimeline(chain, timeline);
   
   // Validate chain
   const validation = await chainBuilder.validateChain(chain);
   // Result: Valid chain with high confidence (0.95)
   ```

## Analysis Results

1. **Pattern Detection**
   ```typescript
   const patterns = await patternAnalyzer.findBehavioralPatterns([chain]);
   // Found:
   // - Proper document submission sequence
   // - Complete supporting documentation
   // - Timely follow-up and confirmation
   ```

2. **Timeline Analysis**
   ```typescript
   const timelineAnalysis = await timelineAnalyzer.analyzeSequence(chain.timeline);
   // Results:
   // - Consistent progression of events
   // - No temporal anomalies
   // - All required steps completed in order
   ```

3. **LLM Presentation**
   ```typescript
   const summary = await evidencePresenter.summarizeEvidence(chain);
   // Output:
   // "Travel authorization for Adrian was properly submitted on November 20, 2024,
   // with all required supporting documentation (health form, consent forms)
   // provided by December 24, 2024. The process was completed with final
   // confirmation on December 26, 2024. All documents are verified authentic
   // with DocuSign validation of consent forms."
   ```

## Key Insights
