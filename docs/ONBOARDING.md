# Welcome to EvidenceAI Development

Hi Mira,

Welcome to the EvidenceAI project! This guide will help you understand our documentation structure and get started effectively.

## Essential Documents

### 1. Core Understanding
- [HANDOFF_TO_MIRA.md](HANDOFF_TO_MIRA.md)
  - Start here
  - Core concepts
  - Key principles
  - Lessons learned

### 2. Technical Context
- [HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md](HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md)
  - Pipeline details
  - Real examples
  - Success metrics
  - Implementation guidance

### 3. Future Vision
- [TAGSPACE_VISION.md](TAGSPACE_VISION.md)
  - Future possibilities
  - Architectural guidance
  - Innovation preservation
  - Development path

## Getting Started

### 1. Verify Working Pipeline
```bash
# Test the core pipeline
node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js test-data/OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf

# Verify Google Sheets integration
node scripts/test-sheets-integration.js
```

### 2. Understand Key Files
```javascript
// Core processing pipeline
import { processOFWNow } from './scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js';

// Google Sheets integration
import googleSheets from './src/services/google-sheets.js';

// MCP capabilities
import { PDFProcessorServer } from './src/mcp/pdf-processor-server/index.ts';
```

### 3. Review Architecture
- [ENHANCED_PDF_PIPELINE.md](architecture/ENHANCED_PDF_PIPELINE.md)
  - Multi-tool extraction
  - Smart orchestration
  - Result combination
  - Error handling

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start with Core Pipeline
- Use process-ofw-with-pdf.js
- Verify outputs
- Check Google Sheets
- Test performance

### 2. Mission Control Development
- Focus on user interface
- Keep pipeline stable
- Add monitoring
- Enable visualization

### 3. Documentation
- Update as you go
- Capture decisions
- Note improvements
- Share insights

## Key Principles in Practice

### 1. "Working Code is Sacred"
```javascript
// This works - build on it
const workingPipeline = {
    script: "process-ofw-with-pdf.js",
    integration: "google-sheets.js",
    capabilities: "pdf-processor-server"
};
```

### 2. "Complexity is Earned"
```javascript
// Start simple, add complexity when needed
const development = {
    phase1: "Core functionality",
    phase2: "User interface",
    phase3: "Advanced features"
};
```

### 3. "MVP First, Vision Second"
```javascript
// Focus on what matters now
const priorities = {
    now: "Mission Control interface",
    later: "TagSpace capabilities",
    always: "Document everything"
};
```

## Common Questions

### 1. "Where do I start?"
Start by running and understanding the core pipeline:
```bash
node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js test-data/OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf
```

### 2. "What should I work on?"
Focus on Mission Control:
- File upload interface
- Processing status display
- Output organization
- Document tracking

### 3. "How do I add features?"
- Start with user needs
- Keep pipeline stable
- Document changes
- Test thoroughly

### 4. "What about new ideas?"
- Document them
- Separate from MVP
- Consider architecture
- Plan for future

## Success Path

1. Understand Current State
   - Run working pipeline
   - Review documentation
   - Test integrations
   - Note performance

2. Plan Interface
   - User requirements
   - Core functionality
   - Simple design
   - Clear workflow

3. Implement Carefully
   - Keep pipeline stable
   - Add features gradually
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document changes

4. Share Progress
   - Update documentation
   - Note improvements
   - Share insights
   - Ask questions

## Remember

1. The pipeline works - trust it
2. Mission Control serves users
3. Documentation is crucial
4. Vision guides, doesn't drive

Welcome aboard! We're excited to see how you enhance Mission Control while maintaining our stable foundation.

## Quick Reference

### Working Commands
```bash
# Test pipeline
node scripts/process-ofw-with-pdf.js test-data/OFW_Messages_Report_Dec.pdf

# Check Google Sheets
node scripts/test-sheets-integration.js

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Key Metrics
```javascript
const expectations = {
    processing_time: "~1.3 seconds",
    chunks: "~470 per document",
    success_rate: "100% required"
};
```

### Documentation Updates
```bash
# Core docs
