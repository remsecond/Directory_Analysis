## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. UniversalProcessor
   - Orchestrates multi-source processing
   - Manages source integration
   - Handles timeline generation
   - Validates cross-source relationships

2. Extractors
   - AttachmentProcessor: Handles various file types
   - EmailExtractor: Processes email threads
   - ODSExtractor: Handles structured data
   - PDFExtractor: Processes PDF and text files

3. Validators
   - TemporalValidator: Ensures timestamp consistency
   - ContentValidator: Validates data integrity
   - ReferenceValidator: Verifies relationships

### Data Flow

1. Source Processing
   ```
   Input Sources → Format Detection → Content Extraction → Metadata Generation
   ```

2. Integration Pipeline
   ```
   Multiple Sources → Unified Timeline → Relationship Detection → Validation
   ```

3. Output Generation
   ```
   Validated Data → Timeline Analysis → Confidence Scoring → Final Output
   ```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Format Detection
```javascript
// Content-based format detection
if (firstLine.includes(',') && !firstLine.includes('{')) {
  // Process as CSV
} else {
  try {
    JSON.parse(content);
    // Process as JSON
  } catch {
    // Fallback to CSV processing
  }
}
```

### 2. Timestamp Handling
```javascript
// Timezone-aware timestamp parsing
const timestamp = new Date(dateString);
if (timezone) {
  // Apply timezone offset
  timestamp.setMinutes(timestamp.getMinutes() + timezone.offset);
}
```

### 3. Validation System
```javascript
// Multi-level validation
const validation = {
  temporal: await temporalValidator.validate(data),
  content: await contentValidator.validate(data),
  references: await referenceValidator.validate(data)
};
```
