# Welcome to EvidenceAI!

While your development environment is being set up (which typically takes about 2 hours), we've prepared a curated reading path to help you understand our architecture, processes, and direction.

## First Steps (2 Hours)

1. Start with `docs/QUICK_START_READING.md`
   - This guide provides a structured path through our documentation
   - Each section has estimated reading times
   - Focus on understanding the big picture first

2. Key Areas to Focus On:
   - How we separate core and experimental features
   - When to use MCP servers vs. direct integration
   - Our approach to testing and documentation
   - How we manage innovation safely

## What Makes Us Different

We've learned some important lessons:
- Core stability is critical
- Innovation needs safe spaces
- Documentation is crucial
- Testing is non-negotiable

We've built a system that:
- Keeps core features stable
- Enables safe experimentation
- Preserves knowledge
- Maintains quality

## Your First Day

Morning:
1. Read through documentation (2 hours)
2. Environment setup (2 hours)
3. Team introductions

Afternoon:
1. Run core pipeline locally
2. Review test coverage
3. Create sample experimental project

## What to Expect

- Clean, documented code
- Clear processes
- Strong testing
- Safe innovation

We're excited to have you join us in building something great, the right way.

Welcome aboard!
