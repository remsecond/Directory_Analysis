# Package Analysis Implementation Steps

## Step 1: Package Type Detection
### Why First
- Must know what we're dealing with immediately
- Determines entire processing pipeline
- Affects resource allocation

```javascript
class PackageAnalyzer {
  async analyzeUpload(files) {
    const types = {
      emailPdfOnly: false,
      hasRecordTable: false,
      hasOtherDocs: false
    };
    
    // Analyze uploaded files
    return {
      type: 'PDF_WITH_RECORDS',
      files: {
        emails: [...pdfEmails],
        records: recordTable,
        others: [...otherDocs]
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Step 2: File Relationship Mapping
### Why Second
- Builds on package type detection
- Establishes connections between files
- Critical for validation

```javascript
class FileRelationshipMapper {
  async mapRelationships(files) {
    // Map PDF emails to record entries
    // Group related documents
    return {
      relationships: [
        {
          email: 'email1.pdf',
          record: 'row_1',
          related: ['attachment1.pdf']
        }
        // ...
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Content Validation Strategy
### Why Third
- Uses established relationships
- Different validation per package type
- Optimizes processing path

```javascript
class ContentValidator {
  async determineStrategy(packageType, relationships) {
    switch(packageType) {
      case 'PDF_ONLY':
        return new EmailOnlyValidator();
      case 'PDF_WITH_RECORDS':
        return new EmailRecordValidator();
      case 'PDF_WITH_OTHERS':
        return new MixedContentValidator();
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Differences from Original Plan

1. Files First
- Treat each file as a distinct entity
- Build relationships after identification
- Allow for flexible package structures

2. Package-Level Analysis
- Start with whole package view
- Determine overall structure first
- Then drill down to relationships

3. Dynamic Validation
- Strategy based on package type
- Different rules for different combinations
- Optimized processing paths

This approach better handles the reality of client uploads where files are first-class citizens and package structure determines processing strategy.
