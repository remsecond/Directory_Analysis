# Document-Centric Architecture Context

## Core Concept
Moving from email-centric to document-centric processing means:
1. Documents are first-class citizens
2. Each file has its own identity and lifecycle
3. Relationships between documents are explicit
4. Context is preserved across formats

## Current Implementation Context
Our package analyzer is the first step in this transition:

### What We Have
- Basic file type detection
- Format-specific processing (PDF, ODS)
- Simple relationship detection (email-record pairs)
- Initial context preservation

### What We're Building Towards
- Complete document identity management
- Rich relationship mapping
- Full context chains
- Document evolution tracking

## Key Insights for Future Development

### 1. Document Identity
- Every file needs a unique fingerprint
- Content and metadata hashes are separate
- Creation signatures track origin
- Classification determines processing path

### 2. Relationship Types
- Direct companions (PDF + ODS)
- Context providers (email threads)
- Supporting documents (attachments)
- Version relationships (updates)

### 3. Context Preservation
- Metadata must be preserved
- Relationships must be tracked
- Processing history must be logged
- Context chains must be maintained

## Impact on Future Projects

### 1. Google Integration
- Documents will maintain identity across systems
- Relationships will extend to Google ecosystem
- Context will bridge local and cloud storage
- Processing will be location-agnostic

### 2. TagSpaces Integration
- Documents will carry their context
- Tags will reflect relationships
- Metadata will preserve processing history
- Organization will be context-aware

### 3. Pipeline Enhancement
- Each stage preserves document identity
- Processing maintains relationships
- Context flows through pipeline
- Output preserves full history

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Storage
- Document identity needs persistence
- Relationships require graph-like storage
- Context requires searchable storage
- History requires append-only storage

### 2. Processing
- Identity must be immutable
- Relationships must be verifiable
- Context must be recoverable
- History must be traceable

### 3. API Design
- Document-centric endpoints
- Relationship-aware operations
- Context-preserving calls
- History-tracking responses

This context document helps align current work with the broader document-centric vision while providing guidance for future development.
