# Project Context and Future Implications

## CloudHQ Integration Context
1. What We Built
- ODS processor for CloudHQ spreadsheet exports
- Companion format to existing PDF processing
- Field validation and type handling
- Test coverage and documentation

2. Why It Matters
- Shows value of companion formats
- Demonstrates data enrichment potential
- Establishes pattern for format handling
- Provides metadata validation source

## Relationship to Future Work
1. Google Integration
- CloudHQ exports mirror Google's structure
- Similar metadata fields to Google Sheets
- Potential for direct sheet integration
- Authentication patterns transferable

2. MCP Development
- Format processors as MCP tools
- Metadata extraction as resources
- Cross-format validation services
- Standardized output formats

3. Pipeline Enhancement
- Format detection capabilities
- Companion file handling
- Metadata enrichment patterns
- Validation strategies

## Key Patterns to Carry Forward
1. Technical Patterns
- Base processor inheritance
- Field initialization approach
- Validation strategies
- Test structure

2. Architecture Patterns
- Format independence
- Companion awareness
- Metadata enrichment
- Cross-validation

## Strategic Value
1. For EvidenceAI
- Proven companion format handling
- Reliable metadata extraction
- Format validation patterns
- Enrichment opportunities

2. For Future Features
- Google Sheets integration path
- MCP tool architecture
- Pipeline enhancement approach
- Validation framework

This context helps position current work within larger project goals.
