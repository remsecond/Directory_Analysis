Initial commit: Project documentation and architecture setup

- Added core documentation structure outlining architecture decisions
- Established clear separation between core and experimental features
- Documented innovation management strategy with feature flag approach
- Set up progress tracking framework with core stability metrics
- Defined rebuild strategy with phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Preserved key technical learnings and patterns from existing codebase

Key architectural decisions:
- Single, clean implementation over parallel approaches
- MCP servers for truly separate services only
- Streaming approach for large file processing
- Clear service boundaries and error handling
- Comprehensive testing requirements

This commit establishes the foundation for a stable core platform while enabling safe innovation through isolated experimental features.
