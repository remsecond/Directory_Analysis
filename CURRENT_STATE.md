# Current State

## Recent Progress
- Successfully implemented folder selection UI
- Storing selected folder path in config.json in proper JSON format
- Path captured: `C:\Users\robmo\OneDrive\Desktop\EVA CLeanup\Phase II Evidence\Mediation`

## Current Blockers
- Pipeline integration not working with selected folder path
- Python virtual environment setup issues preventing proper execution
- Multiple processor implementations causing complexity

## Next Steps
1. Simplify processing approach
   - Start with basic file operations before complex processing
   - Focus on one processor implementation first
   - Integrate folder path from config.json into processing pipeline

2. Technical Debt
   - Resolve Python virtual environment issues
   - Consolidate processor implementations
   - Improve error handling for setup scripts

## Priority Tasks
1. Create simplified file processor that can handle the selected folder path
2. Implement basic file operations (read, categorize, move)
3. Add more complex processing features incrementally
