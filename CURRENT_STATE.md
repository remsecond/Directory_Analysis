# Current Development State

## Overview
We've successfully implemented and debugged the ChatGPT evidence preparation pipeline, which processes multiple document types and prepares them for analysis in ChatGPT.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processors
- **PDF Processor**: Fully functional with proper error handling and text extraction
- **ODS Processor**: Successfully handling spreadsheet data and metadata extraction
- **Pipeline Integration**: Both processors working together in the preparation pipeline

### 2. File Processing Status
All three input files successfully processed:
- Email PDF (140KB) - Processed with proper text extraction
- ODS Metadata (1.2KB) - Headers and labels extracted
- OFW Messages (794KB) - Large file handled successfully

### 3. Output Generation
- Generated comprehensive README.md with analysis instructions
- Created detailed manifest.json with file metadata
- Structured output directory with numbered files
- All files properly renamed and organized
