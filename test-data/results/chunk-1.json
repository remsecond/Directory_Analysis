Ever.\nBefore this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.\nSomething that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.\nBut taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are\nabout that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.\nIt was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were\n“real kids.”\nThis is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity.

You did that this summer as well\nwhen he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n\nMax (16):\n- Full autonomy over relationship\n- Direct communication with both parents\n- Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n- No supervision requirements\n- No phase requirements\n- Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n- No autonomy until age 18\n- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n- Must follow rigid phase system\n- Maximum contact permanently reduced\n- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this.

Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from those\ngains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer but that was\nspeculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was the trade off that we\nspeculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.\nI agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.\nSent:12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM\nFrom:Christine Moyer\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:58 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo:Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 07:03 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI am.\nOur agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.\nI’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt\nfidelity.\nYou will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.\nWashington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.\nThat might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.\nOn 12/12/2024 at 06:38 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo:Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/12/2024 at 06:51 AM)\nSubject:Re: Safeco/Fidelity\nI have all the stock sales (I’ll share in email).\nIt’s the cost basis that I need to figure out.\nAre you open to the payment a day later?",
