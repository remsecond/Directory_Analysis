Hi,

I need to provide an update on several items and discuss the upcoming schedule:

1. Last Week's Doctor Appointment (Dec 7):
   - Sarah's pediatrician visit went well
   - Next follow-up scheduled for January 15, 2024
   - Vaccination records have been updated in the portal

2. This Week's School Events:
   - Parent-teacher conference completed on Dec 12
   - Winter concert scheduled for Dec 16 at 3 PM
   - Need to coordinate pickup after the concert

3. Upcoming Schedule Changes:
   - This weekend (Dec 16-17): Need to change pickup time to 3pm instead of 2pm due to the concert
   - Next week (Dec 18-22): Sarah has daily swim practice from 4-5 PM
   - Christmas Break (Dec 23-Jan 7): Proposed schedule attached
   - January appointments:
     * Dental check-up: Jan 10, 2pm
     * Pediatrician follow-up: Jan 15, 3pm
     * School counselor meeting: Jan 17, 1pm

4. Previous Schedule Notes:
   - Thanksgiving weekend exchange worked well
   - November parent-teacher conference notes are in the portal
   - October dental appointment records updated

The location for all exchanges will remain the same (Community Center).

Please review and confirm these arrangements, especially the Christmas Break schedule.

Thanks,
Parent1
