# Email Processor Server Checkpoint - 2024-01-13

## Current State

The email processor has been enhanced and converted into a standalone server with improved functionality and integration capabilities.

### Components
1. **Core Email Processor** (`index.ts`)
   - Enhanced header parsing
   - Improved MIME type handling
   - Better attachment processing
   - Fixed content-type serialization

2. **Server Implementation** (`server.ts`)
   - Standalone server architecture
   - Process-based communication
   - Type-safe message handling
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Configuration** (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`)
   - Updated dependencies
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Build and test scripts
   - Development tools

### Working Features
- ✓ PDF text extraction
- ✓ Email header parsing
- ✓ MIME type handling
- ✓ Metadata extraction
- ✓ Attachment processing
- ✓ Error handling
- ✓ Type safety
- ✓ Process communication

### Test Results
- Sample email processing successful
- Header formatting working correctly
- MIME type serialization fixed
- Metadata extraction accurate
- Process communication verified

## Changes Made

### Architectural Changes
1. Converted to standalone server
2. Removed MCP SDK dependency
3. Implemented process-based communication
4. Enhanced type safety system

### Technical Improvements
1. Fixed header parsing issues
2. Improved MIME type handling
3. Enhanced error handling
4. Added TypeScript interfaces
5. Improved test coverage

### Documentation Updates

## Integration Status

The email processor can now be integrated with the main pipeline through process messages:

```typescript
const emailProcessor = fork('path/to/email-processor-server');

emailProcessor.send({
  type: 'processEmail',
  args: {
    filePath: 'path/to/email.pdf',
    format: 'pdf',
    options: {
      includeMetadata: true,
      extractAttachments: true,
      parseHeaders: true
    }
  }
});
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add more test cases
2. Enhance PDF extraction quality
3. Improve attachment handling
4. Add email validation

### Future Improvements
1. Add support for more email formats
2. Enhance reply chain parsing
3. Implement email threading
4. Add batch processing support
5. Implement caching
6. Enhance security measures

### Integration Tasks
1. Update pipeline documentation
2. Add integration examples
3. Create deployment guide
4. Add monitoring capabilities

## Notes
- All core functionality is working as expected
- Type safety has been significantly improved
- Integration with the pipeline is straightforward
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

## Dependencies
- mailparser: ^3.6.5
- pdf.js-extract: ^0.2.1
- TypeScript: ^5.3.3
- Node.js types: ^20.10.5

## Build and Test
```bash
npm install
